<p>The dorm supervisor handed over the envelope to the gathered crowd, it was all she could do as instead of being addressed to one of the gathered ladies, the envelope was instead addressed to "all in the St. Beatrix dormitories in the Pontefactual Faculty of Theology Sardinia."</p>
<p>Maria grabbed it first and none of the assembled disagreed, she took the lead on these sort of things. The six or seven others gathered waited patiently.</p>
<p>The St. Beatrix dormitories had a nickname throughout the university, Jesus' Dowry. Every student staying there was a girl studying a theological course designed to prepare them for taking the vows of sisterhood and becoming a nun. There was plenty of jokes and misogyny aimed at them but at the same time the group remained tight knit with an air of arrogance at the supposed inevitability of their deep relationship with Jesus. The dorm supervisor hung around as Maria slid her sharp nails along the envelope just in case one of the boys on campus had decided to take a unique approach to sending dick pics to the group that famously didn't carry phones.</p>
<p>Confetti fell from the envelope (annoying the supervisor certain that she would have to clean that up) and Maria read the sparkly gold letter to the assembled gang.</p>
<p>"Ladies of St. Beatrix dorm. The International Local Circus of Risk is coming to Sardinia." she began.</p>
<p>"How can it be both local and international?" Gabriella interrupted, looking up from her latest textbook and blowing her chestnut bangs out of her eyes.</p>
<p>"Let her finish and you might find out, there's a time and a place to be a nerd." Sofia retorted, staring in wonder at her heroine Maria as she continued to read.</p>
<p>"This circus is strictly invite only and we are prepared to offer you as many tickets as you would like for a rock bottom price of 5 Euros each, courtesy of a well-connected member of staff." the next paragraphs were details of how to book tickets and where the circus would be.</p>
<p>"Should we go?" Sofia asked, looking to Maria for guidance, Maria made a play of thinking deeply about the letter, to ensure all gathered were hanging on her every whim. Benedetta, the most pious of the crowd interrupted as social structures never really influenced her.</p>
<p>"Don't people usually wear quite revealing outfits to the circus? Not to mention there may be drinking and other immoralities going on." Benedetta fiddled with the family rosary beads she kept constantly around her neck, wincing as they caught her curly red hair.</p>
<p>"I think we should go, we will be exposed to a lot of sin in the world and if we go as a group we can support each other and our faith in god can only grow." Maria retorted, partially out of spite and partially because she was certain to win some allies that way.</p>
<p>"Well I'm in" Sofia replied immediately,</p>
<p>"Should be interesting" Gabriella added, before going back to her book.</p>
<p>"Well I'm not going." Benedetta snapped, putting her foot down, "and what's more I'm going to tell the Professor, this does not seem OK, you may want to damn your souls but you're not going to drag me down with you."</p>
<p>Benedetta fussed and objected as the gang of future nuns pushed her into the circus tent, cursing her curiosity and pushy friends. Maria handed the tickets over to the usher, who promptly informed them they were gold ticket holders and ushered them to a large booth, with the exact number of seats they had ordered, comfy and spacious.</p>
<p>They all took their seats while the Usher left the booth and locked the door behind him.</p>
<p>The girls made idle small talk while they waited for the show to start, Maria and Sofia bursting with agreement about how much they deserved this, while Gabriella buried her nose in a book, and Benedetta said a small prayer for her immortal soul; pen and paper at the ready to record any sins that would need to be confessed later on.</p>
<p>The lights dimmed and in the centre ring a ringmaster walked out, his grin the only thing greasier than his hair and moustache.</p>
<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to the International Local Circus of Risk" Gabriella shuddered once again at the contradiction. "Firstly let's have a cheer from all the gold ticket holders." Maria and Sofia gave a loud cheer, while Benedetta gave a meek chirp of support and Gabriella remained silently judging. "Now the people in the other seats know what is special about the gold tickets but I see some looks of confusion among the booths, so let me explain how the circus works. The reason this circus is both local and international, is that although the organisers travel, the performers are all local people, and for anyone holding a golden ticket, the performer is someone you know." the ringmaster allowed a moment for murmurs to spread among the gathered crowd before resuming with his opening speech. In the distance Benedetta could have sworn she heard some scraping followed by a thud.</p>
<p>"You see when the circus was founded in 1888, circuses were in an arms race for who could do the most risky acts, risk of injury had recently been supplanted by risk of death as standard and safety nets began being removed left right and centre. But our founder asked is there a fate worse than death that could really provide a show, how about the destruction of the life you have built? The annihilation of your professional and social standing. The dead do not have to live with the consequences of a failed stunt but our performers tonight will find one wrong move will stay with them for the rest of their lives."</p>
<p>More confusion spread among the booths as the ringmaster engaged in another over-dramatic pause.</p>
<p>"I see there is still some confusion among you, so perhaps a practical demonstration. In booth one, our golden ticket holders are all from Monsignor Primary School. They may be wondering why barriers have just been drawn between each individual in their booth. It's so one of you could sneak away to do this..." A second spotlight turned on with a pop and above the ringmaster, a middle aged woman carefully made her way across a tightrope wearing nothing but a jewel encrusted cat mask covering her whole head. The crowd erupted into gasps as she slowly made her way from one platform to another.</p>
<p>"First things first kitty cat. I need you to tell the audience that you took on this risk of your own free will, that nobody is blackmailing you or forcing you to do this, please give the audience a thumbs up if this is true." the tightrope walker obliged, shocking the audience into silence with her outstretched thumb. "Brilliant! So here's the genius of the show, at any other circus if the performer fell off the rope they would drop clumsily into a net or, if the show was particularly macabre, to the hard ground below. For us though, there is a small string attaching that mask to the ceiling, if our performer were to fall she will land safe and sound into the net below, but the mask is not falling with her."</p>
<p>"As you can imagine, someone who does this can't be allowed to work at a school, she's risking her career, her friendships and her dignity all at once. This is why she is being paid â‚¬10,000 for this act, but as a cherry on top if she falls she doesn't get a cent." The naked woman had made it halfway across the tightrope and was now starting to shake a little, partially at the ringmaster reminding her what was at stake, partially at the skipping rope being lowered from the ceiling.</p>
<p>"Now then, our performer here agreed to ten jumps on the skipping rope before leaving with her dignity intact." The ringmaster stated. She reached out with a shaking hand, untangling the skipping rope. Each jump was not very high but it was high enough to clear the swinging rope and make her breasts bounce in the rhythm of the skip, the crowd counting with each twirl of the rope. When she finished her skips she let out a scream of delight. She stuffed the rope into one hand and threw it into the audience in triumph.</p>
<p>Time seemed to stop as the jerking motion of an unplanned move shifted the performer's weight backward. She had not trained for this moment and desperately leaned forward to compensate. The crowd watched with horrified delight as the performer fell the mask twanging off her head to reveal a fleeting blur of blonde hair. As she hit the net her hands were clasped firmly over her face as the ringmaster went to help her down.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, Evelina Romano, deputy headmistress at Monsignor Primary school, take a bow!" The lady's whole body was red with humiliation as the crowd cheered and the ringmaster held her hand up in triumph, directing her to bow at the booth where all her friends and colleagues were watching in shocked silence. As she staggered off to the side the ringmaster quipped, "good luck with the job hunt."</p>
<p>Aside from the teachers' booth, the only other booth that sat silent in this applause was that holding the girls from St. Beatrix's dorm.</p>
<p>"I knew it was a mistake to come here." Benedetta announced storming towards the door.</p>
<p>"Why are you leaving?" Maria sneered. "Got a performance to prepare for?" Benedetta froze in outraged silence.</p>
<p>"How dare you! I am leaving as I do not want to be a part of this circus of sin, and everyone else here should be leaving too." She shouted.</p>
<p>"The way I see it." Maria chimed, her words cutting through the air. "One of us here is a filthy pervert. If we leave now we will be sharing our dorm with a pervert, graduating with a pervert and will be complicit in allowing a pervert to join the most holy orders that we plan to pledge ourselves to. I do not want to be here but part of what makes a good nun is doing one's duty matter how uncomfortable it makes me. We must stay to figure out the identity of this disgraceful character hiding in our midst." She surmised crossing her arms, Sofia sat defiantly next to her and was overjoyed to see some of the other gathered ladies match.</p>
<p>"Going to be honest Benedetta," Gabriella interjected, "I want to leave too, but we all know the first person out of that door is going to be top of the list of suspects. Just sit quietly, say your prayers and don't look and it will all be over soon." Benedetta thought for a moment before sitting down in a huff as the stage was cleared and the ringmaster retook his post.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen! Now that we are all clear about the quirks of the little get-together, time to announce the second of five acts. Please bear in mind, every woman came here tonight of her own free will, looking for the ultimate rush, a risk to top any risk any other human being has ever taken. If you are looking to enrol in the circus next time we're in town our number is on the back of your programs." Gabriella actually decided to get a program, studying it for her own curiosity and to see if she could get any clues on who amongst them had decided to take such a devious risk.</p>
<p>"Our second act tonight is a local foster mother. She has been fostering children for some time, an ideal citizen. But tonight she has taken the night off from being a good mother to put on a show, and in her booth, everyone from the local council's fostering department. Her risk tonight is that the council would have no choice but to take away her foster children and not allow her any more if they knew what her heart desires. She has also told us that she has kept this a secret from her husband, but if they take away her foster children I'm sure they would have to tell him why. Please welcome to the stage Flashy the clown!"</p>
<p>From the entrance walked out a skinny woman, covered head to toe in clown makeup. Her body was paled by white paint with colourful polka dots. Her pussy and nipples the only unpainted parts. On her face she had a big red smile painted around her mouth, a bulbous red prop nose, green and blue stars painted around her eyes and to top it off a mess of purple curly hair.</p>
<p>"Hello Flashy!" The ringmaster announced, soliciting a smile and a wave from the clown. "Now flashy I understand you want to show everyone your unicycling talents, is that right?" The clown nodded with determination while the ringmaster picked the unicycle out of the box, in every aspect it was a normal unicycle, except for the big floppy dildo sticking out of the seat.</p>
<p>"So tonight flashy is going to do five laps of the circle on her special unicycle, fun stuff already but where's the risk? Well Flashy's makeup isn't like normal clown makeup, everything on her, even the curly hair wig, is water soluble. So to ensure she makes good time, we're going to have a water cannon time her laps. Too slow and poor flashy here loses her anonymity and with it her family and her life as she knows it. Once again the stakes are high, that's why Flashy is being paid â‚¬10,000, payable only if she succeeds."</p>
<p>Flashy began to look a bit more nervous as she took the unicycle and began to ease the seat dildo into her dripping pussy, collecting her wits long enough to hop upright, driving the dildo deep into her and beginning her unicycle ride. She started by steadying herself before cycling to the edge of the ring. Meanwhile in the centre of the ring, a cannon rose up and pointed just behind her. The ringmaster led the audience in a countdown before activating the jet of water from the cannon, beginning the chase.</p>
<p>As the clown pumped her thighs, it was clear that she was going to find the dildo driving in and out of her hard to ignore. She got some early distance but the cannon was not going to get exhausted and she was already starting to sweat.</p>
<p>In the booth, the theology students were each dealing with what was happening in their own way. Maria and Sofia sat mumbling to one another, relishing their feelings of superiority to mask their genuine interest and hope that the girl would be exposed. Benedetta had her head firmly down in prayer, but would occasionally glance upwards, before returning to pray forgiveness for giving into her curiosity. Gabriella was watching the show intently, but occasionally looking at the gathered ladies, hoping to deduce something from their reactions to what was unfolding.</p>
<p>By the fourth lap Flashy was looking worried, her aching thighs coupled with constant orgasms had slowed her pace, allowing the water to gain on her. To make matters worse her sweat had started to do the job for the water cannon anyway, the paint was starting to run down her body and in amongst the curly purple hair, a strand of brown hair had freed itself. As she turned for the last lap, Maria and Sofia had actually found themselves cheering for Flashy, leading to a few other girls cheering with them, while Gabriella cocked an eyebrow and Benedetta prayed for the clowns salvation (from both evil and the water fountain.)</p>
<p>The water splashing on her back, Flashy collapsed over the finish line, the water cannon cutting out just short of her. She lay on the ground twitching for some time before the ringmaster got her up and lead her backstage, her identity safe.</p>
<p>"I always love a happy ending. Let's see if our next performer can be so lucky." The ringmaster announced. "Today we have a repeat performer, last time this lady dazzled us with her skills on the trapeze. This time she has returned because, in her own words, 'that was too easy.' So tonight we're going to have her try out her latest skill, escapology." A tall statuesque woman entered the performers circle wearing a cartoonish pig mask, stood upright and unashamed of her nudity, pulling behind her a cage filled with equipment for her performance.</p>
<p>"Tonight we welcome back representatives from the five largest corporations in Italy with a female CEO, who will sit in that booth and think about how there is a one in five chance you're watching the head of your company humiliate herself. Now if I can have some volunteers from the audience to help tie up our performer." a few men came forward amongst the huddled masses and began tying the woman into the specially prepared straightjacket, securing her arms across her torso, pulling her breasts through the specially prepared holes.</p>
<p>"While she prepares I will also point out that the financial side of this performer is different. As she is already quite wealthy she has decided to perform for free. But should she fail, as well as losing her anonymity, she has agreed to pay us â‚¬100,000. What can I say, the lady is a gambler."</p>
<p>The volunteers were directed to surround the lady in ropes and chains, before she gingerly climbed into the cage, sitting upright with her legs stretched to the corners. Once inside the cage, the lid was closed leaving her he'd poking out of a specially made hole in the bars at the top. Clips attached to the bars by string were clips around her nipples, the audience were treated to an ecstatic groan as the string was tightened. Her feet were cuffed to the far corners of the cage and then additional clips were attached to her labia and used to pull her drenched pussy open for the audience.</p>
<p>"Now everyone, our little piggy here will have to escape her bonds quickly if she wants to keep the life she has made." The ringmaster announced, attaching a wire to the top of her mask that extended into the rafters. "The timer mechanism is simple, I'm going to light this fuse wire here, it will do five laps of the circle, let's say at the speed of a horny unicyclist. Once it has done that it will set fire to this bag full of gunpowder that's holding back the counterweight, when the bag goes up, the weight drops and the mask ascends." All thoughts of piety in the St. Beatrix booth had been forgotten for the suspense.</p>
<p>"Oh and one more thing" the ringmaster added with a mischievous grin. "We didn't have enough gunpowder to completely fill the bag, so I hope you don't mind but we also put all your clothes from tonight in there as well." This clearly shocked the performer, not only would she be risking exposure, she would have to go home naked as well, she began straining against her bonds and the ringmaster took that as an opportunity to light the fuse.</p>
<p>The fuse wire sparked its way around the ring as the piggy struggled against her bonds, the air was a cacophony of fizzing, clanging and groans as the bounds shifted and the clips pulled against punished flesh.</p>
<p>One by one the chains and rope began to fall to the ground, but the straitjacket was not shifting. As the St. Beatrix girls in the booth watched mystified, a loud rumble began to emanate from behind them, dividing walls began to move into position separating all the chairs. Before any of the girls could react they all found themselves suddenly cut off from all their friends. The next sound caught all their attention, the sound of a door opening at the back of the booth and a slight pause before it closes again. Whoever was the secret slut of the group had now left to prepare for her own humiliation. The remaining girls could do nothing but go back to watching the escapology act in front of them and it was not going well.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the audience, this performer had asked for the circus to surprise her, her clothes in the gunpowder bag were one such surprise but the clips on the cage were another and she had not practised with them. To take off the clips she needed her hands free, to get her hands free she needed to pull the straitjacket over her head and the nipple clips were not allowing her to do so. She struggled and screamed with her predicament before letting out a big sob and resigning herself to her fate.</p>
<p>The audience gasped as her clothes went up with a whoosh, and suddenly the pig mask whisked upwards, revealing the distraught face of a stern brunette.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, Serena Rosso, CEO of Smooth Sailing Investments! Fun fact, her company makes most of their money offering low risk investment portfolios. But I guess low risk isn't everyone eh Serena?" The ringmaster quipped while members of the crew untied her.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Once freed the stern brunette stood tall, took a deep breath, then smiled and took a bow, even blowing a kiss to her booth. She then strutted out of the circus, making sure to shake her hips and ensure everyone in the audience would stare at her exposed bottom until she was behind the curtain.</p>
<p>The remaining girls from St. Beatrix dorm all felt a rush of curiosity, they could all tell the next act was someone they knew.</p>
<p>"And now ladies and gentlemen our penultimate act. I can honestly say the following guest is the youngest performer we have ever had volunteer for the circus, it is rare for us to find someone willing to risk their future at such a young age. Our next act is a student currently studying at Pontefactual Faculty of Theology Sardinia. She and all her friends are all studying to become nuns. She has told us that if she were to fail today, not only could she no longer be a nun, all that she would have been studying for would be wasted and all her very religious family will disown her." The ringmaster pointed to the curtain at the back of the circus as it drew open.</p>
<p>Maria: "Alright let's find out who you are."</p>
<p>Sofia: "I hope it's not Maria."</p>
<p>Gabriella: "The ringmaster has already given me some clues, but I need more information."</p>
<p>Benedetta: "I can't believe what is about to happen."</p>
<p>The slender and pale naked body emerged from behind the curtain, she wore a full nun's habit, with her face covered by a transparent mask. She waved to the crowd but her nerves were making her knees shake as she approached the centre ring.</p>
<p>Maria: "oh my God! What a pervert."</p>
<p>Sofia: "she's so pale."</p>
<p>Gabriella: "can't make out the eye colour from here, shaved pubis means no way to tell hair colour either."</p>
<p>Benedetta: "this is so disgraceful."</p>
<p>"For our nun friend here, our circus has gone high tech." The ringmaster announced. "Inside that habit are a series of motors attached to threads, meaning the mask will fall apart if it receives a signal from a sensor at the side of the circle. That sensor is checking if either of these three juggling clubs touches the ground. Now we've put together an obstacle course of sorts for her to run while juggling, but that looks a bit easy doesn't it ladies and gentlemen? So how about we bring back the unicycle!"</p>
<p>Maria: "she's going to run an obstacle course on that unicycle whilst juggling. That's pretty impressive."</p>
<p>Sofia: "she's looking so calm while everyone cheers for her, maybe it is Maria."</p>
<p>Gabriella: "this doesn't look easy, she must have spent time practicing. Who in our group hasn't been around recently?"</p>
<p>Benedetta: "Lord deliver this poor perverted wretch from her sinful situation."</p>
<p>The performer took ahold of the unicycle a prepared to mount it, she pulled her pussy lips apart and in a burst of madness decided to show the audience how wet she was before pushing the unicycle dildo into her pussy. She hopped the unicycle upright, moving backwards and forwards to stay in one spot while the dildo churned in her. One by one the ringmaster threw her juggling clubs and she began to toss them in the air, recklessly risking her anonymity.</p>
<p>Maria: "the pervert has skills."</p>
<p>Sofia: "if this girl isn't Maria, she's still the coolest person in the world."</p>
<p>Gabriella: "she looks like she may make it, then how will I figure out who she is?"</p>
<p>Benedetta: "this is different to how I imagined."</p>
<p>The naked nun slowly made her way to the start of the obstacle course. There was a balance beam about a foot off the ground, a series of speed bumps, some swinging pendulums and finally a treadmill on a slight incline.</p>
<p>Maria: "look at the crowd, this girl is popular."</p>
<p>Sofia: "I wonder what it is like to be the centre of attention like that."</p>
<p>Gabriella: "What if I went undercover? But then I'd be the one on the unicycle."</p>
<p>Benedetta: "This is wicked and sinful, I can't believe I'm starting to enjoy it."</p>
<p>The crowd held their breath as the naked nun went up the ramp onto the balance bar, her hands a flurry of activity desperate to keep the clubs from hitting the ground. She carefully got to the end of the beam and rolled her way day, steadying herself before the next task. The speedbumps were going to be tricky if she didn't power into them hard enough there was a risk she wouldn't make it over, which was bad news for her juggling clubs which she was throwing where she expected to be. As well as that the hopping motion to get over the speed bumps would pound the dildo straight into her pussy quite hard.</p>
<p>Maria: "I wonder if a crowd will ever cheer for me like this."</p>
<p>Sofia: "that's what it takes to be popular, you have to be brave."</p>
<p>Gabriella: "though I must admit, if I went undercover the experiential learning would be interesting"</p>
<p>Benedetta: "I should be honest with myself, I've been enjoying this since the start."</p>
<p>The crowd could hear the nun groan with delight after each speed bump she crossed. At one point she had to stop, clutching all the juggling clubs close to her as her body surrendered to a shuddering orgasm. It took every ounce of willpower she had to stay upright on the unicycle but despite everything she was able to keep going. She took a deep breath and once again began tossing her juggling clubs in the air, making those last few hops to overcome the speed bumps, flinging her anonymity in the air with reckless abandon.</p>
<p>Maria: "imagining me being out there is actually making me feel horny"</p>
<p>Sofia: "I wonder if I would be popular if I did this"</p>
<p>Gabriella: "I hope she does make it, that way the only way I have to find out her identity is to go undercover"</p>
<p>Benedetta: "I'm sorry heavenly father, but this is turning into the best night of my life."</p>
<p>Next is the three swinging pendulums, difficult enough to avoid but while juggling especially hard as the pendulum could still end up swatting a club out of mid-air. The nun steadied herself waiting for the right moment, she threw her club ahead of her and powered forward in a dash, snatching the club out of the air once clear of the first pendulum, feeling her pussy begin to throb with expectation of another orgasm. She powered through the second one as good as in practice, one more to go. She rolled the unicycle back and forwards waiting for an opportunity but the waves of pleasure below were becoming distracting. A slight mistiming and the club bounces off the pendulum. But the nun manages to spot this and reach out to grab it, bouncing her back off the pendulum but snatching the club before it could hit the ground.</p>
<p>Maria: "The whole point of this booth is that nobody can see me, I could touch myself and nobody would know."</p>
<p>Sofia: "Oh no! She almost dropped her club. But everyone is still rooting for her"</p>
<p>Gabriella: "OK so it's a deal, if she makes it I promise I will phone the number on the program and volunteer for the next circus"</p>
<p>Benedetta: "what a thrill ride, I'm loving every moment."</p>
<p>Finally it was the inclined treadmill, a final burst of power required from tired legs with the added risk that if she doesn't make it to the top, the treadmill will pull her away from any airborne juggling clubs. She needed to be absolutely focussed to do this but her pussy betrayed her. Thinking fast, she grabbed the juggling clubs and deliberately started rolling the unicycle backwards and forwards as hard as she could, letting herself feel another wave of orgasm roll over her body and clearing her head.</p>
<p>Maria: "this is so hot, I'm about to cum right inside this booth"</p>
<p>Sofia: "this is the greatest person in the world, I want to be just like her"</p>
<p>Gabriella: "go on whoever you are, I want you to make it, I want to be doing this next time the circus is in town"</p>
<p>Benedetta: "I have fallen, I'm sorry god but all I care about right now is pleasure"</p>
<p>The naked nun steadied herself once more, and prepared to do one last sprint to the end.</p>
<p>The St. Beatrix girls left the tent, all having thoroughly enjoyed their night but none willing to admit it to the others. Outside the crowd milled around discussing which their favourite part was and speculating about the identity of the government minister from the final act. There was some commotion in the car park where a naked CEO was turning down offers of clothes, she had decided to own her failure and walk all the way home from the circus naked.</p>
<p>The St. Beatrix girls got on the bus, all in silence broken only by a single question.</p>
<p>"So who do you think that was?" Maria asked the group.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a treat for you with our main event tonight!" The ringmaster announced. "Last time we were here a girl from the Pontefactual Faculty of Theology Sardinia was one of our performers. She made a classic mistake of enjoying herself too much. Since then she has become a fully-fledged nun, but still wanted to roll the dice one more time. But that's not all. After her performance, three other girls from that college asked to join the circus, also now nuns. So we have decided to put on a special show. For the gathered higher ups of the local diocese, we will have a four woman act."</p>
<p>Four naked women stood, looking wide eyed at the crowd behind their habit and masks. Goosebumps covering every millimetre of their exposed flesh. All four pussies visibly streaming at the thought of what lies ahead.</p>
<p>"For this act unlike the other acts tonight, the question will not be whether or not they will expose themselves. Whatever happens tonight, two of the performers will be unmasked. So, are you girls ready?"</p>
<p>Maria: "ready!"</p>
<p>Sofia: "ready!"</p>
<p>Gabriella: "ready!"</p>
<p>Benedetta: "ready!"</p>
