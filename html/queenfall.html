<p>Chapter 1: The Deal</p>
<p>From a young age the little princess Melissa was raised to serve her future husband and king, her choices and desires all forced upon her to better suit what the king desired in a future queen. But when the king died two years into their marriage, and no heirs could be found, Queen Melissa found herself in charge of a country and for the first time able to decide her own whims and desires. This burst of freedom eventually translated to experimenting with her sexuality (something the king had rarely cared for.) Melissa found herself able overcome years of sexual repression in a bursts of freedom.</p>
<p>It started small, at night she would walk the chambers in the royal with g of the castle without a stitch of clothing on her, no servants were allowed in at night so she was safe but she couldn't help but feel a rush as she caught her naked reflection in the full length mirror in what was a busy corridor during the day.</p>
<p>Queen Melissa had beauty routines forced into her at an early age, as such she was always on top of her fitness and well trimmed. Her long auburn hair was tended to every day to produce a shine that could melt hearts. Her large breasts didn't require effort to grow but were no less beautiful because of that.</p>
<p>This beauty filled her with confidence, her new found freedom with determination, and soon she found herself trying more and more adventurous activities to explore what had been repressed throughout her childhood.</p>
<p>She found herself venturing outside the royal wing in her late night walks, eventually wandering the whole castle and its gardens naked. She would often have close brushes with a few of the night servants but she was agile and quick witted enough to hide and get out of the way. Nevertheless she always felt disappointed in herself afterwards, like she had once again let her strict upbringing interfere with her freedom.</p>
<p>One night she decided that she would not hide, she always decided this and it never stuck in the heat of the moment but deep down she knew she wanted one of her servants to see her in all her glory. So one night she stripped down, and walked towards the royal gardens with a plan firmly focused in her mind. In the royal gardens there was only 1 door in and out, and the garden was surrounded by the outer wall of the castle so that door was the only way to enter and leave. The queen stepped through this door and shuddered with anticipation.</p>
<p>The queen felt the grass beneath her bare feet and the breeze on her naked body. She pulled the door closed, turned the key in the lock and held the key in her hand in front of herself. Queen Melissa steadied herself, in her hand was her only release, a small lump of metal that held the difference between sneaking back to bed without issue and exposing herself to the first servant who entered the gardens in the morning.</p>
<p>She put the key on the stone doorstep, and gave it a strong push so it skidded under the door and out of reach. There was no going back now. Her shivers grew stronger and her whole body ached with excitement, fear and regret. Her hand ventured south to calm her nerves and the results were explosive, leant against the tree she had the most liberating night in years, she was so consumed by wave after wave of pleasure she barely noticed the very reason she had done this, the first servant had entered the gardens and seen her Queen sprawled in ecstasy against a tree.</p>
<p>Beatrix was the head of the household in the royal house. Her job was to organise and manage all servant activities and ensure the royal's every whim was taken care of. This job required long hours and intense work, so Beatrix found that the best way to calm herself before a hard day's work was some silent meditation in the royal gardens. So every day she arrived about half an hour before the rest of the servants and would head straight to the royal gardens to centre herself.</p>
<p>"Your highness?" enquired Beatrix.</p>
<p>"Oh, um hello Beatrix, could you help me? I seem to have locked myself out." Queen Melissa chirped, she was trying to simply pass this off as an accident.</p>
<p>"Naked?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"With the key slid under the door and you pleasuring yourself in the corner here?" the queen was not expecting one of the smarter members of the royal household to discover her and Beatrix's questions were starting to worry her beyond what was comfortable.</p>
<p>"It is not your place to question the word of the queen!" Queen Melissa Bellowed, pulling herself up to her full height and looking down on the servant.</p>
<p>"Of course not your highness, however my duties are to cater to your every whim, sometimes this means reading between the lines and having ideas you don't want to admit to, for example I think you wanted to be seen naked."</p>
<p>This was bad, the queen was hoping for a jolly gardener to get a quick ogle at her tits, instead the head of the household just saw her more naked than she would have liked, she made a beeline for the door but discovered to her horror that Beatrix had locked it behind herself on her way into the garden. Beatrix dangled the key in front of her queen.</p>
<p>"Forgive my impertinence your majesty, but it seems I have been neglecting my duties to cater to your every whim, what you need is for someone to help organise outlets for your erotic energy. Someone who can make sure you get exactly what you want and stay safe." The queen looked Beatrix in the eye, it was a trap of course but she had a point and even if Melissa wasn't still too horny to resist such an offer, Beatrix had her only key to freedom.</p>
<p>"Very well" sighed the queen, "from now on your duties will include discovering and exploring my sexual desires, you will set up scenarios where I can enjoy myself without threatening my role as queen and I will not punish you for pushing my limits, do you agree?" on hearing this Beatrix offered her hand to shake, she knew once the queen shook her hand, they had an accord and it could not be broken. The queen hesitated and then offered her hand, she knew the pact was sealed.</p>
<p>"Thank you my queen, I will carry my new duties diligently."</p>
<p>"Thank you Beatrix, now may I have the key?"</p>
<p>"No your majesty, you are to finish masturbating at the base of that tree, if you do not finish before the next servant arrives I will use my keys to lock you out of the royal wardrobe and you will spend the day naked."</p>
<p>The shock the queen felt could have powered her country for a week. She stood agape for a minute before she got ahold of herself and walked back over to the tree bright red with shame. Beatrix guided her hand south to help the process along, then stood back and watched.</p>
<p>Queen Melissa had barely touched herself before she finished harder than ever before. Beatrix raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"It looks like my queen is very much into humiliation, here's the key, go back to your room and I will plan for tomorrow's activities."</p>
<p>The queen slipped away, feeling the deepest shame and desperately trying to hide how excited she was for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: The contract</p>
<p>Queen Melissa had been distracted all day, people were asking her to sign things about criminal justice reform and taxes, and all she cared about was that tonight Beatrix had something planned, something to push her boundaries and give her a new sense of shame.</p>
<p>As she ate dinner she noticed the servants were hurrying, performing their duties faster than usual, she barely had time to finish her dessert before her plate was snatched away for the cleanup.</p>
<p>When the bell tower chimed for 8pm she noticed that the only 2 people left in the castle were Beatrix and herself.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, I hope you don't mind, but I gave the rest of the servants the night off, they will have to see their queen humiliated another time." Melissa started to worry that Beatrix might be enjoying this too much.</p>
<p>Beatrix pulled out a small document, the queen instantly recognised it as a legally binding contract, similar to what she would sign to guarantee terms for royal appointments. She slid it across the table and it read as follows:</p>
<p>By the power of her majesty the queen, her Noble lineage and god almighty the following contract is sealed.</p>
<p>This contract is to change the conditions of employment for Beatrix Freeman (hereafter referred to as employee), by her Royal Majesty Queen Melissa Battleborn (hereafter referred to as employer)</p>
<p>1. Additional to the employee's current duties, the employee is now responsible for the employer's sexual well-being and tutelage through activities that expand the employer's range of sexual experiences.</p>
<p>2. This role comes with the title "Mistress", which is to be used by the employer while the employee is carrying out this role.</p>
<p>3. During the times when the employee is carrying out this role, they may choose to opt out of their legal obligation to refer to the employer as "your majesty" in favour of any title they feel appropriate. They are also under no obligation to treat the employer with royal deference or indeed respect.</p>
<p>4. The employee may compel the employer to engage in any act that serves the job role laid out in clause 1.</p>
<p>5. The employee may also compel the employee to complete tasks and set appropriate punishments for failing to achieve these tasks, so long as they serve the job role laid out in clause 1.</p>
<p>6. Any acts referred to in clauses 4 and 5 will hereafter be known as "actions"</p>
<p>7. The employer may choose to opt out of any actions if, and only if, the action's desired outcome meets of the following criteria:</p>
<p>i. The action risks serious bodily harm to the employer.</p>
<p>ii. The action would diminish the employer's ability to act as monarch.</p>
<p>iii. The action does not serve the job role laid out in clause 1</p>
<p>8. If at any point the employer wishes to invoke clause 7, they must say the safe word "Marzipan". At which point all actions must stop until it can be confirmed that the actions do not meet the clause 7 criteria.</p>
<p>9. The employee will face no negative ramifications (legal or otherwise) for actions undertaken in service of this new role.</p>
<p>10. This contract can only be terminated in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>i. The employee resigns.</p>
<p>ii. The employer marries</p>
<p>iii. The employer declares they wish to end the contract on 2 separate occasions, a week apart with no contradictory statements in between.</p>
<p>Beneath this there was an area to sign, Beatrix had already signed her section and placed the wax seal of her house alongside it. All that was left was the Queen's approval.</p>
<p>Melissa held the document in her shaking hand. Had she received a contract this one sided in her governmental duties she would never have signed it. But the thrill of what the contract entailed was drowning out all rational thought. She picked up her quill and let out a low moan as she signed. She then took her ring and a nearby candle, poured hot wax next to her signature, and stamped her royal seal.</p>
<p>Contract was now official and binding.</p>
<p>"Thank you your majesty, however there is one more piece of ceremony I would like you to indulge, so you know the true value of the contract. Next to the royal seal I want you to put your personal seal, pour more hot wax on the contract and then seal it with your pussy." Beatrix remained professional throughout this statement, however it occurred to the queen that nobody had ever used the word pussy in front of her, no one talked this way in front of a queen.</p>
<p>With her face turning a deep crimson she began to climb up onto the table with the contract before Beatrix interjected.</p>
<p>"Applying the seal would be much easier if you weren't wearing clothes, however it would be fitting if you remained wearing the crown." Melissa's head was swimming, all she could bring herself to do was nod and unbutton her dress. As it fell to the floor Beatrix took a moment to admire the fine silk underwear of the queen before encouraging her to continue.</p>
<p>Even though Melissa had been naked in front of Beatrix before removing her clothes with Beatrix watching was somehow more embarrassing. The dress had simply fell away but her bra and knickers would require work. She unclipped her bra and immediately felt the release in pressure as her breasts pushed against the untethered fabric. She tossed the bra to one side and gave a meek attempt at covering her sizable chest before realising the futility of her actions. She then hooked her thumbs around her waistband, closed her eyes and pushed down.</p>
<p>Now naked and stood on the table Melissa began to pour wax on the contract. She poured a larger pool than for a ring seal and then carefully squatted into position. The queen could only marvel at her graceless form, naked and squatting on the dining room table.</p>
<p>The queen felt a ball of heat hit her pussy and sent shockwaves up her body. In the shock she fell driving more hot wax into her sensitive areas. She let out a little squeak as the hot wax burned her skin and solidified. For the first time she noticed a crack in Beatrix's professionalism as a smile crawled onto her face.</p>
<p>Beatrix took the contract and held it up for the queen to see. The imprint of her pussy was slightly smudged by the fall but was still clearly defined and identifiable.</p>
<p>"Well now we have that agreed to, we're going to need to make some changes if we want you to flower into a sexually awakened slut queen" Beatrix exclaimed as she scooped up the royals clothes.</p>
<p>"What kind of changes?" Melissa enquired. She was answers by an almighty slap on the backside.</p>
<p>"The contract was clear that while I am engaging in this role you are to refer to me as Mistress." Melissa was reeling, she had never been spanked and the sudden need to refer to a servant with a title of superiority had also shocked her. She gulped and looked at her feet.</p>
<p>"I am sorry Mistress."</p>
<p>Beatrix smiled and led the queen to the royal bedchambers, the servants has lit the fire, made the bed and generally prepared the room for a good night's sleep Melissa was not going to get. Beatrix left the room briefly and came back with 2 drawers from the Queen's closet. They were filled with the most exquisite bras and knickers the kingdom could produce.</p>
<p>"Your first task is to throw all your underwear into the fire. As well as this you are forbidden from buying or wearing replacements. From now on you will be the commando queen."</p>
<p>Melissa looked pleadingly a Beatrix, this felt like more than she could bear.</p>
<p>"I gave you an order slut queen, burn your underwear or I will burn all your clothes except your underwear." The queen could see in Beatrix's eyes that this was not a threat and starting throwing all her underwear into the fire, giving up the right to conceal her raw sexuality, she picked up the last set of underwear, they were the ones bought for her by her parents, a form fitting and slimming on price bra and knickers, designed to force her figure into place under royal dresses. She closed her eyes and tossed them into the fire.</p>
<p>Once she was done Beatrix sat her down and explained that she would be setting rules for the queen to live by each week. This week's rules were as follows.</p>
<p>1. You are no longer allowed to use the royal privy, you must use the servant's toilets and are not allowed to lock the door.</p>
<p>2. You are not allowed to sit with your legs crossed, your legs must be open so anyone at the right angle could see your pussy.</p>
<p>3. You will not be sleeping in the royal bedchambers, you will report to the kennels where I will lock you in every night and release you first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Beatrix then added one more caveat that made the queen shiver with delight and fear.</p>
<p>For every time you disobey one of these rules, I will make you walk one lap of the outside of the castle naked, with your hands tied behind your back and bells on your nipples.</p>
<p>"So what do you say to that?" asked Beatrix. Melissa was swimming in her delight, Beatrix had started her down a road that she knew she would love and decided to make sure her answer reflected this level of approval.</p>
<p>"Please lead me to the kennels mistress, this slave bitch is tired."</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Dog days</p>
<p>Melissa awoke to the sound of dogs barking from the neighbouring kennels, someone was coming, she hoped and prayed it was Beatrix but she couldn't help wonder what would happen if it was a different servant. Her heart leapt as she saw Beatrix round the corner carrying a bucket. With no warning Beatrix tossed the bucket full of freezing water on the queen, driving her body numb with cold and driving out all tiredness.</p>
<p>"Good morning Your Majesty, in case you were wondering the hound master is a lazy drunk, he comes in late every day and doesn't think he is missing anything, so if he ever gets his act together we'll be right here to reward him won't we?"</p>
<p>"Yes mistress" shivered the queen, "what time do the other servants get here?"</p>
<p>"Oh they are already here, it's 9:15 and the servants start work at 9, you should probably get back to your chambers to put on some clothes." remarked Beatrix in a matter of fact way. Melissa crumbled into a ball of her limbs, the castle will be bustling, and there was no way she could make it back to her chambers without getting spotted.</p>
<p>"Please mistress, I can't walk back without being seen, surely there's something else I can do?" the queen pleaded. Beatrix gave a wide smirk to the queen.</p>
<p>"You are learning quickly. Fine, I will fetch you some royal robes, but you have to do something for me." the queen shivered with anticipation, she knew it would be something humiliating but nothing could be worse than all her servants seeing her naked. Beatrix opened the cage and immediately attached a dog collar to the queen, she hooked a lead around the dog collar and pulled a blindfold over the Queen's eyes so she was plunged into darkness, feeling only her humiliations. Using the lead Beatrix dragged the queen out towards the hounds exercise yards, these consisted of pens with a single pole in the centre. The pole had an extension sticking horizontally out of the top with a loop to attach a lead to. Beatrix attached the lead to the extension, and with a flip of a switch the pole started to rotate forcing the queen to walk on all fours in a circle.</p>
<p>"Keep walking attached to that pole until I get back and I will give you some clothes." Beatrix commanded, she started to walk away until she had an idea and turned back. "And also, at the moment you are a dog correct?"</p>
<p>"Yes mistress" replied the queen, bright red and walking in circles for anyone to see.</p>
<p>"Well then, you are to bark like a dog while you are being walked. If when I get back I don't hear you barking, then I will throw your clothes in the mud and lead you back to your chambers by your leash, are we clear?" the queen went to reply but then realised what Beatrix wanted to hear and let out a small yelp.</p>
<p>"Come on you can do better than that!" yelled Beatrix, giving the queen a smack on the rump for good measure. Melissa gave a loud bark, and kept barking as she heard Beatrix walk away.</p>
<p>Time lost all meaning for Beatrix, she kept walking and barking, feeling who whole body flush with heat every time she remembered her embarrassing situation and the possibility that someone other than Beatrix could hear the strange barking noises and come over to see what is happening. She tried to reach down to pleasure herself but every time she tried the exercise pole would pull her forward by the neck forcing her to keep walking. After what seemed like hours she heard footsteps approaching, she barked extra loud to make sure that Beatrix heard her so she wouldn't have to be punished. Her blindfold was peeled off and Melissa saw her mistress looming over her with one of her royal dresses, a standard red and gold affair with a high collar. She unhooked the queen from the leash and gave her the dress.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>"Here we go, a nice dress so everyone doesn't realise what a dirty bitch you are. Now you are going to act like a queen today but I don't want you forgetting you are a horny bitch in heat, so keep that collar on under your clothes." Beatrix ordered. The queen stammered out a response but was in a hurry to put her dress on, not just to be covered but to get back to her chambers and scratch the undeniable itch this session had caused. She had only just gotten the straps of her gown over her shoulders when the hound master arrived.</p>
<p>"And what time do we call this." Boomed Beatrix across the yard. "Her Majesty the Queen came to the kennels to give you a reward for all your hard work and you missed it because you are late." The hound master went as red as the queen.</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry your majesty, I promise you I will arrive at 9am sharp from now on." stammered the shaking man.</p>
<p>"We'll be looking forward to it." stated Beatrix, giving a subtle wink to the queen.</p>
<p>Once the queen had returned to her chambers, bathed herself and took care of her desires, Beatrix and the queen fell back into their usual roles. The queen quickly forgot about her humiliations in order to focus on the orders of the day. There were many bills coming out of parliament for her to sign and her coronation day celebrations were around the corner.</p>
<p>Partially because she had not had a good night's sleep in the dog kennel and partially because it was a long day's work, the queen informed the chef she would be skipping dinner and retired to her chambers to sleep before dinner time. When she awoke, Beatrix was looming over her with a tray of food covered in a cloche.</p>
<p>"Your majesty, we're sorry you couldn't make dinner, however I had some appropriate food made up for you." Beatrix smiled, holding the tray in one hand.</p>
<p>"Thank you Beatrix, what is it?" Melissa said, straightening up and reaching out for the tray.</p>
<p>"Not so fast you horny bitch, did you forget that you are wearing a dog collar, you will eat in these chambers but you will eat like a dog. Take off everything but your collar and then get down on all fours, you will not be allowed to use your hands to eat" Beatrix ordered. The queen was taken by surprise, but loved the firm tone that Beatrix took with her. She removed her dress and got on all fours with her ass in the air, wiggling as if she were a dog wagging her tail. Beatrix put the tray in front of her and removed the cloche causing Melissa's heart to stop.</p>
<p>On the tray was a dog bowl, filled with what was unmistakably dog food.</p>
<p>"Mistress please, you can't expect me to eat dog food." Melissa pleaded.</p>
<p>"Well I can't very well let my pet starve now can I? Now with most dogs in training you need to punish them if they don't behave, so if there is any food left in that bowl in 10 minutes, then I will ban you from all toilets in the castle for a week. Every time you need to go you will have to ask me permission and you will have to go outside, naked and on all fours like a dog." Beatrix sat back and watched the queen expectantly. Melissa took a deep breath, moved her hands behind her back and buried her face into the bowl.</p>
<p>The overwhelming smell and taste hit Melissa all at once, she pulled her face up and chewed on the meaty chunks in her mouth, gagging a little as she did. She then plunged her face into the bowl again. Melissa had been raised only eating the fanciest foods, she had learned every piece of cutlery and how it can be used to bring out the subtle and delicate tastes of meals prepared by the finest chefs in the land. Plunging her face into a bowl of a dog's gristle and jelly was a huge departure from what she was used to, this is why this was the most enjoyable meal Melissa had ever had. She wasn't standing on ceremony, nobody was expecting her to use the right utensils and eat with decorum, she loved being a dirty bitch gagging down dog food.</p>
<p>Melissa chomped through all the food, until there was only one chunk of meat left. Then, with her mind a cloud of arousal, she decided to walk away from that last chunk and leave the bowl with some food left in it. She knew what punishment awaited her and it only made her more excited.</p>
<p>"Well then" replied Beatrix, surprised at her queens lust for humiliation, "I guess you enjoy being a dog, in which case let's get you to the kennels, We'll go via the gardens where you can relieve yourself" Beatrix affixed the leash and walked the queen through the hallways of the castle, occasionally ducking behind a pillar or into a room to avoid one of the night servants. When she got to the kennels Beatrix tossed he in her usual kennel.</p>
<p>"I'll be here to pick you up at 9:15, let's hope the hound master is on time tomorrow shall we?"</p>
<p>Chapter 4: The slipping mask</p>
<p>"You know one of these days the hound master is going to arrive for work on time," remarked Beatrix, in the process waking a naked and sleeping queen from the kennels "I'm very disappointed he hasn't had a chance to see his queen, naked and caged like a dog."</p>
<p>It had been the best part of a week since Beatrix had begun acting as the queen's mistress. Since the night of dog food Beatrix had scaled it back a little, relying on the queen's existing punishment of going outside like a dog to keep Melissa on a light simmer. Melissa was getting worried that Beatrix was taking it easy on her and knew that their contract of employment required Beatrix to keep pushing her boundaries.</p>
<p>Beatrix let the queen out of the kennel and handed her a dress, as a little act of rebellion the queen carried her dress across the courtyard and didn't put it on until she was standing outside the door to the castle. Beatrix smiled a knowing smile trying to reassure the queen that something was on the horizon.</p>
<p>There was an unusual light-heartedness to the servants today, they smiled at the queen from the eyes, not just at the mouth as decorum commanded. The queen wondered if maybe stories of her adventures were making their way among the help, but remembered that it would violate the contract as if anyone knew about her training, her authority as a monarch would be lessened.</p>
<p>During a lunchtime function with the city's chamber of commerce in the ballroom, Melissa excused herself and went to ask Beatrix's permission to relieve herself. Beatrix led her out of one of the side corridors, doubled back and ended up at the far end of the visitor's garden. This garden faced onto the ballroom and several of the delegation were taking their drinks outside.</p>
<p>"As you can see there is a small hedge running along the garden from this door to that tree, if you stay on all fours none of the people should see you... providing they don't decide to explore the garden further. Also if you relieve yourself before you reach the tree, I will close this door and lock it so you have to head back through the ballroom."</p>
<p>The queen was familiar with the routine but not with this level of danger, she quickly had her dress off and scurried to the tree. She felt those familiar butterflies in her stomach and tingling down her body, however she was finished too soon, she re-joined Beatrix and once again did not immediately put her dress on while staring Beatrix in the eye. Beatrix smiled.</p>
<p>"I understand queen bitch is upset with not being pushed far enough, so I'll tell you what, today I want you to retire to your bedchambers early again. I will then meet you and I'll make sure you have a night to remember, and as for your current protests..." Beatrix plucked the dress from the queen's hand and threw it over the hedge and into a pond "fetch!"</p>
<p>Beatrix walked away leaving the queen alone and naked with her dress soaking in the pond. Melissa knew if she went to get it, there would be nothing between her and the party guests. However she had to hurry as currently any guest who looked over would see a discarded royal dress in the pond and would begin to ask questions.</p>
<p>At that moment there were two guests on the edge of the garden talking, only one was facing her way but it only took one person to see. As the queen hesitated she heard Beatrix's voice coming from the hall.</p>
<p>"Excuse me everyone! I'm sorry to say that we have to bring this evening to a close, there is another event scheduled to happen in the ballroom and we need to set up"</p>
<p>The two people drinking outside wandered inwards and the queen was able to jump over and start to pick her dress out of the pond.</p>
<p>"However if you want to roam the royal gardens while you finish your drinks we would be happy to accommodate you." the queen froze in fear, she had her dress but she was still naked and her dress was soaked. She was out in the open and about to have the entire party descend on the gardens.</p>
<p>The queen thought fast and decided to be impulsive. She jumped into the pond with her dress, the cold and wet hit her all at once, suspending her in cold isolation. She was able to snap out her shock long enough to pull the dress under with her, she roughly pulled it on and surfaced.</p>
<p>"Your majesty, did you fall?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm sorry to concern you, it's these gardens, you never to get the hang of them." and with that the crowd helped the queen out of the pond, unaware that she was stark naked just 10 seconds ago. However without underwear, the whole party managed to get a good look at the Queen's figure, and could clearly see her raised nipples.</p>
<p>The queen followed Beatrix's commands and retired early. Then at 8pm on the dot Beatrix arrived, she was carrying the leash but no food.</p>
<p>"Today is going to be a special treat for you queen bitch, you will be dining in the ballroom, come on, let's go!" the queen stood agog as Beatrix applied the lead and pulled her towards the door. "Not that it should matter, but at this moment there is only one human being and one bitch queen in this castle, however it won't be that way for long so I suggest you heal like a good dog."</p>
<p>Melissa followed behind Beatrix on all fours and was shocked at how empty the castle was, there was not a servant to be seen, she didn't want to question Beatrix's ways but this intrigued her. As she got to the ballroom, she arrived to a room filled with food, drink and party decorations.</p>
<p>"The reason nobody is here tonight is that tonight is the servant's pre-coronation party, something I concocted a couple of years ago to raise moral before we have a lot of long days, working hard at the coronation anniversary preparations. You will see your food is on the stage at the front of the room, you are not allowed to leave until it is finished. Now the party is due to start at 8:30, but you know how there's always those who want to get here early."</p>
<p>Melissa finally understood the situation she had been put in, if she didn't get to that stage soon and wolf down the food, the naked queen would be the centrepiece of a party for her servants. She sprinted to the stage on all fours and leaned over a bucket at the front of the stage with her exposed ass facing her potential audience. The bucket contained a large helping of dog food, supplemented with scraps of rotten food salvaged from the kitchen bins and some other things that Melissa didn't want to think about. Just like last time Mistress forced her to eat dog food, she placed her hands behind her back and dove in face first.</p>
<p>The overwhelming smells and tastes assaulting the Queen's delicate palate dulled her senses, and with her head in the bucket and the sound of her eating, she could not see or hear the ballroom she had left behind. Her humiliation intensified with the knowledge that servants could have already arrived and right now could be watching their supreme ruler's ass bob up and down while her face is buried in a bucket of filth, gorging on its contents like a disgusting pig.</p>
<p>She choked down everything between gags, even taking the time to lick the bottom of the bucket clean.</p>
<p>As she looked up she saw the hall was empty apart from Beatrix, she couldn't help but feel a little disappointed while she waited for Beatrix to give her the next command.</p>
<p>"Wow, what a dirty pig you have become. Well you royal pigness. Follow me and we'll get you cleaned up." Beatrix walked up to the stage and once again took the leash in order to lead Beatrix backstage. There were changing rooms for when performers would put on shows for those gathered in the ballroom. As Beatrix bundled Melissa into one she turned to leave.</p>
<p>"Clean yourself up while I greet our guests." the queen could hear the murmur of conversations happening in the ballroom and the sound of a small band starting their set where she was just a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>Melissa wiped the filth from her face using a basin in the room and began using the sponge to wipe down her sweat covered body. As her hand went south she got carried away and began to play with herself, however her fun was interrupted by the sound of Beatrix's voice booming from the ballroom.</p>
<p>"Alright guys quiet down, as you all know, it's about to get very busy around here, so please relax and enjoy yourselves tonight. The kitchen has rustled up the best food and more wine and ale then any of us could drink in a lifetime, including you George, and there is an extra special treat coming up. I've been speaking to the queen, and she is so grateful for all your hard work that she has agreed to come here and do a strip show for you all."</p>
<p>Melissa froze, the whole room lost focus and her heart started beating harder and faster than it ever has before. Beatrix couldn't be serious, could she? There were murmurs and sporadic laughter from the crowds as Beatrix finished her speech. None of them believed her but Melissa's mind was swirling with the possibility that she was telling the truth.</p>
<p>Next thing Melissa knew Beatrix had returned to the dressing room.</p>
<p>"You're not serious about me stripping for all the servants are you?" The queen pleaded.</p>
<p>"I am entirely serious, in fact, the outfit I want you to strip out of is in that cupboard." Beatrix stated, pointing at a small cupboard in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>Inside the cupboard Melissa found some gold sheer suspenders with a suspender belt. A gold shiny bikini with a string thong and cups barely big enough to contain Melissa's ample breasts, and a low quality imitation of the Queen's formal robes, the ones she wore for the official portrait with which the entire country is familiar. Finally on the end of the rack, Melissa found a mask that covered the whole head, crudely shaped and painted to look like a caricature of the queen.</p>
<p>"Once you put that mask on nobody will know who is stripping, they'll think you are a stripper pretending to be the queen, when in reality you will be the queen pretending to be a stripper." Beatrix whispered in the Queen's ear, stroking her body up and down in order to put her in the mood to make bad choices.</p>
<p>Melissa sighed thinking about how her position as monarch was protected, relieved of that she was starting to look forward to it. Soon all her servants would see her naked body. She was especially looking forward to conducting her day to day business in front of servants, knowing they had no idea that they had seen their queen naked.</p>
<p>Melissa practically jumped into the slutty queen outfit and closed her eyes as she pulled the mask over her head. It was reassuringly tight, freeing the queen to move how she wanted without risking it falling off. Once she was all dressed up she looked to Beatrix, who smiled and lead her towards the stage.</p>
<p>Melissa waited in the wings while Beatrix strode out onto stage and the music stopped.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for our honoured guest, her majesty Queen Melissa!"</p>
<p>The queen was in a dream world as she stepped out from the side. All eyes were on her and she knew what she was going to have to do next. The band played the national anthem and Melissa waved to the crowd in a regal way, then at once the music turned slow and saucy, she knew this was the cue to start dancing.</p>
<p>Melissa had been given dancing lessons when she was younger, it was thought important to maintain a princess's grace in movement. Although Melissa remembered these lessons, she had decided to forgo any sense of grace in favour of a humiliatingly overt display of sexuality. She ran her hands up and down the dress, shaking her hips and squeezing herself all over. She had barely been dancing a minute before she turned her back to the audience, unzipped the back of the dress, and wiggled her hips until it fell to the floor.</p>
<p>The roar of applause and catcalling washed over Melissa, waves of pleasure emanating from the knowledge of how little the gold bikini covered. She turned continued to dance, letting the audience drink in the sight of the barely clad queen. As she got into the rhythm she built up the courage for what was to come next, she unhooked the bra and in a spin and a flourish it was flung to the audience.</p>
<p>The cheering got louder and louder and the queen was feeling every beat of the song through her. She expected that she was to keep the suspenders on so the only thing left to take off was the string bikini bottoms. Ever growing in confidence she turned away from the audience, bent over and slowly pulled down the thong, spreading her cheeks as she did to give the whole audience a clear view of everything. The saucy music and the booming cheer of the crowd covering Melissa's moans of orgasmic joy at having revealed everything to everyone in her employ. She looked between her legs at the faces of her staff, 'the help' as her parents had called them, and at this moment she was a servant to all of them, the lowest of the low, a queen humiliating herself for no gain apart from the gorgeous feeling of letting go of all pride and refinement to become a lowly sex object. After some further salacious dancing the music ground to a stop and Beatrix once again stood out to address the crowd.</p>
<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen, her majesty's tits!" she boomed to roaring applause, Melissa stood next to her not daring to move, "now of course the queen cares deeply for our commitment to our jobs, so much so she has offered to serve us drinks for the rest of the night, isn't that right your majesty?" Melissa could only just about bring herself to nod. "Of course a lot of you would have a lot to say to the queen if she were not serving drinks, but we cannot let her waver in her duties, so around the tables I have distributed quills in a variety of colours. If you have something to say to the queen, simply write it on her body as she goes about serving the party."</p>
<p>By the end of the night the queen was exhausted, she had spent all evening fetching drinks, calling her servants "sir," "master," and "mistress." At one point in the night she was called over to a conversation and was forced to apologise for being "a worthless cock whore," and "a filthy degenerate worse than pig shit." She was smeared with food, had drink thrown in her face, and was spanked and squeezed more times than she could count, all the while conscious of the scratching of quill over her delicate skin. As the party dried up and the guests departed, Beatrix fetched Melissa and took her back to her room.</p>
<p>"Now I understand that you will want to spend the night pleasuring yourself, however at first I thought it would be important to make use of the full length mirror in your bedroom." Beatrix guided the queen in front of her mirror so she could see the sight in front of her. She had the word "whore" written in big letters on the forehead of the mask. Her body was a mess of waste and words, every word she read on her delicate skin served to increase her arousal, highlights included:</p>
<p>"Queen Slut" on her chest.</p>
<p>"Please pinch my nipples" written above each nipple.</p>
<p>"The people's slave" written just above her pussy.</p>
<p>"I want a cock in all my holes at all times" written across the top of her back.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"Please put a horse cock in my ass" written on the small of her back.</p>
<p>"I'm worse than pigs but still fuck them." written on her butt cheeks.</p>
<p>Melissa could have spent hours drinking in the humiliation and pleasuring herself to the sight before her, however Beatrix decided to drag her away from the mirror.</p>
<p>"Sorry whore, this room is the queen's room, and where do you sleep?" asked Beatrix</p>
<p>"The kennels mistress." replied Melissa, automatically reaching for the leash, attaching it to her neck and handing it to Beatrix.</p>
<p>Beatrix lead Melissa to the kennels and locked her in, Melissa immediately curled into a ball, shivering with joy.</p>
<p>"So queen slut, before I leave you to yourself for the rest of the night I have 2 things to tell you, firstly, for the next week you are forbidden to bathe, you are to wear that body writing as a mark of honour." Melissa was humming, she couldn't wait for every time she would catch herself in the mirror over the next week. "And secondly the servants have an after party for your birthday in 2 months' time, at that party you will do the same again only without the mask."</p>
<p>Chapter 5: No longer innocent</p>
<p>Queen Melissa was having the best month of her life, every morning she woke in the kennels to the shining face of Beatrix, who had been working hard to make sure she was entertained.</p>
<p>"Good morning bitch, time to go play queen again!" Beatrix handed her today's outfit, one of the slinkier royal dresses, usually reserved for cocktail parties, she was also handed back her crown.</p>
<p>In the middle of a sexual awakening it is difficult to concentrate on one's day job, so it was with the queen who began waving through whatever her advisors thought was best, only perking up when Beatrix had suggestions. She was pleased to hear the last agenda item of the day, arrangements for the coronation day festival. It had been 3 years to the day since she was crowned and a big party needed to be organised to celebrate.</p>
<p>"If your majesty pleases, as head of the royal household I have plenty of experience organising royal events, if you give me the power of royal prerogative I can organise a party and ensure that there are surprises for you." Beatrix had a wicked grin on her face that told the queen she was planning something big, it was all she could do to stop her hand from sliding down her dress at the thought, she knew how Beatrix's party's turned out.</p>
<p>"Good idea, I love surprises! In organising this event Beatrix will have access to any and all support that can be sent her way." she signed documents to that effect and the advisors agreed that Beatrix would be best after how much they enjoyed the pre-coronation party.</p>
<p>The time passed quickly and on the day of the coronation party Beatrix woke the queen again, the queen had spent this week sleeping in her bedchambers with only minor tasks, this worried her immensely.</p>
<p>"Time for your coronation day surprise!"</p>
<p>"The party is not for another couple of hours, it's still dark outside."</p>
<p>"Oh yes, but we have to get you ready" Beatrix gleefully yelled while getting the queen out of bed. Melissa was not allowed to bathe and dressed in common rags so nobody in the town would recognise her. Beatrix led her into the city, through the winding roads and into the city dungeons through the back entrance. The dungeons were empty from their point of arrival. She was lead lower and lower until she came to a corridor full of rooms with locked doors, the wailing on the other sides of the doors demonstrating that these were holding cells.</p>
<p>Beatrix took the queen into an empty cell and before the queen could react she was chained to the wall, her peasant's rags ripped off in a single sweeping motion leaving her completely bare.</p>
<p>Once she was tied up Beatrix triumphantly held up a poster listing the day's activities. Deliberately drawing the queen's eye to the main event:</p>
<p>Parade of shame!</p>
<p>To demonstrate the shamefulness of a life of crime, 10 criminals will be lead through the streets in chains, the only covering being the hemp bags placed over their heads.</p>
<p>"Guess who's going to be a criminal today?" Beatrix beamed.</p>
<p>The panic was clear on the queen's face, she had not signed up to be paraded through the streets naked.</p>
<p>"You can't do this, everyone will know it's me" she pleaded.</p>
<p>"No they won't you will be among 9 other prisoners, 5 male and 4 female, you will have a hemp bag on your head from now until I come to collect you after we're done, trust me I have planned this to the letter. I will be overseeing every stage to make sure you are safe and then I will watch your naked body walk the streets of the kingdom you rule."</p>
<p>The queen went to raise another objection but was silenced by the sound of clanging coming from the entrance to the dungeon, the guards had arrived and it was too late to back out. Beatrix shoved the hemp sack over Melissa's face and pulled the tie cord to affix the bag in place. She then left the cell and left Melissa to darkness and dread.</p>
<p>Melissa was locked in place for what seemed like hours shivering and picturing the crowds of people who would see her naked today, none of them aware that she is the queen. She started to feel that familiar tingle but with her hands chained there was nothing she could do about it.</p>
<p>After what seemed like an eternity the door opened, through the sack Melissa could not see much but could make out a huge burly guard, he attached a collar with a chain on it that choked when pulled, took down her hands and chained them behind her back, he then tugged hard on her collar forcing her to join the queue of naked bodies. Each person in the procession had their hands chained behind their back and attached to the collar of the person behind them, meaning that only 1 guard was needed to pull this humiliation train around the city. Melissa was placed near the middle, and attached to her fellow prisoners.</p>
<p>"Alright everyone, ready to meet your adoring public", the guard sneered and Melissa was overcome with emotion as the front doors opened, light filled the room and the sound of cheers grew louder.</p>
<p>As Melissa felt the straw give way to cobblestone streets, it was all she could do to stay upright, she could feel every breeze and hear every jeer launched at her by the public. Had her hands been free she would have crumpled into a ball and pleasured herself right there and then. The guards were struggling to hold back the crowd and every so often an errant slap would land on her ass or breasts.</p>
<p>Suddenly without warning Melissa felt something soft and squidgy explode into her side, a repugnant smell filled the air and she had no idea what was happening until she heard a voice from the crowd shouting.</p>
<p>"Rotten fruit and veg! Get your rotten fruit and veg! Show contempt for the criminals with rotten apples, tomatoes, berries! For a little bit extra I even have some rotten eggs!" as this voice got louder Melissa got pelted with more and more rotten produce, the stench got worse and worse, but it only served to heighten the mood. All Melissa could focus on was how nobody knew that their queen had been reduced to the status of a petty criminal, punished and humiliated in the streets.</p>
<p>All at once there were screams from the audience, Melissa could hear sounds of fighting in the distance and suddenly the chain was yanked in the opposite direction, forcing the prisoners to sharply turn. Melissa collided with the male prisoner behind her and briefly felt his member in her hands, she stored that memory for later and took to running to keep up with the other prisoners as they were dragged back to the cells.</p>
<p>Melissa was once again chained to the cold dungeon wall, shivering with cold (among other things). It was not long before she heard Beatrix's voice, having a heated argument with the guard.</p>
<p>"While the queen is indisposed I have prerogative powers."</p>
<p>"I've seen that fancy document, you only have those powers over the events of the festival, you have no right to tell me what to do with my prisoners." Yelled a guard, this was bad, clearly events were out of Beatrix's control. Beatrix attempted to raise further objections but the guard decided to ignore her and turned to talk to the prisoners.</p>
<p>"Alright you horrible bunch, we were going to have a simple walk, but one of you had a bunch of your bandit chums try to free you from justice. Does anyone want to own up to being a member of a bandit gang?" the silence lingered in the air for an uncomfortable amount of time. "Nobody wants to own up, great, that's just what I wanted to hear. You see some of your buddies got away, we think they are still planning on freeing one of you so we are laying a trap to catch them and to discover which of you has bandit affiliations. You guys will now be doing the parade of shame one at a time, with no sacks over your head so your bandit friends can easily identify you."</p>
<p>The terror hit Melissa like a truck, she was about to be exposed and Beatrix was in no position to bail her out. How would the guards react to discovering that their queen enjoyed being paraded around the city naked?</p>
<p>"Let's start with the recent arrivals, get me the file on the woman in cell 6, you can see she still has remnants of being well groomed, nice trimmed bush down there as well." Melissa's stomach felt like she has swallowed a brick whole, she knew they were talking about her, this was going to be the moment it all came crashing down.</p>
<p>"File says she's a Jane Doe. Came in recently on a charge of impersonating the queen." if Melissa had been free she would have kissed Beatrix, clearly she had prepared the paperwork so if Melissa was discovered she could try and claim she was a lookalike. She was not out of the woods yet but it gave her a glimmer of hope. She was so caught up in this thought that she couldn't help but shriek when suddenly her hood was removed and she was face to face with a large brutish man looking up and down her body with lust.</p>
<p>"You know she does look just like the queen, bit younger and not as busty but I still would." The guard commented running his finger up and down Melissa's body.</p>
<p>"Well then we have a problem" interjected Beatrix. "This party is meant to be celebrating our revered queen, how do you think she would feel about you humiliating a queen doppelganger in the streets? Not only would it be highly disrespectful, she could charge you with treason as it could be argued that you are trying to lessen the public's respect and deference to the queen." Melissa made a mental note to increase Beatrix's salary. The guard looked disappointed, although this didn't stop him from continuing to grope and caress the helpless Melissa. As he stared at the body, the guard's inner sadist had an idea.</p>
<p>"In which case we should take steps so the prisoner no longer looks like the queen, it would mean we could parade her through the streets and she won't be able to impersonate her majesty any longer." Melissa went stiff.</p>
<p>"What do you have in mind?" Asked Beatrix.</p>
<p>"I say we shave her head and eyebrows, leave her as a naked little cue ball." Melissa pleaded at Beatrix with her eyes and her stomach dropped further when she saw a smirk roll across Beatrix's face. In a soft voice that could cut through steel Beatrix said:</p>
<p>"Good idea."</p>
<p>All coloured drained from the queen, it was all she could do to stare in disbelief at Beatrix as she was dragged off to a processing room. Her whole body was white as a sheet as they strapped her into a chair and leaned over her with scissors. Melissa didn't even realise it was really happening until she saw the first clump of hair fall down her face and onto the floor.</p>
<p>Melissa cried the entire time they were shaving her, she knew deep down that she had done this to herself, that the contract she had with Beatrix made events like this inevitable. Eventually she was given a hand mirror and the guards watched on in sadistic pleasure as Melissa looked at her bald head.</p>
<p>Using the hand mirror Melissa looked herself up and down, without her long luxurious hair she was now reduced to less than human, nobody looked upon her with love or care, she was now just an object of lust, tits and a pussy with some human bits attached. As she was lead back to the front door of the dungeons she heard the guards and prisoners jeering at her, her deepest desire at that point was for all the prison doors to open and for all the horny prisoners to go wild have their way with her.</p>
<p>In front of the front door, Melissa's hands were once again tied behind her back, Melissa then noticed that the guard did not have a collar, instead he was bringing over a far more slender chain that split into 3 chains part way down each with a small clip on the end. Melissa felt explosions of pain and pleasure as 2 of the clips were firmly attached to her nipples, then the guard knelt down and attached the third chain directly to the queen's clitoris. Melissa fell to her knees, shaking with pleasure, she was certain she had left a damp spot on the floor as the guard tugged her to her feet and led her out the front door.</p>
<p>The sun shone brightly in Melissa's eyes, before she had the hemp sack over her head to shield her from the reality of her situation, but now she didn't even have hair to cover her eyes. She saw the crowds swell with cheers and taunts. She watched as beggars and pig farmers swore and jeered at the queen now reduced to less than human. Some members of the crowd openly masturbated and the queen responded by slowing her pace and making sure she let out a long sensual groan when the guard pulled her forward. Every pace she was a sex object, she was free to swim in a cloud of depravity and humiliation as she has never done before.</p>
<p>Once again people started pelting her with rotten fruit and eggs, one member of the crowd had even gone home to fetch her bin, which she upended on the queen showering her with a week's worth of filth. Without her hair every rotten squelch that landed on her slowly trickled down her head and she felt every second of it.</p>
<p>The rest of the walk was a blur, the queen's head was swimming when she was chained back to the wall of a cell and she could not tell how long had passed before Beatrix arrived with a royal pardon in order to get her home.</p>
<p>When Melissa and Beatrix arrived back at the castle Melissa said nothing, even though it was early afternoon and the sun was in the sky, Melissa only had one thing on her mind. She walked to the dog kennels, climbed in and closed the door behind her.</p>
<p>Chapter 6: The Reintroduction</p>
<p>Beatrix had felt terrible about how the coronation day had turned out. She could not empathise with the queens depravity and mistook the queen's other worldly satisfaction for shock. The next day she was able to source some fake eyebrows and a wig so the queen could continue with her duties and no be recognised as object of abject humiliation from the coronation day celebrations. The queen accepted them and went about her duties.</p>
<p>For the next 2 weeks Beatrix did not play the role of mistress. She gave Melissa her space and allowed her privacy in her intimate hours. Beatrix noticed that the queen was receiving more packages than usual but thought no more about it.</p>
<p>The queen's birthday celebrations passed without incident and the servants after party had been organised. Beatrix played with the idea of using the party to get back in the rhythm of pushing the queens boundaries, however the queen spent a lot of time in her room these days and Beatrix didn't want to push her too far, even if technically the contract was still in effect.</p>
<p>The party started as a subdued affair, after last time people were a bit disappointed as Beatrix's heart was not in it and the quality showed. Beatrix went up on stage to check that it was laid out properly when she caught sight of a hand beckoning her off the side of the stage. She walked towards it and turned the corner to find Melissa, dressed in the exact slutty queen outfit she had worn at the last party, complete with mask. Beatrix's breath was taken away, she looked her queen up and down before allowing a big smile to grow on her face.</p>
<p>"Your majesty I..." Beatrix began.</p>
<p>"Mistress I believe my title is Slut Queen." interjected Melissa. "I also believe it is customary to be announced before one strips on stage."</p>
<p>Beatrix said nothing, she turned and walked up to the stage to grab everyone's attention.</p>
<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen, once again thank you for all your hard work over the last couple of weeks, as you can see we have more drink and more great food than the last party, but don't you guys agree there's something missing?" Beatrix paused to allow the murmur of agreement to circulate. "Well after how you treated her last time I had a hard time convincing her majesty to make another appearance, but I promised her that this time you wouldn't hold back, so here she is, her majesty, Queen Melissa!"</p>
<p>The band had not been prepped for this and instead went into the same routine as last time, slowly playing the national anthem before transitioning into a sexier number. Melissa began a dance that had clearly been prepared and practiced, it was far less rushed and far more sensual than before, as she wiggled out of her dress and stood in her bikini and suspenders, Beatrix noticed that there were 2 strange lumps by her nipples, her curiosity was satisfied rather quickly when Melissa tore off the Bikini top to reveal that some time recently she had gotten her nipples pierced and there were currently two metal hoops looped through them. She copied the move from her last strip, where she faced the crowd and pulled down her knickers, bending over so they could see all her intimate areas. Beatrix noticed that this time she was completely shaved down below.</p>
<p>As her dance came to an end Melissa called for quiet so she could speak.</p>
<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen, thanks for having me back, I really enjoyed myself last time and I was wracking my brain about what I could do to be more naked for you this time, so here it goes."</p>
<p>For Beatrix everything went into slow motion, as the queen raised her hands up to her neck, hesitated as her hands shook, and then in one smooth and fast motion pulled the mask upwards. The whole staff body gasped as the mask was on the floor and queen Melissa was stood in front of all her staff naked, she was wearing a wig and fake eyebrows to make sure that everyone there recognised her, there was mixture of shouts and screams before the crowd fell deeply silent, unable to process what was happening in front of them.</p>
<p>"Masters and Mistresses I have an announcement, I wish to start a new tradition, you see I like being degraded, I am your queen but I am also a huge pervert. So I propose a new tradition, starting tonight, the week following my birthday will be humiliation week. I will not book any appointments or leave the castle grounds, instead I will be naked the entire time and have only one job which is to serve you, any order you give me I will obey. For 51 weeks of the year I will be your queen, but for 1 week I will be your slave."</p>
<p>"Why just a week!" came a yell from the crowd.</p>
<p>"I think it is much more exciting for it to be a special occasion. I think you would get bored of me if I was always a degraded whore." explained Melissa.</p>
<p>Whilst everyone else broke into murmurs and discussion the queen walked to the back of the stage and picked up a bag she had placed there earlier. Firstly she took out a nose ring and threaded it through her newly pierced septum she then hooked a lead through the ring so anyone could lead her by the nose. Next she picked up a specially modified tray, the tray balanced against her waist and had 2 chains that rose up and connected to her pierced nipples so the weight of the tray hung on her breasts, she even had two bottles of mead that she placed on the tray, moaning with delight. Finally she picked out a pair of handcuffs, but she didn't put them on just yet, instead she handed the keys to Beatrix and walked back out to the front of the stage.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"I know a lot of you would struggle to stop thinking of me as your queen, so I recently had something drastic done so you will stop thinking of me as a human and start thinking of me a sex object". She peeled off her wig and eyebrows, revealing a finely shaved head underneath, Beatrix could tell that she had re-shaved her head and eyebrows in preparations for tonight. The queen locked the handcuffs behind her and walked over to Beatrix.</p>
<p>"Could Mistress please lead me to the crowd? This horny slut bitch is eager to serve all her new masters and mistresses."</p>
<p>Beatrix took ahold of the lead and gave it a yank, pulling the queen forward as the queen began to moan with pleasure. Beatrix was able to overcome her shock and fall back into the role of the Queen's dominatrix.</p>
<p>"Excuse me queen bitch, why are you walking on your hind legs?" Beatrix asked in a severe voice loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Mistress." Announced Melissa, getting onto all fours.</p>
<p>"Very good!" Grinned Beatrix, "how is everyone supposed to know your a depraved humiliation whore if you walk upright like a human?"</p>
<p>The servants closed in around the queen, having seen how Beatrix was acting the dam of disbelief had been broken and now every member of staff was thinking through the depraved things they could do to their queen, and they had a whole week to do it.</p>
<p>Melissa grinned.</p>
