<p>There's hardly any graphic sex here, so if that's your cuppa you should probably read something else. I'm not opposed to erotic scenes, mind you, I just can't write them worth a tinker's damn.</p>
<p>I know I could ask for help, but my first two experiences asking established authors for editing guidance were enormously frustrating. The first never answered and a year later the second agreed, but after two months of no further response I had to face reality—it wasn't going to happen. I feared I had succumbed to a malady once diagnosed by an aristocratic young lady from Nashville: gettin' above my raisin's.</p>
<p>Six months later, with no little trepidation I asked a third time for editorial assistance—not specifically in writing sex scenes, just a plain old story edit. To my great relief (and delight), this time my concerns proved to be misplaced; not only was the person agreeable, she was downright enthusiastic. It would be churlish, therefore, for me to neglect acknowledging my debt. Her passion, her knowledge and experience, her often gentle but always insistent guiding hand(s), all these and more enabled me to eliminate multifarious errors.</p>
<p>Her final words to me were "No turd polishing!"— whatever sparks of competence you might see are due to the skilled and caring massages of my editor, Pauline French. But I've never been able to let well enough alone; all remaining errors are solely my responsibility. I hope the experience was as good for her as it was for me. Merci mille fois, Mme. French.</p>
<p>SHE ISN'T REALLY going to put that in her—holy shit! She did!</p>
<p>That was my first reaction seeing a cam girl trying to inspire her watchers to give money ( in the form of "tips") to encourage even more raunchy behavior. For those of you free of depravity and consequently unfamiliar with this particular corner of the interweb, cam girls are women who set up a webcam and do whatever they think will get men to give them money. The most common activity is masturbating until they reach a (usually faked) orgasm.</p>
<p>The money comes in the form of "tokens" that anyone can buy with a credit card for a dime apiece. Then they log in to the cam girl's "room"—usually a bedroom—and watch (occasionally also to listen; some girls talk, some don't). They can tip her as many tokens as often as they like, but it isn't required simply to watch. The rooms also include a chat window, and most cam girls encourage chatting because it seems to encourage tipping. She gets a nickel for each tip, the website keeps the other nickel.</p>
<p>It's a sweet business for the website, not so sweet for most of the girls. Well, "models" might be more accurate than "girls" because there are rooms for women, men, transgendered of every stripe, and couples—again, of all imaginable combinations—but most are females, known generically as cam girls. The "girls" range in age from 18 (the minimum) to the occasional septuagenarian (no, not kidding), all sizes (hardbodies to morbidly obese), and all colors. The average age appears to be mid-to-late twenties.</p>
<p>Thousands of women are doing this, on hundreds of websites. Because the websites make most of their money by raking their half of the tips, many let you hang out in a room and watch the goings-on without paying anything up front. Even though you can watch some pretty nasty stuff for free, most girls won't let you chat unless you tip; chatting makes it seem interactive, even personal, and is a big part of the appeal.</p>
<p>After the novelty wore off—believe it or not, pretty soon tits and asses and pussies with various dildos, vibrators, mechanical female penetration devices, and vegetables of all sizes, shapes, and colors, soon lose their power to arouse—I stopped trying to find the nastiest show and just started cruising out of curiosity.</p>
<p>So why is a 29-year-old high school math and computer programming teacher in Hollister, California, leering at naked women who masturbate for money? It could be a long story, but it's an embarrassing one so I'll try to keep it short.</p>
<p>MY FIRST JOB out of college was teaching math in Gustine, a small farm town on the west edge of California's central valley about 100 miles south of Sacramento. Five years later I finally got tired of Gustine and took a teaching job in Hollister, a bigger farm town 50 miles closer to the ocean that was morphing into a bedroom community for Silicon Valley. Why would anybody want to commute that far? Take a look at the absurd Bay Area housing prices (I mean, come on! Somebody paid $2.1 million to scrape off a 970-square-foot 2br 1ba that listed for $1.4M? In San José?).</p>
<p>Confession time: I didn't really get tired of Gustine, I got divorced of Gustine. From the horror stories I've heard my divorce was relatively painless, but it sure hurt at the time. When I asked Anne to marry me, I thought we loved each other and were going to start making babies Real Soon Now. Turned out that we both loved Anne and we both liked sex, but we didn't last until Real Soon Now.</p>
<p>Early one May morning of our third year in Gustine, she sat me down at the kitchen table before she left for work in Merced, and with no preamble explained that she and another CPA at her company were leaving the next morning to start their own accountancy. They were going in to work today just to get their final paychecks. They'd signed a lease on office space in Fremont, a slurb just across the bay from Palo Alto, and already had their business license; they'd even signed a couple of clients.</p>
<p>It seems they were more than business partners: they also signed an apartment lease. "Jack and I discovered that we each have a strong entrepreneurial spirit, and there isn't much opportunity in the Boredom Capital of California. We aren't involved romantically, we just share many of the same values and goals." My bullshit meter bounced off the peg and I snorted, but she just gave me a dirty look and plowed on.</p>
<p>"We're sharing the apartment for now because rent's so high in the Bay Area. That'll probably change as soon as our income allows." Yeah, right after the Bears beat the Pats again in the Super Bowl. She said it as if she were describing a routine tax-reduction plan to a client. I was surprised she hadn't emailed it to me in a spreadsheet or gave a PowerPoint presentation.</p>
<p>"Are you listening to what you're saying, Anne?" I did a lousy job of hiding my bitterness. "You sound like you're telling me you tossed out a torn T-shirt, but you're actually telling me that you've tossed out me. What the hell's going on?" She stared at me for a couple of seconds as if she didn't understand my words, then continued as if I hadn't said anything.</p>
<p>"Union City isn't exactly exciting, but it's what we can afford right now and it gets us closer to Silicon Valley. I'm sorry, Ben, but this is best for us." She didn't look or sound very sorry, didn't define "us", and either didn't know or didn't care that she'd just reached in, yanked out my heart, and used it to beat my ego to death.</p>
<p>"There's no need to drag this out. Jack's brother is a lawyer in Sacramento and we told him to make it as fair as possible. I know you're never going to make big bucks, so I don't want to take any more than I'm entitled to; less, in fact." She pushed a sheaf of papers from her briefcase across the table. "I've already signed them.</p>
<p>"You keep the house and your teacher's retirement and car. I only want half our joint checking and investment accounts and my car. You shouldn't sign without getting an attorney to look it over. Why don't you call Tim and see if he can do it today? That way we can tie up most of the loose ends before Jack and I leave tomorrow." I was still trying to absorb her announcement that she was leaving, but she was looking at her watch. It was obvious she'd long since unhooked emotionally from me and was thinking down the road.</p>
<p>She stood, put the papers in her briefcase, grabbed her laptop, patted the back of my hand, and headed for the door. Just as she started to turn the doorknob, she delivered her parting line without turning around. "It's too bad it had to end this way, Ben, but better now than a few years down the road. We're both young enough to get on with our lives and achieve our goals."</p>
<p>Easy for her to say. Up until a few minutes ago, I thought we had shared goals, like raising a family and growing old together. I didn't have an alternative future planned. She did.</p>
<p>"What happened to the girl I married, Anne? The girl who promised to love me in good times and bad, forsaking all others? What happened to our plans to start a family?" I tried as hard as I could to sound calm and cool, but failed miserably. I looked down at the papers so she couldn't see my face, but she never turned around. She didn't respond for a minute or so, a long time to stand with your back to someone, gripping a doorknob with a briefcase in your other hand. When she did, she didn't sound like she was pitching a business plan, she sounded...unsure? Hesitant? I couldn't tell any more.</p>
<p>"We shouldn't have married, Ben. We were...too young, just two months out of college. We didn't know what life was all about, let alone marriage. Please don't make this any more difficult than it already is." Difficult? For whom? I felt like jumping up and shouting that she had no fucking idea what difficult feels like.</p>
<p>"We should have known then that we had different wants. I don't mean I want a big house or a fancy car or designer clothes, those are just things. But I want to matter, I want the chance to show what I can achieve even if it means I'll fail. I can't do that as just another CPA in Merced." Her shoulders sagged, she took a deep breath, but still didn't turn around.</p>
<p>"You're content with life here. I'm not." I thought I heard her voice break just a little on those last two words, but she opened the door and walked out, closing it quietly.</p>
<p>Tim Elliott was the lawyer who advised us when we bought the house a few years ago; we'd become pretty good friends with him and his wife. He worked me in during my lunch hour, read through the proposed settlement, and advised me to sign it.</p>
<p>"She's being more than fair, Ben, although I doubt that she's giving up much equity by letting you keep the house. There's no point in contesting, unless you want to hold out for counseling and think you've got a chance to change her mind." I told him I didn't think there was any chance, in fact I wasn't even sure that I wanted to change her mind. I signed.</p>
<p>"What the hell happened? I know she wasn't especially warm and fuzzy, but this just seems sort of...well, cold. Even for her." He and his wife had never been overly fond of Anne.</p>
<p>"Beats the shit out of me. I guess she just wanted more than being married to a high school teacher in Gustine and caught the first available flight out."</p>
<p>I didn't feel that calm or cynical, of course, but I had no idea what had gone wrong. Later, when I thought back over the last couple of years, hindsight showed me some signs of problems—with her, with our marriage—but I didn't see them at the time. Not sure I could have done anything about it even if I had. We simply had different goals in life.</p>
<p>I called Anne using Tim's desk phone and told her I'd signed; she said to leave the papers with Tim and she'd pick them up later that afternoon, then hung up without saying goodbye. Sayonara, loser. No, she didn't say that, but she might as well have. I stared at the phone for a moment, then hung up, thanked Tim, and drove back to school. So much for our marriage. I didn't speak with Anne again for almost five years, and then only to agree to a deposition if her divorce lawyer needed one (she and Jack got married about a year after the divorce; apparently it didn't take). Happily, he didn't need the deposition—some scabs are better left unpicked.</p>
<p>The next few weeks were rough. Even though she insisted that she left for a career, not wild sex with some smooth-talking guy named Jack, Anne had hammered my ego. My heart was a bit more complicated: word quickly got around, and I was embarrassed that others knew she had left me. I finally realized although I felt like I should be mourning the loss of my wife, I really wasn't, I just regretted the loss of face and regular sex.</p>
<p>I had to admit that Anne was right, we shouldn't have gotten married. Not because we were too young (we were both 23), but because we hadn't really known each other. Yeah, she was pretty and I wasn't ugly, but we didn't share many interests or, as it turned out, values. We enjoyed sex with each other a lot—we agreed to be exclusive more than a year before our wedding—and I guess we figured that since we talked about things like how long couples should wait before having children, marriage was the logical next step.</p>
<p>I DECIDED I DIDN'T want to stay in Gustine, and it didn't take long to find another job for the next school year. I listed the house as soon as I got the job offer, asking only a few thousand over the appraised value. I drove to San Benito STEM Academy (Go Condors!), a new charter school in Hollister, and signed their employment contract.</p>
<p>The house sold within a week, but because we'd only owned it a few years and made the minimum down payment, I came away with less than $5000 at the close; I was tempted to spite Anne by giving her half even though I didn't have to, but I could use the money so I ignored the temptation. I packed my stuff in a U-Haul trailer and joined California's vast army of apartment dwellers.</p>
<p>I discovered that although I wasn't mourning the loss of Anne, I had a real problem with trust. I dated a few women, including an English teacher from San Benito High, a nurse from Hazel Hawkins Hospital, and a bartender from South Carolina, but each time it was pretty obvious that there wasn't any chemistry and there wasn't going to be any. They weren't interested in a ho*okup and I wasn't interested in a relationship, so I decided that dating, at least for a while, was a waste of time and money.</p>
<p>Being of sound mind and body and possessed of decent broadband access to the web, I turned to the obvious alternative: online porn. It didn't take long to discover how boring it can get to watch gorgeous women with long hair, perfect makeup, enormous enhanced mammaries, and bald pussies, being penetrated in various orifices by one or more bearded and/or tattooed blokes with enormous schlongs.</p>
<p>Boredom led me to poking around (so to speak) in the aforementioned cam rooms. I was just about to give it up and resurrect my WoW Frost DK, when a thumbnail on a splash page attracted my attention and I clicked on it.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell if the cam girl was pretty because, like a few others, she kept her face out of camera range. She wasn't naked, either, she had on what looked like a plain white spaghetti-strap camisole over a pair of fairly generous tatas. But she had rolled her bikini panties down almost to her slit, exposing an unruly thatch of black pubes—pretty uncommon in this fantasy world of mature women trying to look like pre-pubescent girls by shaving or waxing every errant hair south of their nose.</p>
<p>Unperforated (interesting name) wasn't talking, just typing responses to comments in the chat window. I watched for a while, and was surprised to see that she wasn't shilling for tips with dirty talk. She limited her responses to brief, encouraging comments like "That sounds nice, detro" in response to a user named detroit_stud69 who said he'd like to lick her whole body, or "Thanks iluv. muah muah" and an emoji of a smiley face with giant red lips when some guy—I assumed that most of them were guys—who called himself iluvclits tipped 10 tokens.</p>
<p>Like most cam girls, she listed goals to be reached when a certain number of tips accumulated. Goals mostly involved taking off additional items of clothing or various moderately titillating actions. Unlike most cam girls, however, none of her goals involved masturbation, insertion of dildos or other toys, anal penetration, kinky fetishes, or orgasms. I watched for a few minutes, and was struck by how she almost came across as a sweet girl next door. Even when the comments were blatantly sexual, she kept her responses PG-13; she simply ignored the horndogs who made really vulgar comments. Her demeanor kept the overall tone of the room far less raunchy than most of the others.</p>
<p>I was tired of the usual cam girls but curious about this one. I wanted to make it easy to find her again, so before checking out of her room I clicked the tab labeled FOLLOW, and was informed that in order to follow I had to register. All it required was an email address, no credit card or telephone number, and a screen name. I pondered for a while before dubbing myself LeibnizFTW (fig you, Newton), entered one of several anonymous email address I had, then clicked FOLLOW and left.</p>
<p>I looked in on her two or three times in the next week. Her (comparatively) prudent performance wasn't a fluke—she consistently declined to pander. Oh, she wasn't quite the girl next door. Whether clothed or not, every once in a while she'd run her fingers through her untamed pubes, but she seemed to be doing it almost absent-mindedly, not salaciously. Sometimes through the parted pubes I thought I caught a glimpse of a tattoo, but I couldn't make out what it was.</p>
<p>When she got enough tips she shed her camisole and panties. Her ample breasts proved to be the stuff of classic statuary: not huge or perfectly round artifacts of a plastic surgeon's work, but well-proportioned to her body. The aureoles were a bit larger than a quarter—35 or 40 cents worth—and more brown than pink. Her prominent nipples were wrinkled and standing proud, whether due to a chilly room or arousal wasn't clear.</p>
<p>She had a bit of a tummy instead of sculptured abs, her hips were generous (a grandmother might describe them as "wonderful for having babies"), her thighs a bit thicker than some might consider ideal. This woman didn't try to project an image of unattainable perfection or unbridled lust, she simply looked real.</p>
<p>Her final goal involved "pussy play"—she would spread her labia and, using just a fingertip, toy with her vagina or clitoris until a creamy excretion appeared. She would pat the pad of her index finger on it, then slowly draw up a string to demonstrate how thick it was. No masturbation, no moaning or spasms to simulate an orgasm, just a slow, deliberate exposition and teasing of her naughty bits and apparently consequential secretion.</p>
<p>These final titillations often inspired a shower of comments; unlike most other models, however, hers were more along the lines of that was beautiful or wow!! I love you!!! rather than the so fukin hot! or can i cum all over ur cunt, too common in other rooms. After four or five minutes of her purported orgasmic display, she would usually excuse herself with "Bathroom break," return a couple of minutes later back in her camisole and bikini panties, and restart the goal sequence.</p>
<p>The downside to her restrained performance was that she didn't attract a very large audience or very many tips. Her room count was seldom over 200; the more popular cam girls often counted several thousand, sometimes more than 10,000—on rare occasions even over 20,000—and correspondingly more frequent (and usually larger) tips.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks after I discovered Unperforated, she became part of my daily routine. I'd get to my apartment around 5:30 , take care of any schoolwork (writing quizzes or dreaming up programming challenges or grading papers), then prepare my gourmet dinner (usually soup, chili, canned stew, or pizza). After surfing the net for a while, it was time to check in with Unperforated. She would never show her face or reveal where she lived. When asked what she did for a living, she replied that camming was her only source of income. At a nickel a tip I couldn't see how she could be supporting herself. After several visits, I figured the answer had to be something called a private show.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>For 18 tokens a minute with a minimum of 10 minutes, a user could enjoy a private (one-on-one) show with Unperforated. At a nickel a tip that meant she made a huge $9, although some of her private shows seemed to run quite a bit longer. She disappeared from everyone else's screen for the duration; I could only imagine what she did to encourage these more exclusive shows. When she left for a private show most people would drift out of her room, so she'd have to build up the audience all over again. Some cam girls charged as much as 150 tokens a minute for their private show, or sold tickets for group shows at 100 to 333 tokens a pop; successful cam girls reportedly made $100,000 or more a year, but Unperforated obviously fell far short of such riches.</p>
<p>One night I sat grading papers at the kitchen table with her room displayed on my laptop, and noticed three private shows in just under an hour (okay, so maybe I wasn't devoting full attention to the grading). By the end of the third (and longest) private show, I was one of only five left in her room. She had no restrictions on who could chat, so a little while later I typed "You have beautiful breasts." Not tits or boobs, as most of the others called them. She thanked me, calling me leib, and included a cute emoji of a kitty blowing a kiss. I was surprised at the surge of good feeling when she did that—a mild endorphin rush. No wonder cam girls encouraged chatting!</p>
<p>That was the first time I spent more than 10 or 15 minutes in her room. The next night I bought 100 tokens (yeah, had to give them my Visa number), tipped her five—Wow! She got a whole quarter!—and paid her another polite compliment in the private message each tip allows. Over the next week, I started staying in her room about an hour each night; I would tip her 5 and compliment her politely at least once each session. Each time she responded by thanking me and including some cute emoji. Her thanks started getting somewhat warmer.</p>
<p>One night after a month or so as she was absently stroking her pubes, I thought I saw something tattooed on the left side of her mons. I paid closer attention for a while, and finally made out OM; there seemed to be more, but I couldn't make it out (she had really thick pubes). Over the next week or so I saw it was HOM, and finally, about a week later, HOME. That's clever. She wouldn't want FIRST BASE or SECOND BASE tattooed where they could easily be seen, but hiding HOME plate was cute. And funny.</p>
<p>I chuckled about this when she fiddled again, then saw that there was one more letter. B? P? No, it was R. HOMER? That was puzzling. Was something on the other side of her mons? BART? No, that would be sick, he's just a kid. MARGE? Maybe she's bi? It was getting late, so I logged out went to bed. I was in that weird twilight zone just as you're falling sleep when random thoughts pop into your head and you're not sure what's real and what's a dream. I mused about a cam girl indelibly identifying her cooch as HOMER, then started to grin; maybe her last name's Chapman and she labeled Chapman's Homer—you know, On first looking into—</p>
<p>Holy shit! I sat up, wide awake. What if she was Marcella Chapman! That was so not funny. Then somehow I knew that's who she was.</p>
<p>HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR YEAR, typical horny guy. If I was from Mars, Marcella Minerva Chapman wasn't from Venus, she was from Proxima Centauri b—she was that far out of my league. Marcie was drop-dead gorgeous, got a brand-new Corvette for her 16th birthday, went through boyfriends like Mike Tyson went through sparring partners. I was in at least one class with her every semester all through high school in Grass Valley, memorized every oblate spheroid and hyperbolic paraboloid of her stellar body.</p>
<p>But Marcella Minerva Chapman had no more idea that Ben Day existed than she knew what the Avogadro Number was. Which I did know, of course—hell, I even knew why it wasn't called Avogadro's Number anymore—pretty well giving away our respective roles in those years of pedagogical desuetude known as high school: she was a social princess and I was the quintessential geek. (We learned that pithy phrase—pedagogical desuetude—from our counselor, Tony Harmon, who called himself our sex and drugs and rock-and-roll teacher.)</p>
<p>The most memorable—and demoralizing—experience of my high school years happened near the end of my senior prom. I'd call it "our" senior prom but that would imply some sort of link between Marcella Chapman and me beyond the simple fact that we were both there. I had to take a leak before I left, and as I came out of the rest room Marcella Minerva Chapman stomped up to me. She pushed me against the wall, plastered her pelvis against my crotch, grabbed my ass with both hands, plunked my uvula with her tongue like it was her own magic twanger, then fixed me with a fierce glare.</p>
<p>"You should have asked me to this dance, dipshit! Now I've got to give my cherry to Johnny Dickhead Keats." She held the glare for a few seconds, then reached under her prom dress, wriggled a bit, slapped her panties in my hand, then stormed off to her rest room. I stuffed her panties in my hip pocket—well, yeah, I might have sniffed them, just a bit, first—and stood there for a minute or so trying to figure out what the hell just happened.</p>
<p>I finally decided that it had either been a dare or she was just torturing me for the hell of it. I'd carried a torch for Marcie so long that it was a wonder I didn't have black lung disease from all the oily smoke I inhaled. It turned out that I had contented myself with fantasies not because she didn't know I existed, but because I just didn't fucking ask. Dipshit was the understatement of the year, if not the decade.</p>
<p>I left the prom with my date, and no, she wasn't my sister or my cousin, and yes, I got laid, and no, she didn't get pregnant, and yes, we fumbled around a lot but sort of enjoyed it, and no, we never went out again.</p>
<p>Marcie Chapman went on to Stanford for a BS in psychology, then Harvard for her MBA. I went to Diablo Valley Community College for general ed, transferred to Fresno State for a BS in math with a minor in computer science, then spent another Bulldog year getting my teaching certificate. She got a job at Google in Boston for something north of $90K doing some sort of market research; I got a job teaching high school math in Gustine for a lot less.</p>
<p>I was convinced the cam girl who called herself Unperforated was Marcie Chapman. I had to talk to her, to find out what happened, why wasn't she still with Google in Boston, why was she doing this since it was obvious she didn't want to do what other cam girls did to make big money. As usual, when I went into her room that night I tipped five and paid her another respectful, if somewhat obscure compliment: "I've never seen it, but I'm sure your face would launch far more ships than Helen's paltry thousand." I was pretty sure that most cam girls wouldn't have the faintest idea what I meant. Yeah, I know that's stereotyping, so sue me. Marcie Chapman would, though.</p>
<p>—i doubt that but ty</p>
<p>She punctuated her message of thanks with a GIF of a round yellow cartoon face gliding over to kiss another round yellow cartoon face that blushed furiously (think animated smiley faces), then quickly typed another reply.</p>
<p>—poor sailors didn't bring Trojans® lol</p>
<p>And another emoji: a yellow cartoon face with eyes closed demurely and a slightly askew halo. Bingo! She's riffing on Helen of Troy, gotta be Marcie. Now what? I wanted to talk with her, to let her know who I was, find out what the hell she was doing here, ask her if she had problems, offer to help—but I was pretty sure she'd kick me out if I just blurted that I knew who she was. I sure as hell didn't want her to kick me because I wouldn't be able to get back into her room for a month.</p>
<p>I needed a long, private talk with her, which meant buying a private show. At 18 tokens a minute and a 10-minute minimum I'd need at least 180, but I had hopes of getting her to spend even more time with me. I'd resolved that the ten bucks I spent for 100 tokens was the only money I'd spend on porn, but this was Marcie Chapman! That evening, I bought 500 tokens and didn't waste time on small talk.</p>
<p>—Good evening, beautiful young lady. How do I arrange a private show?</p>
<p>It turned out to be pretty easy. I paid my 180 tokens and shortly it was just the two of us.</p>
<p>—what do u wanna see leib? titty play, ass gape, wild orgasm?</p>
<p>She assumed that I was just another horndog, but had no reason to think otherwise.</p>
<p>—No, nothing like that. I'd just like to talk with you for a while.</p>
<p>She waited a bit before responding.</p>
<p>—bout what? trade drty jokes or tell me what u wanna do 2 me or what ur doing rite now?</p>
<p>Then a quick follow-up.</p>
<p>—i dont talk about me</p>
<p>The last thing in the world I wanted was to sext with Marcie Chapman. I wanted to tell her I always regretted missing my chance with her and wanted a second chance, but didn't know how to get there and figured I'd better go slow.</p>
<p>—I won't ask any personal questions, I promise. I know better than that.</p>
<p>—then what do u want? i dont do grlfrend</p>
<p>This wasn't going well. If I pissed her off, she'd kick me.</p>
<p>—No, no, I'm not looking for a girlfriend, just temporary companionship. That oughta be easy money for you.</p>
<p>She took her time responding. I needed to find a way to get through to her without making her mad. Or scaring her.</p>
<p>—ok mr easy money what do we talk about?</p>
<p>Oh shit! I hadn't thought this through. I couldn't think of anything innocuous to talk about. I was really afraid that I would screw it up and lose any chance of reconnecting with Marcie. I started off kind of babbling.</p>
<p>—Movies? NASCAR? Trivia questions?</p>
<p>No response. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I was running out of time—not the private time I paid almost $2 a minute for, but the time I had left to convince Marcie Chapman that I was someone she'd known most of her life, someone who cared for her. Time to change tactics.</p>
<p>—Wait! Before you decide I'm a total jerk, do you recognize my name? I've been coming to your room for over a month.</p>
<p>Again, she waited a moment to respond.</p>
<p>—lotsa guys come in here but ya i sort of remember u. so?</p>
<p>—Have I treated you with disrespect, made lewd or lascivious comments or suggestions or requests?</p>
<p>—dude i cant remember what guys say. this place gets pretty busy yanno.</p>
<p>—Come on, I always make it a point to be polite and respectful...well, maybe sometimes a bit appreciative of your...charms.</p>
<p>—...charms...right!</p>
<p>Whoa! She spoke pretty good sarcasm. I pictured her putting air quotes around charms.</p>
<p>—ok so ur not a dirtmouth. bfd thats a pretty lo bar. if ur such a boy scout what r u doing here?</p>
<p>That sounded like a flicker of interest. I needed to gently fan that flame.</p>
<p>—If I promise not to ask anything that could give away who you are or where you're from, would you promise not to kick me?" She replied immediately.</p>
<p>—r u serius? a blank chek? u xpect me 2 promise? i dont think u undrstnd camming. how old r u?</p>
<p>Well, that didn't work. Even though almost five minutes were left on the clock, I tipped my remaining tokens for another 19 minutes.</p>
<p>—Now there's 23 minutes left and I'm broke. You wouldn't kick a fella who just gave you his last nickel, would you?</p>
<p>I waited a few seconds. No response, so I babbled on, hoping to placate her.</p>
<p>—Please believe me, I'm not a psychopath, I'm not even a sociopath, or some drooling gameboy living in his mother's basement. I'm crushingly ordinary, a high school math teacher for God's sake! Divorced, no kids, afraid to trust again, lonely. That's all.</p>
<p>She waited so long I was afraid I had screwed the pooch. Just as I was about to type something whining and pathetic, she responded. No more chat box Valley Girl speak, it sounded like someone else.</p>
<p>—You do seem like a pretty nice guy, LeibnizFTW, but I'm not looking for Mr. Right, I'm looking for tips. This is my only job. I make money by giving guys something to whack off to. I don't do companionship. Take my advice, look somewhere else.</p>
<p>Talk about brutal honesty. I was losing her, time to swing for the fence. I typed as fast as I could to keep her from leaving.</p>
<p>—I;m nott a pretty bnice guy, i'm the di[shit who didn</p>
<p>—t invite ypu to teh prom 12 yearrs ago</p>
<p>—ive regreted it ecver since still do ebry day</p>
<p>When I saw how many mistakes I'd made, I slowed down for my last gasp.</p>
<p>—Would you give me another chance? Please?</p>
<p>I quit typing and waited. And waited. She turned the webcam so it showed a blank wall. My heart sank. Then, for the first time, I heard her speak.</p>
<p>"Ben?"</p>
<p>IT WAS THE FIRST time Unperforated had spoken on camera. I hadn't heard Marcie's voice since that prom night so many years ago. I think my heart skipped at least a full beat, I didn't realize I'd been holding my breath until I finally gasped for air.</p>
<p>"Oh God, why did you have to see me here?" The anguish in her voice nearly broke my heart. I quickly tried to reassure her.</p>
<p>—Don't be unhappy, Marcie, I'm happy no I'm overjoyed, I'm thrilled. Please please don't be sad. Be happy that we found each other."</p>
<p>I typed quick follow-ups, but made sure there were no mistakes before pressing SEND.</p>
<p>—I can't tell you how many times I've regretted being so clueless about you. I had no idea a girl like you would care anything about me.</p>
<p>—I'll tell you why I'm hanging out here if you'll tell me why you aren't still in Boston taking over Google.</p>
<p>—But please, please don't leave. I don't ever want to lose you again.</p>
<p>I could hear her crying. "Oh Ben, you're the last person I wanted to find me. You knew me before I turned into...this." I started typing while she was still talking, pressed ENTER just as soon as she finished, then kept typing.</p>
<p>—You haven't turned into anything.</p>
<p>—You're still Marcella Minerva Chapman, the girl of my dreams.</p>
<p>—Something bad must have happened to bring you here.</p>
<p>—Let me make that bad go away.</p>
<p>When she finally responded, her voice was flat, no more crying. "You can't. No one can."</p>
<p>She kept going before I had time to respond</p>
<p>"Ben, I can't stand the thought of you watching me. Give me your phone number and email address. I promise I'll get in touch with you if you'll promise to leave and never come back here again."</p>
<p>I was afraid to take the risk, but wanted her to trust me.</p>
<p>—Marcie, I'm afraid to take the chance of losing you again.</p>
<p>I was typing my next line when she turned the camera up to show her face, eyes glittering with tears. She was even prettier than I remembered, she was beautiful.</p>
<p>"You can trust me, Ben, I promise. I think I want that second chance, too."</p>
<p>Now my eyes filled with tears. I gave her my phone and email address, told her she was beautiful, then said goodbye.</p>
<p>"Before you go, Ben, how did you recognize me?"</p>
<p>—Your tat. Not when I first saw it, but later that night, after I went to bed. Might even have dreamed it. Chapman's Homer, indeed!</p>
<p>"My analyst, if I had an analyst, would probably say I was trying to get caught, that I wanted somebody to guess what it meant and who I was. But what would have been the odds that it'd be you?"</p>
<p>—Since we're obviously meant to be together, I'd say they couldn't have been better.</p>
<p>She laughed, just a little one, but it still lit up her face. "Pity you weren't such a smooth talker back then." The smile faded. "Now go, please. I promise I'll be in touch."</p>
<p>I left her room and logged off the cam site, hoping that I'd never return.</p>
<p>By the evening of the third day I was a wreck. Marcie hadn't called or emailed, and I was afraid she might have changed her online name or even switched to a different website, that I'd never find her again. I started to wish I'd never figured out that Unperforated was Marcie.</p>
<p>Then she called. Once again God was in his heaven and all was right with the world.</p>
<p>But my good spirits faded when I tried to arrange a meeting—she said she couldn't bear to face me. She wouldn't even give me her email or phone number, but agreed not to hang up. After I poured out my heart out to her, she finally agreed to meet me Saturday morning at a Starbucks on East Brokaw in north San José if I promised not to follow her home. I promised.</p>
<p>I got there almost half an hour early, of course. She came in the door shortly before our "date" at 10, wearing jeans, T-shirt, and a hoodie. I jumped up intending to rush over and hug her, but she looked so startled that I sat back down, not wanting to scare her off. She slowly walked over to my table; I stood up— more slowly this time—and held out my arms for a hug. She hesitated a few moments, then stepped in and we hugged. Gently.</p>
<p>After I got our espressos, we exchanged the usual "you're looking good" and other banalities, then she asked me what I was doing now. I gave her the Reader's Digest version of my life, including the divorce and move to Hollister, then handed it over to her. "OK, your turn."</p>
<p>"Mine's a bit more complicated." That was a bit like saying Shakespeare was an okay writer. Her story proved to be a lot more complicated and took a lot longer to tell.</p>
<p>"Boston was interesting but Google wasn't a great place for a woman, and I never got into the spirit of driving as a fun contact sport. When a headhunter called and asked if I was interested in a job with an investment bank in Manhattan, I tried not to sound too eager." She flashed a little embarrassed smile at the admission. "I didn't even have to go into The City, they sent two people to interview me in Boston. The lead was a woman. They had me even before they mentioned the 35K raise."</p>
<p>I said "Wow" or something equally sophisticated, but she just shrugged as if it was no biggie. Not for the first time I wondered about my career choice.</p>
<p>"New York was all I hoped for, even more. Think Sex and the City with cheaper shoes and off-the-rack frocks." She paused, then held an embarrassed smile a bit longer, even blushed a little. "Well, to be honest, it was more like Girls, just better jobs and a nicer apartment. But the guys weren't any nicer, they just dressed better and spent more." Her eyes clouded before she continued.</p>
<p>"Then I met Hernán Cortés, at a gallery opening of a woman painter I knew. Before I had a chance to find her, this tall, dark, handsome fellow in a bespoke silk suit brought me a flute of champagne, and with a charming accent said he hated to see a beautiful woman look so thirsty. I decided to smile at his corny line, and we talked for a while." She took a sip of her still-hot espresso.</p>
<p>"Turned out he was a senior partner in a hedge fund, originally from Salamanca, and apparently filthy rich. Before the evening ended, we had exchanged phone numbers and agreed to meet again. He called a couple of days later and invited me to a dinner party at his place.</p>
<p>"Talk about Sex and the City! He sent a Town Car to whisk me off to his apartment building on the Upper East Side. The doorman was expecting me and escorted me to a private elevator that opened directly into his penthouse. Everything was glass and marble and stainless steel, the place was full of modern art and women in designer dresses." I tried to show that I was paying attention by making inane little comments like "Oh wow" or "Hmmm," but I really couldn't relate to her experience.</p>
<p>"He introduced me to VPs of Goldman Sachs and other big-time finance houses, some local politicians, a couple of ballplayers, an opera soprano. I recognized a bunch of names from the due diligence work I'd done at the bank and had to keep reminding myself to stop gawping like some star-struck teenager. After drinks and a marvelous dinner, guests started saying their goodbyes. When they were gone and the staff started cleaning up, Hernán kissed me on both cheeks, thanked me for making his evening memorable, and said the Town Car would take me back home, which it did. I wondered if I had failed some test I didn't understand."</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>She stopped, drained the last of her coffee, then apologized and said she had to go. I wanted to plead with her to stay, but again was afraid that I'd scare her off. Instead, I asked if we could meet again. A look of fear flashed across her face, then she closed her eyes and shook her head twice. She reached across the table, squeezed my hand, and asked if we could meet at the same time and place the following morning. I happily agreed with relief. We hugged gently for a second time in the parking lot, then drove our separate ways.</p>
<p>Our next meeting went more smoothly. After I got our coffees—she offered to buy but I played the guy card—she picked up her story.</p>
<p>"Yesterday I said I wondered if I had failed a test when he just kissed my cheeks and had the driver take me home. I learned the following week that I hadn't. He called me that Thursday and asked if I would like to go out for dinner and dancing on Saturday. Of course I said yes. He said we'd have to get an early start because he had some meetings, and suggested that I bring an overnight bag with cosmetics and a change of underwear; he would provide my evening wear. I was a little taken aback, but figured in for a dime, in for a dollar." She shook her head and smiled ruefully at the memory.</p>
<p>"He wasn't kidding about an early start! The same driver picked me up at 9:30 Saturday morning, crossed the Hudson to Teterboro, pulled up to a chain-link gate, opened it by pressing a button on the steering wheel, and drove up to a private jet. The driver opened my door and carried my overnight bag up the steps to the plane. Hernán met us at the door, thanked the driver, led me to a seat, kissed my hand, and disappeared into the cockpit. As the plane started taxiing, a lovely young woman brought me a champagne flute of orange juice and said that Mr. Cortés thought I would like a mimosa. I did, and had another. After I dozed for a while, she brought me a lovely Cobb salad and a glass of white wine. Both were delicious.</p>
<p>"The whole thing felt surreal, but that wasn't the half of it. When we landed a few hours later, Hernán led me to a waiting helicopter. We headed for the ocean, and half an hour later set down at some fancy resort on an island. A stretch limo was waiting for us, and whisked us off to this place that looked like something out of a fairy tale."</p>
<p>She learned later that the plane was a Cessna Citation X, that they had landed at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, then helicoptered to Santa Catalina Island. The fairy-tale place was the Avalon Casino, with a wonderful restaurant, theater, and grand ballroom on the top floor.</p>
<p>"We started in the restaurant. The hostess led me to the ladies restroom where a crimson cocktail dress, matching heels, and cinnamon hose were laid out for me. After the best salmon I've ever tasted, we went up to the ballroom and danced for an hour. We ended with a passionate tango that left me feeling almost like we had had sex. Which, of course, is how you should feel after a proper tango." I was relieved to see a fleeting grin after that last.</p>
<p>"Then we retraced our steps—limo to helicopter to jet to Teterboro—in time for sunrise. I slept much of the way back, and worried about Hernán flying for so long. But our landing at Teterboro was smooth as silk, and he came out from the cockpit looking as fresh as when we started.</p>
<p>"He sat next to me and asked if I enjoyed our little outing. I laughed and said 'You call that a little outing? I'm till trying to decide whether it really happened or was a dream.' He assured me it wasn't a dream, and said he'd love to give me more dreamy experiences. He carried my overnight bag out of the plane where the Town Car was waiting. Again, he kissed my cheeks and sent me on my way. As you might guess, I was dazzled but puzzled—a bit disappointed, even, that he didn't expect anything more." She picked up her coffee with both hands, put her elbows on the table, and held the cup against her forehead for a few seconds before continuing. It was obviously getting difficult for her to tell me what had happened.</p>
<p>She described some memorable dates with Cortés that followed: La Bohème at the Metropolitan Opera, a fund-raiser at Gracie Mansion, another dinner party in his apartment with movers and shakers. He finally invited her to an intimate dinner at his apartment, plied her with champagne, and seduced her, skillfully if not passionately. After two more dates that ended in his bed, he told her he loved her.</p>
<p>A week later he invited her to a weekend at his summer place in Darien, CT. After a quiet dinner Saturday night, he showed her a big diamond ring (she learned it was almost three carats) and asked her to marry him. Despite some misgivings, she was carried away by his wealth and the fairy-tale courtship and said yes. He persuaded her to agree to a rushed wedding, which inspired more misgivings, but again she ignored them. Two weeks later they were married, a brief ceremony in the living room of his Darien house. It was performed by Fr. Frank Fagella, a Catholic priest who was a friend of Cortés.</p>
<p>"I can't remember why I went along with the short notice and secrecy. He didn't even want me to tell my friends in New York or family back in California. The get-outta-Dodge account that Cass talked me into turned out to be a lifesaver."</p>
<p>Cass was her closest friend in New York. Before Marcie met Cortés, Cass had advised her to open a special account at J.P. Morgan Private Banking that allowed her to withdraw as much as she wanted from any Wells Fargo ATM in the country. Cass also told her to prime it with $5000, and always keep at least $500 in her purse for emergencies. I learned later why she called it a lifesaver.</p>
<p>"A few weeks after the wedding, we started spending every weekend in Darien. After a couple of months of that, he said he'd rather move to Darien and spend a few days a week in the City. I said I would go in with him on those days because my boss would probably agree to my working a few days from home, but Hernán got angry and said I had to quit my job, that I could find some volunteer charity work in Darien to keep my busy. I didn't want to quit, but I didn't want to make him angry, either, so I went along.</p>
<p>"He started spending four or five days a week in New York City, and inviting shady-looking characters over for dinner or a barbecue on weekends. He hardly ever introduced me to them, but insisted that I be there and to wear 'a nice outfit' which meant revealing. I got worried and said something, but he got very angry and accused me of being a snob." She waved me quiet when I started to say something.</p>
<p>"I know, I'm not sure why I stayed with him. About six months after the wedding, we went out to dinner at a supper club near the water and joined two men at a table. I didn't like that he hadn't said anything about them beforehand, and I didn't like their looks. They had well-manicured hands and wore Armani suits, but they just looked like well-dressed thugs."</p>
<p>She started to take another drink of coffee, then put it back down so quickly she spilled a little. "This is stupid! We don't need to keep meeting in such a public place. I know I can trust you. Do you have time to follow me to my place so I can finish?" She continued before I could even open my mouth to answer.</p>
<p>"Not for sex, just some privacy. It feels so good to finally get this story out, but it gets uglier and more embarrassing. You're the only person I can imagine telling." I was tempted to pump my fist and shout YES, but I had just won the lottery and wasn't going to lose it all by doing something stupid. After grabbing a couple of sandwiches, I followed her to Milpitas, just north of San José. Sunday morning traffic was pretty light, so it took us less than half an hour. Her place was a nondescript apartment in a nondescript complex in a nondescript neighborhood; none of it was either upscale or rundown, it was just...there.</p>
<p>SHE GAVE ME a quick tour of the apartment; it was a bit shopworn, a symphony in tired beige except for the only bedroom. She opened the door and let me see that she had decked it out as her cam-girl studio, with a few splashes of color and character; I recognized the bed, chair, and posters. She looked embarrassed and quickly shut the door, then we sat at her kitchen table with our sandwiches and a couple of Cokes. After a wry comment about not being on the Upper East Side anymore (I judiciously replied with a noncommittal "mmmm"), she picked up her story.</p>
<p>"Where were we? Oh yeah, Hernán and his two creepy goons. We were at Giovanni's by Holly Pond. After he ordered drinks, we waited in a pretty uncomfortable silence. When the drinks came, the three of them started talking about some project that wasn't going well. It was all pretty vague, they obviously didn't want me to know what they were talking about." Her voice was getting quieter. I was afraid she might be regretting her decision to talk, might even break off meeting with me.</p>
<p>"Marcie, you don't have to tell me anything you don't want to. There's no rush. I hope we'll be spending a lot of time together." She smiled and said she hoped so, too. I couldn't help breaking out in a goofy grin, but she wanted to continue.</p>
<p>Her story got even darker. After a few minutes of the threesome's guarded conversation, she excused herself to go to the bathroom. On the way back, she saw that they seemed to be arguing and stepped out of sight behind a waiter's station, where she could watch unnoticed. The goons were angrily complaining, but she couldn't make out the words. Cortés held up his hands to placate them, then took a small bottle from his coat pocket, held it up, and dropped something into her drink.</p>
<p>When she finished describing this, she closed her eyes for a moment, then continued with an edge to her voice that hadn't been there.</p>
<p>"He was going to drug me and offer me to those two animals! I had to get out, and left by the back door. When I got into the car I started to cry, but I couldn't afford time for that so I shook it off and drove away. Thank God for Cass's emergency drill!" Caught in the memory, she was clenching and unclenching her hands on the table; I put mine over them trying to calm her. She finally resumed her tale.</p>
<p>She took the battery and SIM card out of her phone and drive to a Wells Fargo ATM in Stamford. It took her five minutes to withdraw $2000 in twenties, then she parked in the UConn Stamford parking garage and walked to Target. Twenty-five minutes had passed since she left Giovanni's. She bought a few changes of clothes, a roller bag, and a prepaid phone, then continued down Broad to the Marriott Courtyard. After changing into one of the Target outfits in the restroom, she caught the airport shuttle to JFK and began her odyssey back to California.</p>
<p>She was sure that Cortés would be looking for her and didn't know what resources he had, but assumed the worst and tried not to panic. On the other hand, thanks to Cass she had resources he didn't know about; in addition to the cash, she had a genuine Texas driver's license and Visa card in the name of Katarina Ileana Romano (Cass had several "talented" friends). From JFK she took a taxi to Penn Station, then the Acela to Washington.</p>
<p>"I found a fairly private spot on the train and called Cass with my prepaid phone. I was afraid she wouldn't answer, but she picked it up on the third ring. All I could do was say 'Cass! It's me!' before I started crying. She told me to take some deep breaths and calm down. I finally did—well, I stopped crying anyway—and told her what had happened, starting with the wedding. She interrupted a few times to get me to skip details, but didn't comment until I finished. 'Shit! I didn't much like him when you introduced me, but I didn't imagine he was such an asshole.'" To my relief, Marcie managed a weak smile.</p>
<p>"Neither did I. When she asked me what I was going to do, I said I wanted to go back to California. She told me to use the fake ID and credit card to fly, but to Sacramento just in case Cortés was able to have the Bay Area airports watched. I told her I could catch the train to Oakland and take it from there. She told me for the fourth or fifth time to be careful. When the train pulled into Oakland, I was so relieved I just sat in the restroom and cried for a while."</p>
<p>Her folks still lived in Grass Valley but she didn't want to trouble them. They had been puzzled and hurt when she finally told them a month after the fact that she was married, but she had assured them that she was neither pregnant nor unhappy with them, and promised to explain the next visit. She caught a bus to San José and rented a room in Motel 6. Using the computer and printer in a branch library, put together a resumé and emailed requests for letters of recommendation from Google and the investment bank with a personal message that it was a matter of some urgency. They emailed outstanding letters two days later. Three weeks after that (a bit nervous because she was beginning to run low on cash), she landed a job with a venture capital outfit in Menlo Park and rented her Milpitas apartment.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a hostile environment for women. Just short of six months later, she quit with a nice severance package, thanks to her well-documented threat of a sexual harassment suit. "They were as just bad as Hernán, but were very careful and kept everything public just inside the legal boundaries. I was pretty soured on industry, but my MBA included a couple of courses on non-profit issues, so I put together a tweaked resumé and cold-called the Community Foundation. I got a job because their VP of Strategic Planning had abruptly quit. If I'd known why she quit I would have fled in disarray, but I just congratulated myself for being so lucky." Her salary fell 50 percent, but she figured it was worth it because a non-profit wouldn't have a sexually charged atmosphere that preyed on women. She was wrong.</p>
<p>"If anything, it was worse. The big shots worked hard to maintain their public image of social responsibility, but ran the place as it if were their own personal hedge fund. The development officers who went after the big donors—all women—were expected to do 'whatever was needed' to get the big bucks. The bosses managed to funnel off money for off-site luxury 'retreats' that were actually weekend-long sex parties with lots of drugs and booze. Some trusted major contributors and execs from Silicon Valley were invited, along with some pricey, discrete escorts. Naturally, with a corporate culture like that, the Foundation attracted the same sort of asshole predators I'd had to deal with before."</p>
<p>She realized what was going on just a few weeks after her hiring, but didn't want to just walk away and let them continue bilking donors and abusing staffers. She stored files on a memory stick that described what was going on, with copies of documents and directions of where to look for the financial manipulations, and got it in the hands of an investigative reporter at the San José Mercury-News. She left, along with most of the remaining staff (the ones who hadn't been arrested), when the story hit the streets and Internet a month later. The Merc was a Pulitzer finalist that year thanks to its four-part series on the scandal, but lost to a series on water pollution in the Houston Chronicle.</p>
<p>"I'm pretty tired, Ben. Could we call it a day? I don't have a car yet, so you'll have to come back here if you want to wrap this up." With some difficulty I resisted saying anything about unwrapping; she suggested we meet for dinner at her place the next evening. When she kissed my cheek as I was leaving, it was even harder for me to resist throwing my arms around her and kissing her back. Instead, I just floated back to my car and sang (badly, of course) to my Beach Boys playlist all the way back to Hollister.</p>
<p>The next afternoon traffic up 101 and through San José was a bitch. I hadn't had to deal with freeway commuting, and before it was over I was ready to chew out the top of the steering wheel. Even though I allowed half an hour more than I thought it would take, I was still almost another half hour late. When I tried to apologize, Marcie shushed me and said I got there sooner than she expected because she knew how bad the traffic would be. Dinner was in the oven and we'd eat in about half an hour, so why didn't we sit in the living room and she'd finish her story. She dragged in a chair from the kitchen table and told me to sit on the couch. When I tried to switch with her, she just shook her head and told me to stay put.</p>
<p>"I'm sure you've been itching to ask me why on earth I'm camming, Ben. Believe me, it's something I don't want to talk about, but I desperately want to explain it to you so you won't think I'm a slut." When I tried to protest, she waved her hand to shut me up. "Just let me talk." She took a deep breath and gathered herself, just as she probably would before making a presentation to the Board of Directors. "You experienced part of what brought me to it when you were fighting that commute traffic. Even though my work experiences were much worse, the twice-a-day stress of crawling along the freeways really started getting to me.</p>
<p>"But that was just a small part of it, of course. After the shitstorm that followed the Merc articles I felt stupid and soiled, even though I never went to any of the sex parties or had anything to do with the theft of donations. I withdrew so much that for a couple of weeks all I did was sit here and eat takeout and feel sorry for myself. I didn't want anyone to know that I had worked there, but there really wasn't anyone who would know, because I didn't—I still don't—have any friends." She looked up with a dazzling smile. "Except now you, of course." The smile faded. She got up and paced around the small kitchen area a couple of times, then sat back down.</p>
<p>"When I started running low on money I realized I had to do something, but I didn't want to take another chance on working somewhere. My selection track record wasn't very good; in fact, I wasn't even sure I was worth hiring." She waved me quiet yet again when I opened my mouth to protest. "I know, I know, I wasn't being sensible and was probably temporarily depressed, but I had to do something. I went online and started researching how to make money at home. My fraud filter is pretty good, so I ignored almost everything that I found, and didn't even consider the first couple of references to camming. But as I kept winnowing out the obvious scams the hits on camming increased, so just out of curiosity I finally checked one out."</p>
<p>She said that working for herself really appealed to her, so she read several blogs and articles about camming, and finally started checking out websites. At first she was shocked, even horrified, turned off her computer and turned on the TV, then went to bed. But the next day she figured she better check it out some more because it looked like the most realistic way she could make money without having to go back to work somewhere else.</p>
<p>"I pretty much had no self-esteem at that point, Ben, and figured I wasn't worth any more than camming." I contented myself with snorting, but resolved to make sure she understood what she was really worth. "I spent the next 7 or 8 hours watching cam girls on different websites. A lot of them don't let you do much without paying, and almost all of them limit how much time you can spend without registering. But you can register with a fake email address, so I registered for a few. I probably watched a hundred different girls, a few couples, a few men, even a few transsexuals." She shook her head. "It was mostly pretty sad, not sexy, but it looked like I could get away with not completely whoring myself out."</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>She chatted with a few bloggers to try to find out how much she'd have to do to earn enough money and what equipment she needed. She still had money left from her settlement with the venture capitalists, so she bought a refurbished desktop, a wireless keyboard and mouse, a digital camera good for streaming, a high-speed modem-router, and all the cables, power strips, and adapters needed to set it up. It took her two days to get it all up and running properly, another two days to register with a website and get verified.</p>
<p>"The first time I went live, I was scared to death. A few guys—I always assumed they were guys—came in right away, I suppose because my thumbnail picture was labeled NEW. I was wearing what I decided would be my signature outfit, as you know: a plain camisole and bikini panties. I hadn't really planned what I was going to say or do, just what I wasn't going to. I stumbled through a couple of pretty embarrassing hours, had to quit because I was getting queasy and was afraid I'd throw up. I made something like $12.50 that first day."</p>
<p>I had to interrupt. "Marcie, I know what you did, you don't have to tell me about it. I watched you for two months. The reason I kept coming back was precisely because you didn't do or say the stuff most of the other cam girls did. I could tell from the beginning there was something special about you, and boy was I right. So shut up already! It's my turn to tell you what you're really worth!" I wasn't going to let her shush me again, but almost panicked when I wondered if my outburst would drive her away.</p>
<p>I intended to start off by reciting a few of her outstanding qualities and how they made her special, but when she turned to me with a shy smile and simply said 'Okay, Ben," I forgot what they were. Except for her eyes, which melted my heart, and her mouth, which drew my breath, and her breasts, which roused my beast within, and her...</p>
<p>"Ben?" She got up from the kitchen chair, sat beside me on the couch, and put her hand on my arm.</p>
<p>"You were going to tell me something?" Her shy smile had changed to sort of a smirk, her eyes crinkled and twinkled, my brain turned to mush. Without thinking, I reached out to her.</p>
<p>"Uhh, yeah, well...I love you, Marcie, have for as long as—."Without saying anything, she leaned in and put her arms around me and buried her face in my neck.</p>
<p>"Oh thank God," she murmured, then looked up, her lips inches from mine. "I love you, too, Ben Day. I think I better turn off the oven and put dinner in the fridge for a while." She gave me a short, but intense kiss, then stood up and sashayed into the kitchen, calling back over her shoulder, "I'll meet you in the bedroom." I tried not to run. She joined me less than a minute later. "Give me a moment to redecorate." She stripped the bedspread and tossed it over the computer and camera, yanked their plugs out of the wall, and tore the posters off the wall. "There. Now lets perforate Unperforated." Her shy smile returned. "It's okay, Ben. I love you, too. Please let me show you how much; I don't want to lose you again."</p>
<p>She was giving me permission—no, she was asking me to make love to her. I don't remember exactly how we started, but I do remember worshiping her breasts with my lips and tongue, then sliding past her navel and past the downy slope to her mons. When I reached the fringe of her protective bush, I chuckled in wonder at reaching my goal and tilted my head back to gaze upon her breathtaking womanhood. She reached down, somewhat gently grasped my ears, and looked into my eyes with a stern stare. "I'm pretty sure I'll love what you're about to do, but just one crack about Chapman's Homer, mister, and you'll spend the next week trying to remember when you took a vow of celibacy."</p>
<p>I didn't keep my mouth shut, but no words passed my tongue or lips; they were too busy exploring my beloved and sipping her ambrosia. As I slipped into Paradise, she put her lips to my ear. "Thank you, but I probably couldn't have held out a day, let alone a week."</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>AFTER MARCIE HAD TOLD her what happened, Cass whispered into the shell-pink ear of another of her talented friends, who passed along the information about Hernán Cortés to the FBI. She was delighted to tell Marcie less than two months after she fled that Cortés and all his men were arrested on a dozen or so federal charges related to drugs, human trafficking, and tax evasion. They all wound up in Club Fed for at least 20 years.</p>
<p>It turned out that "Father" Frank Fagella had, indeed, been a Catholic priest once upon a time, but was "allowed to leave the priesthood" after it was found he embezzled a few hundred thousand dollars from the Archdiocese of New York and had sexual affairs with several married women in his Brooklyn parish. He escaped prosecution, of course. All this happened more than a decade before the ceremony in Darien, so he had no faculties for marriage, and he shredded the "marriage license" they signed instead of filing it with Fairfield County. Consequently, Marcie had never been married to Cortés. She wasn't broken-hearted about that, and neither was I.</p>
<p>We moved Marcie to my apartment in Hollister the week after our tryst in Milpitas. Two weeks later we drove up to Grass Valley for the Parental Visitation, which went much better than we had hoped. Marcie had already told them on the phone that she really was never married to "that guy," but the explanation would have to wait until we got there. At first they had a hard time believing her tale, but finally recognized that she was telling the truth as a means of apologizing "for the way I treated you." They assured her that she had nothing to apologize for, that all she had to do was love them. Then we all sniffed a little and hugged a lot.</p>
<p>That was almost 10 years ago. We married a few months after the visit with her folks, and now have three of the world's most perfect children: Elizabeth (for Marcie's mother), 10; Benito ( for Benjamin, over my futile objections), 7; and Ana (for Anastasia, just because), 5. I'm still teaching high school math and computer coding at San Benito STEM Academy (Go Condors!) and loving it, but then I've loved all of my life since I found Marcella Minerva Chapman and first looked into Chapman's quim.</p>
<p>My principal achievement after 19 submissions (17 stories and a couple of essays) has been to irritate folks, some mightily. If this story yet again irritates you, would you please take the time to tell me why in a comment? It might help me to stop (or at least cut down) doing so, could even be considered a public service. Babbling into the void is neither fun nor rewarding.</p>
