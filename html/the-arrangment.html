<p>It had been two years since Christine Andrews first saw her name on a brass plaque in the New York offices of HNF investments. She had been in charge of a lucrative hedge fund portfolio for some time and, as she predicted when she first got the job, she was almost completely uninterested.</p>
<p>Christine had actually made news when she was in college as a financial whiz kid after she invested her entire college loan in a high risk portfolio, when it paid off it made her a millionaire before she even graduated.</p>
<p>That sort of reputation gave her a fast track to the top of the investment world, but what she suspected was she had not been shrewd with her investment, she had been reckless and lucky. She hadn't decided to become a millionaire, she had gone all in on her future for the rush. Once her career had started she was moved to hedge funds, lots of individual risky investments, but collected so the risk was minimal. So she went through the movements, made friends, went to conferences and steadily accumulated a fortune, but she was desperately unfulfilled.</p>
<p>The solution to her ennui came one day when at one of the many management conferences she ended up at. Organised as the usual excuse to charge a five star holiday on the company buck, it had been decided that while the men had their golf tournament, the female contingent was going to hit the spa. The stress had been hitting Christine hard recently and a massage sounded like the right way forward.</p>
<p>Christine stripped naked, she did not do anything by halves and thus didn't want some vestigial attachment to decency to allow bra straps and panty lines to get in the way of a comprehensive rub down. She placed all her things in a locker and wrapped herself in a towel for the short walk to the parlour.</p>
<p>The young lady was an adequate masseuse and although Christine was relaxed no massage would have satisfied her. It wasn't until the end of the massage that things became interesting.</p>
<p>"So... would you be interested in a happy ending?" The masseuse whispered in Christine's ear.</p>
<p>"Oh, I didn't know it was that kind of spa." Christine replied shocked.</p>
<p>"It usually isn't, the organisers know a guy who discreetly provides our sorts of services and replaced the staff with us working girls." The masseuse chirped, rubbing her hands up and down Christine's back.</p>
<p>"Not really my vice I'm afraid." Christine politely declined.</p>
<p>"Then what is your vice? We indulge all sorts here." The masseuse responded, making Christine take some time to think.</p>
<p>"Used to be gambling, but when you have as much money as me it gets less interesting." Christine revealed, surprising herself with the honesty she was indulging with a woman she had met ten minutes ago.</p>
<p>"Some clients enjoy playing games of chance with forfeits, maybe we could play something?" Christine sat up intrigued, "how about I flip a coin? Heads I don't get a tip, tails you tip me the key to your locker" Even contemplating taking the bet was making Christine feel more excited than she had done in years. When she was young, money was tight, it was the most important resource, but now the most important thing in all her circles was esteem, the thought of walking back to her room wearing only a towel was a real risk and it made Christine giddy.</p>
<p>"Yes!" She answered enthusiastically. The coin was tossed high and Christine's heart fluttered as the masseuse snatched it out of the air and slowly opened her hand. Tails.</p>
<p>Christine blushed as she handed over her locker key, the towel was large and luxurious but hardly appropriate for a walk across a hotel. The masseuse giggled at the prospect of some high end clothes and jewellery she could sell, but as she went to leave Christine interrupted her.</p>
<p>"How about double or nothing?" The masseuse stopped and cocked an intrigued eyebrow. "Another flip of the coin, heads I get my locker key back and you are handsomely tipped to compensate, tails you get my towel." Christine was doing what she had always done, get a taste for something then immediately dive in with both feet. She hadn't had a thrill like this for a long time and she wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to go deeper. The masseuse smiled and got her coin out again, Christine eyeing her fate hungrily. Flipping the coin high in the air, Christine's joy was so overwhelming she barely registered the coin coming up tails.</p>
<p>Christine heard the laughter of the masseuse echo down the hallway as she peaked around the door. The masseuse had been kind enough to let her have two things, a key to her hotel room and a business card for her boss. The spa was attached to the hotel so she at least wouldn't have to go outside, but the route back to her room was still fraught with danger. She waited until the corridor was clear and sprinted towards the spa entrance, clasping her more than ample breasts to her chest. She skipped around the door and immediately dived behind the reception desk. It wasn't until she saw a pair of feet in high heels that she realised the desk she had hidden beneath had a women sat at it.</p>
<p>"Shhh" she quickly indicated to the startled receptionist. "I will pay you $5000 not to tell anyone you saw me." The receptionist was about to answer when the sound of the door opening caused her to look up. Christine's heart was beating out of her chest at the thought of the new arrival.</p>
<p>"Evening Rachael." Came a Stern British voice. "Any of the women left the spa yet?"</p>
<p>"No sir," the receptionist replied, giving Christine cause to be happy.</p>
<p>"Great, I figured the men won't be back from golfing for a while, so now's the time to get the room cleans done. Radio to me if anyone leaves would you." The voice responded, getting fainter as it headed to the door. Christine's breathing slowed as she heard the door shut.</p>
<p>"It's clear. Do you want me to get you a gown?" The receptionist asked. Christine considered this, in theory the bet was just for her stuff, but at the same time it felt like asking for a gown would be welching on the spirit of the bet. She had lost and if she didn't live with the consequences she wouldn't be able to enjoy the experience in hindsight.</p>
<p>"No thank you," Christine stammered, hardly believing the words had left her mouth. "Just come to room 703 in an hour's time and I'll get you your money." She got out from behind the desk and began walking towards the door, catching her naked reflection in a mirrored glass panel. Her long brown hair was usually tied up around the office, so with her hair down and her body oiled up from the massage, the reflection stunned her for a second. She opened the door and began the long walk to her room.</p>
<p>By the time she had reached her room, Christine wasn't even trying to hide. She had promised four other shocked staff members $5000 to keep their mouths shut. Although embarrassing, the thing that made her stomach drop more was the idea of being seen by one of her co-workers. As well as drinking in the experience, Christine spent her time already thinking of how to experience this high on a recurring basis. She got to her room and immediately made a bee-line for the phone, dialling the number on the business card, eager to talk to 'Kipper the fixer'.</p>
<p>Kipper turned out to have a room in the hotel and once she had redressed and paid off some staff Christine was immediately there. A short man in an impeccable suit stood by a breakfast bar, clearly awaiting Christine.</p>
<p>"Good afternoon Kipper. I have a lucrative proposal for you." Christine immediately stated, holding her hand out for him to shake and ensuring a business-like tone for their interactions. Christine had been thinking hard on this proposal and needed to get it out of her mind and into reality.</p>
<p>"I just had a rather enjoyable encounter with one of your staff and was looking forward to repeating it. I'm sure you are clued into the calendar of events for the circles myself and my co-workers move in. Ahead of certain events I will request your services, you will bring me one of your working girls, one without tattoos or body piercings, long brunette hair, and a body type similar to mine. I will send ahead a program of embarrassing actions that I have planned, then you will witness me flipping a coin, heads she goes through with the actions, tails I will be doing them and she can have the evening off." Kipper sat in thought for a second.</p>
<p>"This seems fairly standard, why do you need me involved?" He enquired.</p>
<p>"Because some of these things will involve exposure to my co-workers while wearing a mask. Sometimes your working girl will expose herself with me present to form my alibi, sometimes I will not be present but it still needs to be thought to be her. So I need her otherwise unavailable on those nights and when people start asking about a girl who keeps flashing our events, I'm going to need you to leak that a male client gets his kicks from it. I'm also fairly certain that had I not taken you into my confidence word would have gotten back to you eventually anyway."</p>
<p>"Seems like you thought it through." Kipper calmly acknowledged.</p>
<p>"Yes, and for these services I will pay you $250,000 a year. This figure is large so any time someone wants to bribe you with a one off fee to know my secret, be aware that you would be passing up a regular recurring fee that will add up to something far more substantial in the long run." Christine let her breath escape her body as she finished her pitch. Kipper calmly got up and fetched his lap top.</p>
<p>"It's a good thing you came to me with this proposal, I was actually originally hired to get blackmail material for another one of your co-workers, hence the surprise prostitute in the spa." Kipper opened his laptop to a recording from the hotel security cameras of Christine strutting down the hallways naked and oiled. "I was about to show them this when you called but I suppose $250,000 a year to provide half a service is a good enough deal for me to delete the footage." Christine marvelled at her embarrassment on the screen.</p>
<p>"I mean you shouldn't share this, but how about you keep it? Just in case the coin comes up tails and I try to back out." Christine replied with a cheeky grin. They exchanged bank account details and emails, then just like that the agreement was set. Christine promised she would be in touch in the near future.</p>
<p>It was about a fortnight before the next opportunity, a corporate conference on innovation in investment. Christine had spent that time planning her long term strategy. She had picked five other regular female attenders of these events and had calculated that if she only went through with the arrangement at retreats that the other five were present at, nobody could conclusively figure out she was the common link. She had also faked up a fatiguing condition, giving her an excuse to occasionally be unavailable for an evening.</p>
<p>Christine opened up an email and sent it to Kipper. It read:</p>
<p>"I will arrive early and unseen to the conference centre. If the coin comes up heads I will be present at the welcome session when your girl runs across the stage wearing only a mask, otherwise I will text my colleagues telling them I am running late before running across the stage naked myself." Christine smiled to herself as she pressed send.</p>
<p>When the day arrived Christine was giddy with anticipation, she arrived good and early and went straight to Kipper's room, where he was waiting with the masseuse that had first played with Christine. Her hair was dyed a deeper shade of brown to match Christine's and Kipper assured her that her body type was as similar to Christine's as could be. She introduced herself as Starla and talked about how much she looked forward to working with Christine into the future.</p>
<p>After the strange small talk was over, Kipper showed Christine the security feed for the Conference Hall, it was beginning to fill up and the welcome speech would begin shortly. He held out the coin with a smile and gave Christine a moment to drink in the dread of flashing her colleagues. He flicked the coin, the high pitched wine of the metal being struck reverberating throughout the room and cutting through Christine like a knife. He opened his hand to reveal that heads had won and Christine gasped with relief, drinking in the casual resignation of Starla.</p>
<p>"You better go take your place." Kipper announced with a smile, as Starla began to strip her clothes off right there and then.</p>
<p>Christine went into a daze as she grabbed her conference badge, made small talk with her colleagues and began to listen to yet another speech about shifting investment paradigms outside the box. She let out a little squeak as she saw a leg appear at the curtains on the side. The crowd gasped as all of a sudden a naked woman sprinted across the stage, her face obscured by a leather cat mask that let her hair flow behind with the momentum of running. All were in shock apart from Christine, who looked up imagining how the slightest alteration on the physics applied to an airborne rotating metal cylinder could have meant that being her on stage.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day the streaker was on everyone's lips. Nobody addressed what had happened directly, but she became a key figure in joke punchlines and throwaway comments for every seminar and talk Christine took herself to. The thought that it could have been her drove her wild with delight. By the second day the rumour that one of the managers was into watching prostitutes expose themselves had firmly taken ahold, giving Christine reason to smile at her choice of accomplice. At night Christine spent a good amount of time in her room, tossing a coin to herself to remind herself of the high when the coin was in the air and anything was possible.</p>
<p>The conference was a week-long affair and the next was in a month's time. Christine decided there was no way she could go that long without the rush of another coin flip. She composed the email to Kipper.</p>
<p>"I wish to have one more coin flip this conference. Saturday morning at the end of the men's golf tournament. Loser of the coin flip has to go into the club bar naked and kiss the winner."</p>
<p>Christine felt a familiar tingle as she clicked "send." Kipper did not take long to respond that Starla was available and to meet at his hotel room Saturday at 10:00am.</p>
<p>The rest of the conference was a frustrating blur for Christine, with no concentration on anything but the dragging of time, the sound of a flipping coin resonating through her mind. Eventually Saturday arrived, but Christine got very little sleep beforehand.</p>
<p>Kipper was waiting for her, coin in hand. Christine's stomach turned itself in knots as he slowly lined the coin up on his hands and prepared the flick. It went high into the air before landing on his hand, Christine's fate sealed awaiting the reveal. He moved his hand away and Christine saw the tails of the coin mocking her.</p>
<p>"I suppose we better get to it then" Kipper announced in a matter of fact way, opening the hotel door and gesturing for Christine to go through. They made their way to his car and as they drove to the golf club, Kipper explained the plan.</p>
<p>"So I have told the person running the tournament that I will be providing a prize for the winner. You can strip now as you will be leaving your clothes in the car. You will come with me, I will lead you up to the front to kiss the winner and then lead you back to the car." Christine began to strip off her clothes, hesitating at Kipper's intense look. Yes Kipper had seen her naked before on a monitor, but it was entirely different to have him sitting in front of her eyeing her up and down.</p>
<p>"Where's the mask?* She asked, now stripped to her underwear.</p>
<p>"Email never said anything about a mask." Kipper curtly replied. Christine had to admit he was right but that didn't make it OK. Surely the terms of the agreement made it clear her identity should be protected? She was just about to get angry when Kipper continued, "I'll tell you what, how about another flip? Heads you get a mask, tails we stick to your original plan."</p>
<p>All Christine wanted to do was to tell him to get fucked, she was risking enough as it was. But then Kipper started absentmindedly flipping a coin in front of her and the chilling thoughts of risk burrowed deep into her psyche. She unclasped her bra, removed her knickers, handed her bundle of clothes to Kipper then nodded in agreement. Naked and vulnerable the coin whizzed through the air and landed in Kipper's hand.</p>
<p>Heads.</p>
<p>Christine sighed with relief as Kipper pulled a gimp mask out of his suitcase, clearly demonstrating this move was pre-planned.</p>
<p>"I was going to have you and Starla wear that iconic cat mask at every turn to establish an identity, but this is the only mask in my collection you can kiss someone while wearing. And don't you think about giving the winner a peck on the cheek, if I don't see your tongue go into his mouth I'm not letting you back into the car." Christine couldn't believe she was letting some unknown pimp talk to her this way, like she wasn't a wealthy member of high society. She was beginning to feel the rage well up within her until she realised he was talking to her exactly as he should, he was a winner addressing a loser. Once she accepted her position, all her objections, her hatred of the situation, the absolute humiliation, were all swept under a rug titled "you should have won."</p>
<p>Christine pulled the mask over her head as the car pulled up outside the golf club and parked next to the entrance to the clubhouse. There was an awkward silence as Kipper kept an eye on his phone for the cue to enter. Christine checked her reflection in the mirror and began to tuck errant strands of hair into the mask.</p>
<p>"You know with a body like yours, I'd probably hire you if everything goes tits up." Kipper announced to break the silence. "Clearly you have a gym membership, you're nicely toned, although if you were one of mine you'd probably need to cut back on the calories a little, starting to get a bit of a tummy. But those tits! I got girls who won't pay off the surgical costs for five years just to get breasts like yours." Kipper's phone buzzed and Christine felt relieved that he had stopped talking immediately followed by dread of what the text message entailed.</p>
<p>Kipper opened the door and with a wide grin held out his arm to help Christine out of the car. Christine could feel her breathing inside the mask as she stood and began to walk towards the boisterous noise coming from the club bar, the occasional round of cheers and applause confirming they were handing out prizes. Kipper signalled for Christine to hide around the corner and wait for his signal, leaving her alone and naked in the club corridors.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, Gentlemen." His voice floated out from the bar, making Christine shiver with each word. "When I heard that Bertie had finished at a whopping four under par, I had to come and congratulate him myself." Christine swore to herself, Bertie was the most stuck up, pompous, entitled, old money, do nothing in HNF investments. In the rare moments he was not playing golf on the company buck he would lech around the office making every woman under the age of 50 feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Then when I told some business colleagues of mine about Bertie's Sterling performance, one in particular decided that to just send their congratulations was simply not enough. Why don't you come show Bertie how impressed you are?" Kipper yelled, signalling for Christine to enter.</p>
<p>Christine clenched her fists and walked into the crowded room. Her bosses, her equals and even some of her subordinates turned to look her body up and down, eyeing her up like wolves circling a piece of meat. She reached the edge of the bar where Bertie was clasping his award, his ridiculous colourful golf trousers doing a terrible job of hiding his erection. Christine sauntered up to him, grabbed his hips and pulled his body against hers, she looked into his lecherous eyes and swallowed her pride before pressing her lips to his. Bertie did not immediately react, the shock keeping his mouth closed. So Christine decided to pull her face away and go back in for another kiss, this time leading with her tongue sensuously licking his lips on the way into his mouth. Her stomach doing backflips as the crowd cheered and Bertie used his one free hand to dramatically grab her bottom.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Kipper promptly thanked them all and led Christine out while she tried desperately to ignore the errant hands that found her bottom on the way to the door. Christine got back to the car and immediately put her clothes back on, relieved her ordeal was over.</p>
<p>Christine ended up writing an email to Kipper about the rude and disrespectful he talked to her. The email stated in the strongest possible terms that talking to her like that after she loses a coin toss is highly encouraged for both him and Starla.</p>
<p>For the next couple of months, Christine ended up having a run of unusually good luck with the coin flips and it felt amazing. She had watched as Starla burst out of a cake at a birthday party, streak a home run at the company softball game, and even attended a charity ball against animal experimentation locked in a cage for an hour dressed up like a slutty bunny. The closest she came to disaster was losing a coin flip on washing cars naked at a charity car wash, only to win the double or nothing roll that would have had her arrive tied to the bonnet of Kipper's car. Each time she won Christine laughed and gloated, she was gambling on the most high risk stakes and was currently a high roller. The fear and risk coalescing into joy and relief.</p>
<p>Christine was somewhat surprised when Kipper contacted her with an opportunity to gamble, it was a departure from their usual agreement of her setting the terms of the bet, but not an unwelcome one. She stated that she was under no obligation to take the bet before going to meet Kipper at a very expensive hotel.</p>
<p>"The reason I asked you to come here is I have a betting opportunity I think you would like, and would have otherwise never found out about. Have you ever heard of the 'Feast of Beasts?' Christine admitted she hadn't heard of it. "The feast is a highly secret party I organise once a year. It is, bluntly put, a men only masquerade dinner party, where they are served by masked waitresses in skimpy bikinis and told they need not keep their hands to themselves. Starla is down to be a waitress, but I figured why not give you an opportunity to have a coin flip off the back of this, risk you putting on a bikini for the night and be groped by your colleagues?" Christine contemplated this for a minute, it sounded absolutely humiliating, becoming a servant and a piece of meat was something she couldn't possibly countenance, it was perfect.</p>
<p>Christine's mind raced as she agreed, her stomach boiled when she saw the coin and watched it get tossed into the air, Kipper caught it and a huge grin crossed his face, as he showed Christine the coin, tails side up, she knew her luck had run out.</p>
<p>"Double or nothing? How about I get another chance and if I lose I don't wear the bikini" She pleaded, hoping for a way out. Kipper's grin grew wider, he had clearly planned for this.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid people would ask questions if one waitress was naked and the rest weren't. Then again there is a way we could go double or nothing. Starla here was only signed up to be a waitress, but at the end there is also an auction that a few of the more cash strapped girls participate in. Ostensibly they are bidding for the girl's bikini, but depending on how much is bid, men can also get bonus awards of a kiss, a private dance, a blow job, or in the most extreme cases, they can get to fuck the girl." Christine actually felt reluctant for this first time in this endeavour, if she lost this coin flip there was a chance she could temporarily become one of Kipper's whores.</p>
<p>"Don't worry Christine." Starla reassured. "Last year they bid over one hundred thousand dollars for someone and they still ended up only giving away their bikini, and with the best will in the world, with a body like yours I don't think you're going to reach that much."</p>
<p>Starla's words only reassured Christine a little, but they did awaken a thought in her, these are millionaires and the auction would be boring if everyone got to screw the prize. So it was a 50% chance of being put into the auction, and on top of that there was only a small chance of doing the unthinkable. Plus there was still a way out if heads came up, and Christine didn't get to where she was today by cutting her losses when things got tough. Christine silenced the butterflies in her stomach and nodded.</p>
<p>Kipper once again got out the fabled coin and tossed it high in the air, the ring of the metal reverberating in Christine's bones. He caught the coin, flipped it onto the back of his hand lingered his other hand over it, drinking in the look of trepidation on Christine's face. He called over Starla to look at the coin first and so deliver the news to Christine.</p>
<p>"Sorry honey, its tails. Looks like I get the night off and you get to find out just how much your ass is worth." Starla mocked, channelling all the gloating and goading she had been on the receiving end of for the past couple of months. Now that the bet was over, Kipper led Christine over to see her outfit.</p>
<p>"This year's feast is superhero themed, so I figured it was only fair to make you my little Catwoman." He announced holding up a leather Catwoman mask, a pile of black string that Christine assumed would become a bikini when she untangled it, and some black platform high heels that looked fresh from a strip club. He also pointed her attention to the bathroom where a razor and shaving cream awaited her, and a mirror on a desk in the corner with makeup and body glitter laid out ready. "I like my girls prompt and presentable, so I expect to see you in the kitchen, shaved, dolled up, and ready to receive orders in an hour." Kipper ordered strutting out of the room with a smug Starla in tow.</p>
<p>Three quarters of an hour later Christine studied herself in the mirror with a sneer on her face. The bikini seemed to be more lewd than just going naked, the spaghetti straps pulled tight to her body and where the fabric did expand for the breast cups, they weren't even large enough to cover the entirety of her nipples, the dark circles peeking out the side. The thong pulled so tight that it took effort to keep her pussy lips from overflowing around the small black triangle of modesty fabric. She was grateful for the opportunity to shave her pussy as the hair would have looked stupid overflowing round the sides of the thong. She had used the makeup to give herself some luscious lips and smoky eyes before pulling the mask over her face and shakily leaving the hotel room.</p>
<p>She walked through the banquet hall, where staff were still setting up for that evening's events, drawing a few lingering looks that seemed to stay with her as she entered the kitchen. Lined up by the door were several other women in similar skimpy outfits and masks, listening to Kipper brief them on that night's events.</p>
<p>"Nice of you to join us Catwoman, get in line and listen carefully. Tonight you will be groped and spanked, you need to keep a calm and professional demeanour at all times. When carrying trays, you hold them with one hand to the side so we're not hiding your bodies. Now if you're being auctioned tonight step forward and turn around." Christine was one of four that did so. She suddenly felt something make contact with her bottom, she turned around to see that Kipper had stamped "for sale" on her left cheek. Kipper then went over their assignments, leaving Christine until last</p>
<p>"Catwoman, you're starting on the front door, handing champagne to the new arrivals, afterwards you will be table service for tables 1-4. Remember no matter what they ask of you, you have to do it. Tonight you are a working girl and they have paid good money for you. When dessert is served you'll come to the stage at the front to be auctioned. Now get to that table before people start arriving." Kipper ordered pointing to the entrance.</p>
<p>Christine dejectedly walked to her position, stood next to a table filled with champagne flutes, nervously staring at the door, feeling the calm before the storm of humiliation.</p>
<p>The first man through the door was the picture of gluttony, he had a tent of expensive black cotton stretched into a vaguely tuxedo shape around his ample frame, topped with a Batman mask.</p>
<p>"Welcome, would you like some champagne?" Christine asked with a grin. The man eagerly took the flute before moving his lecherous eyes up and down her body.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much, do you know what type of champagne it is?" He asked.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I don't." Christine replied.</p>
<p>"Oh well, I suppose they don't hire you for your brains do they?" The fat man quipped, moving closer so he could cup Christine's breasts. "Boy the girls at the feast seem to get bustier every year. Although maybe it is time to change the diet..." The man moved on to jiggling Christine's bottom. "If my body was my bread and butter, I think I would eat less bread and butter."</p>
<p>It took every ounce of strength for Christine to control her rage at this human blimp criticising her ass for a bit of excess jiggle. Compared to the average woman she was very much a catch. As she gritted her teeth another couple of men entered to watch her humiliation.</p>
<p>"What do you think boys?" The fat man goaded, "would you put up with a little plump for tits this big?" The men all gathered as Christine handed them champagne and prepared herself for a parade of entitled wankers gearing up for a blow by blow account of her body's most minor flaws.</p>
<p>Luckily enough, as the party started to get going, the crowd thickened and the impatience of those at the back of the queue ensured they didn't spend a lot of time bullying Christine. There were still the gropes and the lecherous looks, but Christine managed to continue her mantra, that tonight she was a loser who deserves this, long enough not to punch anyone. Once the last of the men had arrived, Kipper handed Christine a tray and sent her to table one to start her shift of table service.</p>
<p>"Hello gentlemen, can I fetch any of you a drink?" She asked, forcing a big grin to crawl over her face.</p>
<p>"Typical!" Announced one of the older and more portly men wearing a Batman mask (Christine had noticed a majority of the men present were wearing Batman masks and choked it up to chronic lack of creativity among the toxically masculine)."Pay an arm and a leg for feast tickets and I get stuck on the table with the tubby waitress.</p>
<p>"Come on George, look at those tits, she's alright." One of the younger men interjected.</p>
<p>"Oh she's fine by regular girl standards, just like your wealthy by poor people standards. But look at the girls at the other tables, they're Kipper's best stock, you think their asses jiggle like this." He gave Christine's ass a hearty slap for the table to laugh at before ordering an obscenely expensive whiskey.</p>
<p>One by one Christine took the drink orders, each time she would get the measure of the man ordering based on whether they leerily cupped her breasts, or if they made horrible comments on her ass or belly, often while giving a degrading demonstration to the rest of the tables as the increasingly drunken men laughed at her degradation.</p>
<p>Christine's self-esteem was at Rock bottom when Kipper guided her towards the stage for the auction.</p>
<p>Christine waited with the other girls onstage, the humiliating comments about her body still ringing in her ears. She had seen men wider than they were tall comment that she was starting to let herself go and it filled her with rage. The one saving grace was that if this was how snobby they were about working girls, then there was no way they would bid high enough for her to have to fulfil any of those horrible bonus awards. Kipper took pride of place at the front and began to speak to the crowd.</p>
<p>"Good evening everyone, it's time for tonight's auction. Now I know there are a few new faces here tonight so let's go over the rules again. This is not a charity auction, the money raised goes into the girls pockets. As such we have no reason to encourage high bidding, we instead want to encourage a good time and an appropriate appreciation for the female form. So the bidding goes as follows: if you think a girl is the most sublime creature you have ever seen and end up bidding over $50,000, all you get is her bikini to keep. The less valuable the girl, the more you get for your money."</p>
<p>Christine's eyes widened. That sneaky asshole, he never said the bonuses were for lower bids. This was clearly designed as a means to humiliate the poor girls working for Kipper and now Christine was trapped.</p>
<p>"If the bidding stops under $25,000 you get a kiss, $10,000 a private dance, $5000 a hand job, $1000 a blow job, and if nobody here decides the girl you bid on is worth over $500, you get to take her to your room and fuck her." Christine could barely stand, all night she had been told how the other girls were better and now she was about to face horrible proof.</p>
<p>One at a time the previous girls walked on stage. Christine did not consider herself in the same league and was shocked to find bids struggling to reach above $10,000. At the drop of the hammer, each man walked up to the stage to collect their prize, leaving Christine more alone and exposed until she was the last girl remaining. Kipper called her up and she stood looking at the audience that held her fate, her lips visibly quivering. Kipper asked for opening bids and there was a second of dead silence.</p>
<p>"A dollar! A man in the front row shouted to guffaws around the room, Christine went red with rage and embarrassment. What happened next shook her to the very core.</p>
<p>"Any advance on one dollar?" Kipper chuckled.</p>
<p>"No I think we're good." A boisterous voice yelled from his seat.</p>
<p>All of a sudden every man present decided it would be funny not to bid any higher, Kipper tried to raise the bids but nobody was budging. He brought the hammer down and with it shattered any vestige of Christine's pride. She had just become a stranger's whore for a buck. A portly middle aged man in a Batman mask walked up to the stage, grinning ear to ear as he handed Kipper a dollar, then took Christine's hand and led her from the room, the men cheering as she left.</p>
<p>The man said nothing as he led Christine through the hotel and back to his room. He opened the door for her and as she walked in he locked it behind them.</p>
<p>"Alright, take off that bikini, let's see what I'm working with." He ordered. Christine hesitated and his smile turned to a sneer. "Listen whore, I know you're probably shaken finding out your flabby ass is only worth a dollar, but if I tell you to do something, you do it or I'll have Kipper throw you back in whatever budget strip club he fished you out of."</p>
<p>Christine went into a daze, nobody had ever talked to her like that, treated this millionaire like she was a worthless piece of meat. With shaking hands she unclasped the bikini top, letting it fall to the floor and her tits sway in freedom. The sneer turned back to a smile as she pulled down her bikini bottoms, standing naked but for a mask in front of the man who bought her.</p>
<p>"That's better." He announced, undoing his fly. "Now I want to get back to the feast so let's make this a quickie, for starters suck my cock like a good little whore and when I'm ready I want you to look up at me with those smokey bitch eyes and I want you to beg me to fuck you."</p>
<p>Slowly Christine knelt in front of the man, trying not to break down at what losing had reduced her to, his hard cock twitching with anticipation. She opened her mouth wide and felt his meat begin to fill her to her throat, rhythmically moving forwards and backwards as his hands wrapped themselves round the back of her head. Each time she tried to pull back she would feel his grip tighten and pull her deeper onto his dick, a light chuckle crawling out of his mouth every time she gagged at his cock hitting her throat. Eventually he pushed her backwards and announced.</p>
<p>"Alright, beg me, whore." Christine sat back and looked pleadingly at the man, swallowing all pride she meekly replied.</p>
<p>"Please fuck me?" Once again the sneer returned to the man's face.</p>
<p>"That's how you beg to be fucked? God, Kipper's standards are slipping. Do it properly. Bend over, pull apart those fat ass cheeks of yours and beg me to dirty my cock with your dollar store pussy." Christine stood up wide eyes turned around to look away from the man. She took a deep breath, clenched her fists, and remembered the sound of the coin ringing in the air.</p>
<p>Slowly she bent over, spreading herself for the horrible man who bought her, looking into his eyes from between her legs.</p>
<p>"Please... sir. Please could you fuck this cheap whore with your glorious cock? I want to feel your wealthy dick deep in my filthy one dollar cunt." Christine stammered out, watching the man stand up, roughly grab her by the hips, and aggressively thrust his penis into her. Christine took no pleasure from the minute of rampant thrusting that entailed and she wanted to retch when she felt his cock twitch and fill her with his disgusting sperm.</p>
<p>The man waited impatiently for Christine to put her bikini back on, the string thong doing very little to stop the cum dripping out of her pussy. She walked back to the feast hall in a daze, where Kipper decided she looked far too violated and degraded to continue her duties. He gave her a key to his hotel room and told her to go back and change.</p>
<p>Christine spent a lot of time looking at herself in the mirror, before showering and putting her clothes back on. Once she was dressed again, in her mind the bet was over, and the horrible experience she had just gone through was filed away at the back of her mind. Kipper was actually quite surprised to see how upbeat she was when he returned to the room.</p>
<p>"Hi Christine. Just thought I'd come here to give you your cut." He held out his hand with a single 50 cent piece in it. "I take 50% from all my girls, and you were working for me tonight, so here's your fifty cents."</p>
<p>"I don't want it." Christine retorted.</p>
<p>"I know." Kipper replied, pressing the coin into her hand. "But nevertheless you now have it. You can do whatever you want with that; get a chocolate bar, give it to charity, throw it in the ocean I don't care. But none of that will change the fact that tonight you were paid for sex. Wherever you go and whatever you do, you will now remember that you are a prostitute."</p>
<p>Kipper spent the next couple of days pulling together any dirt he had on Christine, certain that after the events of the Feast of Beasts, she would try to end the arrangement. He was dumbfounded when he read the email Christine sent to him about a week later.</p>
<p>"Dear Kipper,</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing that gambling opportunity to my attention, please let me know if any similar opportunities present themselves in the future. In the meantime, the next work event is in four days' time and I would like to organise another coin flip.</p>
<p>This time I will be providing the coin."</p>
<p>Over the next five years a lot changed for Christine, she had the contacts and funding needed to strike out on her own and as such became the CEO of her own company, Coinflip Investment Consultancy. As a consultant she met every person of influence in the financial world, expanded her circles greatly, and with it her company became the same boring safe profitable venture that all established firms eventually become.</p>
<p>The one constant in her life was the arrangement with Kipper. After the first Feast of Beasts Christine began dieting and hitting the gym even harder to keep her body on par with Starla's, which paid dividends when in the following feast she was auctioned for $15,000 and got away with giving a private dance to a mid-level investor she had spent the previous day berating for his risk averse portfolio. The next year she broke the mould to be part of the first group of female attenders of the Feast of Beasts, mainly so she could put in a bid on Starla at the auction. She bid $10 on her, and knowing what that entailed, the men let her take Starla back to her room and use a strap on to submit her to the same humiliating sex she had received two years prior.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>Outside the Feast of Beasts Christine kept pushing herself with the bets. Between them her and Starla had streaked more events, given more lap dances and exposed themselves to such a wide range of people that "the masked whore" was now a legend among her circles</p>
<p>With her legendary status came a new angle of flexibility in the arrangement. Before Christine could not prostitute herself as she would not have been able to explain why she needed to keep the mask on. Now she and Starla could flip a coin to see who had to fulfil the worst machinations of Kipper's clients who requested the legendary prostitute.</p>
<p>There were some innovations over the years as flipping the first 50¢ Christine had earned as a prostitute began to wear thin. They began betting on sporting events or meaningless things like whether an odd or even number of people turned up to watch the masked whore get a public whipping. Once at a charity casino night, Christine and Starla competed to see who could get the most chips in an hour, with the loser having to sleep with the highest roller of the night. Starla won by sitting and having a drink, watching as Christine put all her chips on red only to have them taken away by lucky 13.</p>
<p>It was after five years and a self-made success not dependent on anyone that Christine felt comfortable enough to push her boundaries further. It was during the summer holidays, when the jetsetters buzzing around the world made conferences few and far between, so Christine felt the itch for risk even more intensely. She was waiting in Kipper's room with Starla, due to flip a coin to see whose naked body would be photographed for that year's Feast of Beasts invitations.</p>
<p>"How are you doing today Starla?" Christine asked.</p>
<p>"I'm alright." She replied with a sigh, leading Christine to give her a friendly nudge to prompt her further. "I know most people would kill to be in my position, $125,000 a year to do half a job is nothing to be sniffed at, but it does take away a lot of my freedom."</p>
<p>"How so?" Christine asked.</p>
<p>"Well I have to keep my hair brunette and long, can't get any of the piercings or tattoos I want, can't let myself go or get too buff, can't take a holiday because a bet may come in. I don't want to give up this sweet deal but sometimes I get tired of being you." Christine thought on this for a moment, then leapt up and grabbed a piece of paper and a pen. By the time Kipper arrived Christine thrust the list into his hands.</p>
<p>First flip: heads, we keep our hair long and brunette. Tails, Starla decides our new hairstyle.</p>
<p>Second flip: heads, nothing happens. Tails we get a matching tattoo (Starla's choice).</p>
<p>Third flip: heads, nothing happens. Tails we get matching piercings (Starla's choice).</p>
<p>Fourth flip: heads Starla and I have the same gym regimen for the month (Starla's choice). Tails, Starla and I are banned from the gym and must eat takeaway every day for a month.</p>
<p>Fifth flip: heads, nothing happens. Tails, I pay for Starla to go on holiday for two weeks while I take over all her duties.</p>
<p>Sixth flip: heads, nothing happens. Tails, Kipper starts the rumour that the masked whore is actually a wealthy lady paying for humiliation.</p>
<p>Bonus flip if the above is tails: heads, nothing happens. Tails, I appear unmasked on the invitations to the Feast of Beasts.</p>
<p>Kipper read the page intently, while Christine looked on with wild chaos in her eyes. Finally he looked up at Christine and simply said,</p>
<p>"Hand me your coin."</p>
<p>Starla found out after Kipper what was happening and couldn't believe her eyes as her boss tossed the coin into the air for the first time.</p>
<p>"Heads, I'm afraid you're stuck with long brunette hair." He announced, giving Starla and Christine long enough to relish the moment before once again tossing the coin into the air.</p>
<p>"Heads again. Sorry Starla, this isn't your night." Christine was reeling, she was putting it all on the line and was still coming out on top, although it was the later flips that worried her. Her stomach somersaulted with the coin as it was once again tossed in the air.</p>
<p>"Tails, finally. So Starla, think about what you want pierced." Christine's first loss and her stomach sank, she started to wonder where on her body would end up threaded with tacky jewellery but was interrupted by the coin once again flying into the air.</p>
<p>"Heads, I'm not going to say I'm sad my highest earning girl doesn't have to get fat." Kipper acknowledged, while Christine wondered what kind of gym regimen Starla had in mind. Sensing that the next two coin flips were the most climactic Kipper gave a slight pause before flipping the coin into the air again.</p>
<p>"Tails," he announced. "Well it looks like we're going to have to make some arrangements after this." Christine's heart dropped, two weeks of being a whore. Kipper decided to give that a moment to sink in, before gearing up for the grand finale coin flip. The coin whistled through the sky and he snatched it out of the air.</p>
<p>"Tails, I promise to be subtle, and take appropriate measures to make sure nobody takes the mask off while Starla is on holiday, but in no time at all, everyone is going to be wondering who the masked whore is. That is unless this next coin comes up tails." Kipper announced, lining up to toss the coin again. Suddenly he paused. "Hold on, I've had an idea. You told me it's the uncertainty and risk you like, so how about we stretch that out some more. How about we flip your coin, but you don't see the result. Later, at the photoshoot we take two pictures of you, one with the mask and one without. You will find out whether our coin flip was heads or tails when you receive your invitation in the post.</p>
<p>Christine thought about it, this could mean weeks, maybe even months of that familiar tingle of risk when the coin is in the air, living her day to day life knowing that at any moment her naked truth could be landing on her co-workers doorsteps. She couldn't agree fast enough.</p>
<p>Kipper tossed the coin in the air. The world ground to a halt, the ringing in Christine's ears a harbinger of her total and final humiliation. Her heart beat a mile a minute while her lungs strained to hold onto every ounce of breath in them, Kipper grabbed the coin and showed the result to Starla, their grins grew and Christine had no idea.</p>
<p>Christine got home from work to find the usual pile of post on her doormat. She was not concentrating as lots had been happening recently. The rumour had turned into a firestorm of speculation, everyone wanted to figure out who the masked whore was. At one point she found out about a betting pool among the men and her heart fluttered to see she was in the top three shortest odds. Tonight of all nights her mind was a whirr of dark thoughts, Starla was currently on a plane to Ibiza and she had to get ready for her first shift as a week-long prostitute. But as she tossed the pile of post to one side she noticed a thick black envelope, with her name and address written in fine gold calligraphy, she instantly recognised this as an invite to the Feast of Beasts. The ringing in her ears returned as she slid a finger under the envelope.</p>
<p>She opened the envelope to see her naked body on a bed of feathers, her newly pierced nipples and clit on full display. As she moved her eyes up her body, she eventually looked into her own eyes, and sighed with relief to see her mask in place. She pinned the invite to her notice board and continued getting ready for her first night of fucking strangers for money.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks working two jobs, Christine was exhausted. Each night had found her at a different wealthy penthouse, selling her body to men who wanted to feel like they were violating someone they knew. Kipper had carefully screened the clients to people he had dirt on so every John knew a dire punishment was waiting if they took off Christine's mask.</p>
<p>This didn't stop men from speculating. For three of the clients, they decided to call Christine by another woman's name the whole time they were fucking her, the minute chance they were right providing a unique fetish for Christine to indulge. Needless to say those particular clients did not treat Christine well and Christine was always disappointed that none of the clients who indulged this fantasy had correctly guessed her identity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Christine was relieved to hear Starla was back in the country and she would get her evenings back for relaxation. She had decided that after two weeks of being a whore she had earned a break and that she wouldn't do anything again until the Feast of Beasts in a month's time. Soaking in a bath thinking about the life Starla was back to, she felt relief at not having to prostitute herself out any more. It was the most degrading two weeks of her life and she was not in a hurry to relive it.</p>
<p>After a week of evenings to herself, Christine's mind began to wander again. The Feast of Beasts was approaching and although she was still feeling the effects of her last gamble, she was eager to keep pushing herself, the rumours surrounding the masked whore heightening the scale of the risk and the anticipation of the high from walking that tightrope. Christine opened a word document and began to plan.</p>
<p>Two weeks later she attached the document to an email and sent it to Kipper.</p>
<p>The Feast of Beasts had been a raucous affair as always, the festival of scantily clad women delighting the crowd of those too wealthy for manners or restraint.</p>
<p>The masked whore was on everybody's minds and lips. She had appeared on the invite so everyone assumed she must be coming, but there was no sign of her among the waiting staff. Even more cryptically, each place setting had a piece of paper on it with the question 'Who do you think is the masked whore? Write your answer below and hand this slip to the waitress.'</p>
<p>Pudding was finished and the guests were drinking aperitifs, wondering why the auction was so delayed, when a Kipper took to the stage.</p>
<p>"Honoured guests!" He announced, "Tonight we have an extra special presentation just for you. So first some background, I'm sure you have all heard rumours of the masked whore working at one of your companies. Well it is true, and tonight she's willing to put everything on the line just for the thrill of it. So once again please welcome back to the Feast of Beasts, the masked whore!"</p>
<p>From behind the curtain, Christine emerged pushing a table on wheels. She was wearing all the accoutrements of a dancer from Las Vegas; the white feathered headdress extending down her head into her mask, with a matching feather bustle cascading from her garter belt down the small of her back. All she was missing was any items of clothing to cover her body. A small camera pointing down on the table activated, projecting onto the wall behind a simple roulette wheel.</p>
<p>"Our masked whore here has designed a lovely game to gauge how clever she has been at keeping her identity secret." Kipper announced taking out a bag filled with slips of paper. "I'm going to go through your guesses one at a time, each time I pull out a piece of paper with the masked whore's real name on it, we're going to take a spin on the roulette wheel to see what happens to her." Next to the projection of wheel, the first of Christine's punishments appeared:</p>
<p>Red: Kipper reveals an embarrassing fact.</p>
<p>Black: put a dildo in your pussy.</p>
<p>0: all or nothing.</p>
<p>"You may be wondering what 'all or nothing' means. Well if 0 comes up on the roulette wheel, the masked whore is going to flip a coin. Heads and she wins, the game is over and she retreats to a changing room backstage. Tails and she takes off her mask and we play a far more punishing game." The guests murmured about the possibilities ahead of them, Christine gulped at the huge risk she was taking, and Kipper began removing paper from the bag, letting Christine watch as he opened each one in turn.</p>
<p>Christine had prepared this with the memory of the betting pool fresh in her mind. There were at least 20 women on that list and she was riding high at 5 to 1 odds. The guest list for the Feast of Beasts was around a hundred people so if everything tracked her name would be pulled about 20 times, making all or nothing likely but not certain. It was a bad sign when the second piece of paper Kipper pulled had her name on it.</p>
<p>The roulette wheel spun and with every click of the ball bearing Christine's heart skipped a beat. 25, red.</p>
<p>"Fun fact, this lady paid $250,000 to be humiliated, she doesn't even enjoy humiliation she enjoys the risk, like the world's sluttiest Daredevil." Christine felt her heart sink having everyone know the details of her arrangement, even if she did write the embarrassing facts herself. As the audience laughter died down, Kipper pulled out another piece of paper and showed it to Christine, her name almost jumping off the paper and slapping her in the face.</p>
<p>"At this rate we won't need to remove her mask, everybody clearly already knows who you are." Kipper quipped as he spun the roulette wheel again. 10, black.</p>
<p>Christine unclipped the bustle from the garter belt to stop the feathers getting in the way before reaching through the curtain under the table and pulling out a red glittery dildo. She looked out over the audience while she squatted down and eased the phallus into her pussy, letting out a degraded moan. The display updated.</p>
<p>Red: Kipper reveals an embarrassing fact.</p>
<p>Black: put a butt plug in your ass.</p>
<p>0: all or nothing.</p>
<p>Christine awkwardly stood next to Kipper as he pulled more paper out of the bag, to her relief there were a few more incorrect guesses before she saw her name again. Her eyes went wide as she saw the ball bump into the 0 buffer, before just filling over into 32, red.</p>
<p>"Fun fact: the masked whore was worth millions of dollars when she first sold her body for sex. Her client paid a single dollar." Christine's blush was noticeable as Kipper continued to pull out slips of paper. Sooner than she thought Christine was once again spinning the wheel. 22, black.</p>
<p>Christine had done bits and pieces of butt stuff during her time as the masked whore but not enough to be used to it. She pulled out a butt plug her co-workers would consider moderate, but that was the largest Christine had ever taken. As she slowly slid it inside of her with one hand, the other holding the dildo in place, the screen updated again.</p>
<p>Red: Kipper reveals an embarrassing fact.</p>
<p>Black: pound your pussy with the dildo until you cum.</p>
<p>0: all or nothing.</p>
<p>Christine was taking longer than first thought with the butt plug so Kipper went ahead and continued pulling out slips of paper. The butt plug had barely slotted into place as Christine saw Kipper dangling another slip with her name on it. The ball was released again into the roulette wheel and once again Christine squirmed with humiliation and dread. 4, black.</p>
<p>For the first time in the night the crowd's stunned silence was replaced with a cheer. People began to share their guesses, trying to work out Christine's identity based on how often her name was getting pulled. Meanwhile Christine walked to the edge of the stage and sat down, giving the crowd a clear view of her pussy as she began to slide the dildo in and out of her, her heavy breathing beginning to turn into light moans as Kipper continued with his task and the display updated.</p>
<p>Red: Kipper reveals an embarrassing fact.</p>
<p>Black: pick the largest audience member to give a blow job to.</p>
<p>0: all or nothing.</p>
<p>This time there was more of a wait before the next correct guess was pulled. Leading many to conclude that the masked whore had just had a run of bad luck even though she had not brought herself to cum yet, Kipper decided for the sake of brevity to spin the wheel. 12, red.</p>
<p>"Fun fact: in case you were wondering what this whore does with the money she earns fucking her co-workers, she keeps it for masked whore expenses such as those piercings and tonight's outfit."</p>
<p>Christine continued to pound her pussy, feeling herself coming close to climaxing despite the humiliating facts and gawking faces. She closed her eyes as tight as possible and felt a wave of pleasure hit her body. When she opened her eyes again Kipper was holding another sheet of paper with her name on. The roulette wheel spun and instead of having a moment to catch her breath, Christine was once again getting her high from the risk of what was coming. As the ball spun Christine stood up, leaving the dildo on the floor, the butt plug still churning inside of her. 16, red.</p>
<p>"Fun fact, when she's at home alone and wants to get in the mood for masturbation, the masked whore looks up videos of herself on porn websites."</p>
<p>Christine was regaining her composure and chanced a look at the bag of names, it was only about half empty, the thought of this being the halfway point filled her with a dread, a dread that only intensified as Kipper pulled out her name again and spun the wheel. The ball once again followed its course, pre-set by physics when Kipper released it only for Christine to await her pre-determined fate. Christine's stomach dropped through the floor as the result she had been dreading came up, 0.</p>
<p>The crowd went wild as Christine took her coin from a smiling Kipper, but for Christine the world was silent, this was the coin toss to end all coin tosses, gambling without a net. As the coin flew into the air, she knew that her life would change forever if she didn't see a face when she opened her hand.</p>
<p>The audience's cheers turned to an intense silence as the masked whore caught the coin and stared into her hand. Everyone tried desperately to discern the result from her response, her body language, and emotions that could be gleaned through the mask. The masked whore turned to the audience, and with quivering hands, reached to the back of her head and gripped the base of her mask. Her lips visibly quivering as she lifted it from her face and dropped it to her side.</p>
<p>"I am Christine Andrews, and I am the masked whore!" She yelled to the baying crowd of her friends and colleagues. A single tear ran unnoticed down her cheek. Kipper waited for the crowd to calm down before stepping forward to continue the evening.</p>
<p>"Now we did mention a more punishing game if our masked whore were unmasked. After all, we still have about half a bag of names to go through here. So let's update the forfeits." The screen changed:</p>
<p>Red: Christine reveals an embarrassing fact about herself.</p>
<p>Black: Christine goes to work naked for a week.</p>
<p>0: Christine quits her job to become a full time whore.</p>
<p>There was genuine shock among the crowd as a look of dread crossed Christine's face, now apparent to all. Kipper pulled out a few names before stopping to show Christine her name and spinning the roulette wheel. 30, red. Instead of Kipper reading out the fun fact, now Christine was reading them, adding to her humiliation as she revealed embarrassing truths to the audience.</p>
<p>"Fun fact, there have been eight separate occasions where someone has paid less than $10 to fuck me." She announced. Kipper pulled another slip out of the bag and immediately spun the wheel again, clearly Christine was not as good at hiding her identity as she thought. 26, black.</p>
<p>"Well done anyone who works for Christine or has meetings with her next week." Kipper announced as Christine sighed. The board updated.</p>
<p>Red: Christine reveals an embarrassing fact about herself.</p>
<p>Black: in every golf tournament for a year, a fuck from Christine will be the prize for winning.</p>
<p>0: Christine quits her job to become a full time whore.</p>
<p>Christine continued to pace nervously as Kipper pulled out a few more slips, drawing Christine's name again and spinning the wheel. 13, black.</p>
<p>Christine began to feel feint, she had picked the worst possible punishments for herself, cocky that she would never have to do them, and now she had signed up to be violated over the year by whichever posh prick was the best at knocking a ball into a hole that week. The board updated.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Red: Christine reveals an embarrassing fact about herself.</p>
<p>Black: Christine to burn all of her clothes and shoes. For a year she may only wear things thrown away by prostitutes working for Kipper.</p>
<p>0: Christine quits her job to become a full time whore.</p>
<p>Christine had forgotten about that forfeit, her mind buzzed with all the expensive clothes and carefully picked outfits that would go up in flames. All she could do was stand naked and watch as Kipper continued to pull names from the bag. He was down to the last dozen or so when Christine's name appeared and the ball was once again sent spinning around the wheel. 33, black.</p>
<p>Christine completely disassociated at the sight of yet another black, it was the only way she could stay sane at all the changes to her life that appeared to be coming at once. Her wandering mind also kept her from remembering the next thing she foolishly decided should go on the board.</p>
<p>Red: Christine reveals an embarrassing fact about herself.</p>
<p>Black: Christine legally changes her name to "A Dumb Whore" for a year.</p>
<p>0: Christine quits her job to become a full time whore.</p>
<p>Christine stared at the audience, her mouth dropping open as Kipper delighted in continuing the destruction of anything that gave Christine a sense of self-esteem. He didn't even taunt Christine as he pulled out another slip with her name on it and spun the wheel. 27, red. Christine was in too much of a daze to react so Kipper ended up nudging her to bring her back to reality, handing her a note with a pre-prepared fact on it.</p>
<p>"Before the arrangement with Kipper, I had never had anything put up my ass, I have now had several butt plugs and two cocks pushed into my anus." She announced, her words bringing the world into focus and breaking her disassociation. Kipper held up the bag, five slips of paper remained and he was eager to get a countdown going.</p>
<p>"Five!" He yelled "nope, this guy thought it was the HR manager at JF Banking. Four! I know her, she's in her late 40's you weirdo. Three! Oh dear Christine, another shrewd observer." The countdown stopped and once again the whirlwind of humiliation began on the roulette wheel again. 35, black.</p>
<p>Christine cradled her head in her hands, even though all the punishments were effectively self-inflicted, it didn't stop a pang of guilt beginning to circle the audience at the woman whose life was being destroyed in front of their eyes. When Christine's head raised again and revealed she was laughing uncontrollably, guilt turned to concern. Of course she knew what she had written as the next black forfeit.</p>
<p>Red: Christine reveals an embarrassing fact about herself.</p>
<p>Black: Christine pays for everyone in the audience to get a unique watch. Anyone wearing that watch is allowed to do any of the following things to Christine for a whole year:</p>
<p>Pull her hair</p>
<p>Spit in her face</p>
<p>Spank her ass</p>
<p>0: Christine quits her job to become a full time whore.</p>
<p>The audience was agape as Christine turned to Kipper and began egging him on to pull out the last two slips. He pulled out the first one and her face lit up to see her name on it. Kipper had barely acknowledged that before Christine grabbed the ball out of his hand and spun it, eager to see where the ball would land. 1, red.</p>
<p>"OK, embarrassing fact." Christine thought to herself. "Here we go, fun fact, I'm such a stupid and cocky whore, I didn't prepare enough fun facts for the amount of people who guessed it was me. So if we get another roll and it comes up red I will double the length of time all the black punishments apply for." Even Kipper was getting worried now, Christine had become crazed and was staring intently at the last slip in the bag. Kipper pulled it out and showed it to Christine.</p>
<p>"Serena Rosso?" Christine yelled. "You thought boring old Serena was the masked whore? God, one of you is a moron." She slumped dejectedly for a second before having an idea.</p>
<p>"Hey Kipper," she shouted, grabbing a piece of paper and a pen, "there's still one person who attended the feast that you didn't ask to guess the identity of the masked whore. Me!" She threw her piece of paper into the bag and looked at Kipper imploringly to pick it out. Kipper hadn't even opened the paper when Christine had already spun the wheel, her eyes wildly darting around the circumference to follow the ball's path. 24, black.</p>
<p>"24 black everyone!" Christine announced. "That means you get a watch, and you get a watch, everybody gets a watch!" She yelled dancing in front of the stunned crowd. "My name is Christine Andrews and I have been the masked whore, goodnight everyone!" She screamed as she ran backstage.</p>
<p>The bulk of the workers at Coinflip Investments didn't understand why the board of directors were looking a mixture of excited and uncertain on a Monday morning. The higher-ups kept an eye on the door, wondering if Christine was going to follow through on what she had agreed to in her madness at the feast of Beasts. There was a ding that heralded the arrival of the lift from the parking garage, and as the doors parted, Christine was stood, hands on hips, legs apart in a prime power pose with not a stitch of clothing on her.</p>
<p>This was certainly a shock to the board of directors, but at least they were prepared unlike the rest of the workers at Coinflip Investments, the office erupted into total chaos as Christine calmly walked past the row of desks and into her office, her breasts swaying with each step allowing her piercings to catch the light and add a level of surprise to the unprepared.</p>
<p>As she sat behind her desk, her director of communications let himself into her office and closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ Christine I didn't think you would go through with it." He exploded.</p>
<p>"Firstly David, no matter what state of dress I am in, my office does not have an open door policy. Secondly my name is no longer Christine." She stated, revealing the new plaque for her door the read 'Adum Hoare, Managing Director.' "We had to spell my new name that way as New York doesn't allow obscene name changes, but Adum is an obscure derivation of Adam and Hoare spelt that way is a well-known surname."</p>
<p>Her director of communications was reeling, this was a disaster that he would have to clear up.</p>
<p>"So you're actually going through with this, with everything?" He asked dumbfounded.</p>
<p>"When anyone in our firm makes a promise I expect then to keep it, no exceptions. I burnt all my clothes last night and currently all I have is a falling apart lace dressing gown for when I am not at work." David in stunned silence as there was a knock at the door, an awkward looking Fed Ex man edged his way into the room.</p>
<p>"Is someone here Adum Hoare?" He asked, trying to maintain his professionalism in front of the naked woman behind the desk.</p>
<p>"I'm Adum Hoare," Christine Chirped, taking the package from his hands. "Oh good, the first pack of specially made watches are here, along with a guest list from the Feast of Beasts. Look David here's yours." Christine handed David his watch with a nonchalant grin. David took a moment to consider what was happening then came to a decision.</p>
<p>"OK, if that's how it's going to be let's do it your way." He mused, attaching the watch to his wrist. Once he was wearing his watch, he grabbed Christine by the hair and pulled her towards him so her face was right in front of his. "I'm not letting some horny bitch railroad my career, I quit" he let go of her hair, and then spat in her face before turning and leaving.</p>
<p>"Sorry to hear that David." Christine responded, not even slightly perturbed by what had just occurred.</p>
<p>In the week she spent naked at the a lot changed for Christine, for every worker that left in disgust, there were a couple who stayed despite her new found eccentricity and a couple more who discovered a new found love for their job. As for clients it was once again a mixed bag, some clients did not want a pervert managing their finances, whereas others were happy to have an investment consultant they could spank and spit on if they didn't like her advice.</p>
<p>It was known that she would only be naked for the week, so disappointment turned to surprise when on Monday she arrived in a short tight leopard print dress with a large seaman stain on the front. A dress it was very apparent that she was not wearing underwear with. It became clear that their boss's degradation was going to be a long term arrangement. Interestingly enough, although Christine was not a fan of becoming Adum Hoare, it did make her day to day business dealings far more of a challenge, convincing clients to take your investment advice while doing everything in your power to ensure nobody had any respect for her.</p>
<p>It was after a month that Adum Hoare and her team popped the champagne in her office, they had somehow convinced enough big name clients to stay to keep the business afloat. Christine was surrounded by her board of directors, wearing incredibly short booty shorts with a crotch wearing very thin, and a pink high cut crop top that was meant to be cut high enough to show off plenty of underboob but after the third time it rode up Christine just accepted her tits were going to be on display.</p>
<p>"Good to know the company is safe." Her finance director cheered, leerily looking up and down her body. "You know we should reward the workers. How about you do another week naked."</p>
<p>"You know you're pretty hot yourself Lin." Christine replied. "Maybe if you went naked for just a day it would really perk up the workers." Her finance director looked worried for a second. "I'll tell you what, how about we flip a coin?"</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Starla took all the money she made being the other masked whore and invested it in a series of nightclubs. Despite no formal training it turned out she had a head for the business and ended up being a self-made millionaire.</p>
<p>Kipper was a bit upset with the loss of his easiest paycheck but his place in the inner circle was secured, he enjoyed a few years of the good life before he was arrested on some very minor charges by feds looking for an inside man. He "committed suicide" one day before he was due to go into witness protection.</p>
<p>Christine (nee Adum Hoare) continued to gamble with her body, expanding her arrangement to a wide variety of members of the business community, she even briefly mentored another masked whore, who actually had the good sense to quit while she was ahead. Eventually, when she felt she had pushed every boundary she thought possible, she got help for her gambling addiction and retired wealthy and fulfilled.</p>
