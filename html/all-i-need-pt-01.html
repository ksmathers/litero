<p>Author's Note:</p>
<p>All characters are at least 18 in this story. There is incest and graphic sexual content, if that's not your thing, then you have been forewarned.</p>
<p>This story does not dive straight into the incest. There is some build up. If you are looking for a quick fix, this may not be the right choice. This is my first attempt at writing anything and I hope readers enjoy it. Constructive feedback is appreciated. Special Thanks to Cliffhangingtom for providing valuable feedback. This is a fairly long story, at least five parts, but it is 99% completed at the time of this writing. You will not be left with an unfinished story. I plan to upload the remaining parts of the story soon.</p>
<p>Part One.</p>
<p>I dragged the thin brush handle jaggedly across the canvas, leaving behind a rough gash of red on the black background. I then went to work on elaborately highlighting the areas of red that I wanted to appear more strongly and blending the ones I wanted to fade. The song pounding in my headphones helping elicit the image I was working on from my mind's eye. Some of the lyrics stuck in my head on a loop, even though the song kept going.</p>
<p>"You cry out in your sleep</p>
<p>All my failings exposed</p>
<p>And there's a taste in my mouth</p>
<p>As desperation takes hold "</p>
<p>This happened sometimes when I was painting, and focusing on snippets of lines that resonated with me just added to the mood I hoped to convey. I had no lofty illusions about the paintings I created. I wasn't pretentious about it and didn't try to convince people there was some deep meaning associated with them about the evils of society or any of that other shit that the local art community tried to tack onto each others' work. The artwork I produced was primarily abstract images. Collections of textures, swirls, and shadows that I hoped, at best, made someone have some sort of emotional response to. At worst, I hoped that they would think they were somewhat interesting. If they got something else from it than what I had tried to convey, then so be it. It didn't matter to me at all. I created art simply because I enjoyed it and I always had from the time I was a child. It was somewhat cathartic for me, and I was at my most productive with it when some heartbreak or tension entered my life. I didn't care much about making money with it and I wasn't foolish enough to believe that I was going to make a living as an artist.</p>
<p>I was 20 years old, midway through my second year of college when I dropped out for the semester in complete frustration with the art program. Unsure what else to do with my life for the moment, I was dividing my time between painting on my own and working at a local mom and pop music store that was barely hanging on. The recent popularity surge of vinyl sales were proving to be it's saving grace. I planned to return to college in the Fall, but was unsure if I would continue with the visual arts program or settle into something infinitely more boring.</p>
<p>I switched brushes and continued blending crimson orbs out of the black background, applying layer after layer of red on the canvas. It usually took multiple layers, but the finished effect really did look like the image was rising from the depths of the background. An unexpected hand on my shoulder broke my concentration and startled me so much that I almost dropped the plate I was using as a pallet.</p>
<p>"Dinner's ready, jackass." My sister smirked down at me where I was crouched, her dark hair falling down past her shoulders.</p>
<p>"Christ, Amy." I pulled the earbuds from my ears. "You scared the shit out of me."</p>
<p>"That explains the smell in here." She replied, looking pleased with herself.</p>
<p>"I'll be down in a few minutes, just need to clean this up real quick." I rolled my eyes at her quip and began rinsing off the brushes I'd used.</p>
<p>She turned and walked to the doorway. I instinctively glanced up at her ass as she walked away. In my mind, I fell to my knees and praised the heavens every day for whoever invented yoga pants. Even though her shirt was long enough to cover most of her shapely butt, I could see the lower half of it peek out with every step. I wasn't one to ogle every female form that moved, but an incredible ass was an incredible ass. My sister had one, and I suspected she knew it. I was always aware that she was my sister and felt appropriately guilty for even noticing. I knew I shouldn't have. But this was purely that male instinct, whatever old remnants of our lizard brains that just would not let us not notice a great ass. I stared longer than I intended to, as I reflected on my lizard brain, and suddenly realized the ass had left the room. I was staring at an empty doorway. Chastising myself, I shook my head.</p>
<p>I went to the bathroom and washed up, making sure I didn't get paint all over the dining room table. My mother didn't have a sense of humor about those sorts of things. I looked in the mirror and realized how tired I looked. I stood around 5'9" with short, dark brown hair that was nearly black, light brown eyes, and a slender build. I wasn't athletic in the traditional sense, but years of skateboarding had kept me in reasonably good shape. It had also left me with a variety of small scars from falls and a bad knee that was occasionally starting to give me trouble. I sighed and headed downstairs for dinner.</p>
<p>Mom handed me a plate of food and I settled in at the dining table to eat. Amy sat across from me, tinkering with her phone as she chewed. I could only assume she was texting with her dickhead boyfriend, Jeff. I had known about Jeff by reputation around campus and he struck me as a shady asshole, hence me calling him a dickhead. But, to be fair, he had been alright to my sister in the month or so they'd been going out. That didn't mean I had to like him, but what she did was her business. My dad ate in the living room in front of the TV, watching a football game. I briefly pondered why I'd been born without whatever gene it was that made sports interesting to people. Unless you considered skateboarding to be a sport, I never had any use for them, myself. I wondered sometimes if my father would have taken more interest in my life if I were a sports nut like himself, but it didn't particularly bother me that he didn't by the time I had reached high school. He showered attention on my sister whenever she had any kind of school activity going on, which made it painfully obvious who was the favored child.</p>
<p>A few minutes into the meal, my phone vibrated in my pocket. It was a text from Megan. "Hey, here's that album you asked about." The messaged was accompanied by a link. I smiled and clicked the link to download it.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Meg. I really appreciate it." I sent back.</p>
<p>A few moments passed. "How much did you appreciate it?"</p>
<p>I looked at the text and smiled again. I knew this game well. "Enough to remember it next time I see you."</p>
<p>Amy noticed me smiling at my phone and rolled her eyes a bit, trying to get a rise out of me. I ignored her bait. I think sisters sometimes just feel a need to start shit. Hell, I suppose brothers do, too. I'd certainly started my fair share with her. I looked back down at my phone as it vibrated again.</p>
<p>"Good, that's what I wanted to hear."</p>
<p>Then came another text. "Laura's gone home for the weekend. I really don't want to be alone tonight. Is that okay? Can you come by later?"</p>
<p>I thought about it a moment, picturing Megan's naked body against mine. I didn't have anything going on tonight, and it had been a couple of weeks since I'd last slept with her. Meg was a short, slender girl with smallish breasts, a decent ass, and a pixie haircut. Her hair color seemed to change every other week, it's natural color being something of a mystery to me although probably a mouse brown if I were to guess based on the color of her bush. She was cute, but she was one of the more emotionally draining people to be around that I had met in a long while. She was a photography major at the university and hung out around all the pretentious art snob types that grated on every nerve that I possessed. Still, when presented with the option of getting laid or not getting laid, the choice seemed pretty obvious.</p>
<p>"Sure, that's fine. I'll be by there as soon as I can break free of this place."</p>
<p>"Cool. See you in a bit."</p>
<p>After dinner, I took a quick shower, grabbed my backpack and drove to Megan's.</p>
<p>Megan opened the door and hugged me on the spot. Her hair was a deep shade of red tonight. It contrasted heavily against her pale, almost to the point of translucent, skin. She was wearing a long silk bathrobe with a floral print that she'd found in a Goodwill somewhere. It clung to her slim body as she moved, accentuating the fact that it was very likely all that she had on. I could see the outlines of her nipple rings clearly on the fabric.</p>
<p>"Hi, Adam," she sighed with her arms around my neck. "I've missed you."</p>
<p>"Good to see you, Meg." I replied as I dropped my bag by the door and shut the door with my foot.</p>
<p>Meg smiled into my shoulder as she pulled me back toward the bedroom. "It feels like forever that I've been waiting for you."</p>
<p>As soon as we got to her room, the robe hit the floor and I discovered that I was correct. She was naked beneath it. Although I'd seen her naked many times, I still had to pause and smile every time, taking in her soft curves and admiring how some of her tattoos fit to the contours of her shape. She glanced up at me shyly for a moment, then hugged me. The whole room smelled of sandalwood as she'd clearly been burning the stuff again.</p>
<p>"You can melt hearts with that look, you know." She muttered as she began planting kisses on my collarbone. I picked her up, while her arms were still wrapped around my neck and set her on the bed. She chuckled as I paused to kick my shoes off, before climbing in to join her.</p>
<p>"Did you miss me, Adam?" She asked, "It's been a while."</p>
<p>"Of course I did," I replied as I began kissing her stomach, torn on which direction to I wanted to head. Ultimately, I went up and kissed my way up between her breasts to her neck.</p>
<p>She ran her hands down my sides, clutching at me, finally grabbing my faded Aphex Twin shirt and yanking it over my head. One hand wrapped around my rib cage while the other slid down and rubbed my rapidly hardening cock through the fabric my pants. I felt her lips on my throat again, as she licked her way up my chin and sucked seductively on my bottom lip. She drew her knees up and parted them, pulling me toward her.</p>
<p>I broke our embrace long enough to pull off my pants and climb back in the bed. She rolled me on my back and I pushed myself up toward the headrest. Megan lowered her head to my cock and kissed it. Taking it in her hand, she licked my shaft in one continuous motion all the way to the tip before taking me in her mouth. I involuntarily took a sharp breath, my pulse quickening. She bobbed her head up and down a few times, swirling her tongue around the head before she moved to kissing my stomach. I had my hand upturned, dragging my fingertips down her body as she climbed me. She kissed her way up my chest to my throat, her breath becoming more harsh and raspy as she went.</p>
<p>When she straddled my hips, I slid my hand across her thigh and cupped her trimmed bush in my palm. She took a sharp intake of breath, and pushed herself against my hand as my fingers traced the outline of her sex with my fingertips. Her head settled against my neck, exhaling rapidly in my ear. After a few moments, she swatted my hand away and laid down beside me.</p>
<p>"Hurry up," she moaned as she tossed me a condom. I unwrapped it and put it on quickly. She moved to straddle me and positioned me over her entrance. We both gasped as I entered her. She rocked herself up and down on my dick, gasps increasing in tempo and volume. Her back arched away from me as she placed her arms on the wall above my head. I cupped her ass in my hands as I thrust into her, feeling her warmth envelope me. She moaned aloud as I hooked my the tip of my tongue through one of her nipple rings and tugged lightly.</p>
<p>Even through the obnoxious filter of the condom, I could feel the sense of urgency in Megan's movements. It had been a couple of weeks since I'd last come over, after all, and apparently she was horny as hell. Maybe some of her other toys had been busy lately as well. I felt the tingling sensation that warned me I was getting close and I was about to change positions in a potential bid to last longer when I heard the urgent moans in Megan's voice telling me that she was getting the same memo.</p>
<p>As her orgasm overtook her, she gripped me tightly with her legs and I could feel her thighs quivering against mine from the strain. That was all it took and I launched round after round of sperm in vain against the wall of the condom. She collapsed into me, as we both struggled to catch our breath.</p>
<p>"Thank you," she mumbled into my chest.</p>
<p>We were lying naked on her bed. I was propped up against her headboard and she laid on her back across me with her head resting on my stomach. Her dark red hair damp with sweat, tiny smears of hair dye marked the edge of her hairline. She lazily smoked a cigarette, tapping the ashes into the tray she had resting on her hip. I found myself looking at the series of scars along her forearms, some more raised than others. All of them old and long healed. And self inflicted. She tried to keep them hidden under a variety of bracelets that she had adorning both arms. She had similar scars on her upper thighs that I sometimes kissed, which usually produced a positive response from her. Her scars brought about a sense of melancholy in me sometimes, but I was glad she was in a better place now than when she had created them. If she noticed me looking at them, she said nothing.</p>
<p>"You know there's a show coming up in a few months?" She asked me, as she stared at the ceiling.</p>
<p>"I heard about it. Another one of those local artist showcase things. You gonna be in it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. You could get in on it if you wanted. I have the curator's number here." She glanced up at me and smiled.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I'm not sure I could handle having to be around all that. I can't stand those kinds of things. You know that." I had my hand resting on her shoulder, but let it slide down her chest and started absently playing with the captive bead on her nipple ring. She had small breasts that were nice and inviting. I was fond of teasing her nipple rings with my tongue and never seemed to tire of watching her nipples harden under my touch.</p>
<p>"I know you don't. But it could be a good way for more people to see your stuff. And it's a group show. You'd only have four or five pieces in it. I think they are only allowing for 8 feet per artist." She offered the cigarette to me, but I waved it away. She knew I didn't smoke, but offered all the time anyway. I had long suspected it was because she forgot which of the guys she had visiting were smokers, but I never spoiled the mood by pointing that out. I knew I wasn't the only guy she was sleeping with, but it wasn't like we had a future together. Tonight, she was with me. That was all either of us were asking from the situation.</p>
<p>"I'll think about it." I conceded. I knew she had a point about the exposure, but I didn't like being around large groups of people. Especially when those large groups of people would surely be pretentious douche bags. I traced my fingers along the long, swirling vine tattoo that climbed up her rib cage, making her wiggle away, giggling.</p>
<p>"Hey fucker!" she laughed "That tickles."</p>
<p>"You like it when I do that with my tongue." I grinned at her.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I do. So why are you doing it wrong?" She shot me a look of fake annoyance.</p>
<p>"I didn't know if you were interested in more than one round tonight."</p>
<p>"If you didn't know how to use that thing I might not be." She thumbed in the direction of my cock and licked her lips while lowering her eyelids at me. "But that's never been an issue for you."</p>
<p>"And here I thought you were just afraid to hang out at the apartment by yourself," I chuckled.</p>
<p>"When Laura told me she was going to see her family this weekend, your dick was the first thing I thought of." She rolled over and looked at my prick, letting her warm breath wash over it, breathing life back into it. "The rest of you was secondary."</p>
<p>I was taking a sip of my beer when she said that and nearly started choking with laughter.</p>
<p>A few nights later, I went to see a movie with some friends and we stopped at a bar on the way home. It was well past midnight when I finally got home. I let myself in the house and walked quietly to the kitchen and grabbed a bottled water from the fridge. On my way to the stairs, I noticed the TV on in the living room and went to see who was up.</p>
<p>Amy lay sleeping on the sofa in front of the TV. She was wearing boxer shorts and one of my Einsturzende Neubauten shirts. That little asshole, I thought, I'd been looking everywhere for that shirt. Her head lay in the crook of her arm, while her other hand lay on the sofa by her face, palm down. The shirt collar was stretched out and extended almost to her shoulder. Some of her long dark hair fell across her peaceful face. I couldn't explain why, but something about the way the light fell across her face and the way that she was laying really struck a chord with me. I felt an inspiration that very rarely ever struck me.</p>
<p>I quietly sat in a recliner across from her and slipped a sketchbook from my bag. I flipped it to a blank page as silently as I could and started sketching. The lines came easily to me, which was unusual. I always had a terrible time with drawing anything realistic. My obsession with drawing the little details had always worked against me and I wound up overworking the images until they were just a mess. I sketched the rough outline of her face as lightly as I could. Then I focused on her small hand, drawing out and shading her long, delicate fingers. There were so many inviting shadows to work on in the dimness of the room. I stared quietly at my sleeping sister across from me, taking in the shapes and angles of lines that made up her form. The curve of her shoulder as it turned into her neck, the dip of her neck just before it connected to her jaw. Her high cheekbones and her small ears with their delicate earlobes. The line of darkness where her soft, full lips met each other. Her eyes danced a little behind her closed eyelids, so I assumed she was dreaming. I worked on the drawing for several hours without even remembering I had the bottle of water next to me. Being thirsty was no longer even a factor in my mind.</p>
<p>When I was finally finished with it, I sat back in the chair staring at the drawing. Holy shit, I thought to myself. It was the best thing I had ever done. Without question. It looked so much like her that I felt like it had been drawn by someone else. I looked from the drawing to her and back at the drawing. Feeling absolutely elated with how well it had come out, I quietly closed the sketchbook, collected my bag and went to go upstairs. I paused next to her and very gently pulled the hair out of her face, tucking it behind her ear. She nuzzled her face into the crook of her arm again, never really waking up. I realized that night how truly beautiful she really was. I went upstairs wondering why I had never noticed that about her before, and wondering why I noticed now. As I fell face first on the bed in exhaustion, I realized that the sun was starting to peek in through the window.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I found myself thinking about Amy more and more often. I was pretty torn about it. I mean, we had always cared about each other, even though we didn't spend much time together anymore. But what I was feeling seemed like it was different. I noticed her shape a lot more, and the graceful way that she moved through the house, how her hips swayed when she walked. She was truly a stunning creature. Her long wavy black hair hung past her shoulders and when she had it down, it framed her face beautifully. She had piercing blue eyes, while mine were more of a light brown. She had a high cheekbones and full lips, as well as the most graceful neck I thought I may have ever seen. I found her neck incredibly sexy and couldn't quite explain why. Something about the curve of it. She had a slim, athletic build with average sized breasts that perfectly fit her frame and a beautiful, round ass. I admired her beauty from afar, as stealthily as I could.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>I continuously told myself that I was admiring her form from an artist perspective and that it was a natural, understandable attraction. She had, after all, been the muse for the greatest drawing I had ever put to paper. But I also kept thinking I was wrong for finding her sexy. Especially when I found myself contemplating her neck, breasts, thighs, hell... any part of her really. She had started creeping into my fantasies when I would masturbate, which disturbed me a good deal if I allowed myself to think about it. I felt like I should not be allowing myself to indulge these kinds of thoughts. She was my sister, for Christ's sake. But she would continue to sneak into them, regardless of our relation.</p>
<p>I once found myself in her bedroom, when no one was home. I stood in the doorway and smelled the air, which smelled faintly of her. I could catch hints of the perfume that she preferred, one of those pleasantly mild ones that claimed to smell like rain. I walked over to her bed and smelled her pillow, which gave me a stronger sense of the perfume as well as her natural smell. I felt a twitch in my cock as I took a second and third deep inhale of it. That snapped me back to reality enough to exit the room, pondering what the hell my problem was.</p>
<p>Late one Saturday night after work, I was upstairs in my room painting. Amy was out with some friends and our parents were off on some couples retreat. Taking advantage of having the house to myself, I had the stereo blasting an old Cure album loud enough to shake the room. This pleased me a good deal, and I would normally have been making serious progress with the canvas, but it just wasn't coming together tonight. I stared at the gray and blue images in annoyance for a few minutes, trying to figure out how to coax what I wanted from it. It just wasn't happening. I tossed my brush at the water glass in frustration and cursed to myself. Crouching to the ground, I snatched up a tube of black paint and rocked on my heels, glaring at the canvas. I had been wrestling with this same idea for a week now, and restarted multiple times. It was starting to outright piss me off.</p>
<p>"Fuck it." I muttered and squirted a big line of the black paint on the canvas. I grabbed a three inch brush and went to work blacking out the whole thing. I was still blacking out the canvas when the album finished playing and I kept painting in silence for a while when I heard a knock at my doorway.</p>
<p>Slightly startled, I glanced over my shoulder to see Amy in a green blouse and black skirt, leaning against the doorway, holding herself in tears. I dropped my brush on the drop cloth and scurried over to her.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Amanda?!" I hadn't called her by her proper name in years, and had no idea why I did now.</p>
<p>She hugged me tightly around the waist, and I hugged her back, forgetting I had paint all over my forearms. Jesus, she smelled good. What a time to have that thought. Flashing back briefly on my visit to her bedroom, I was mildly angry with myself.</p>
<p>"That fucking asshole! He slept with Katie!" she cried into my shoulder. "How could he do that?"</p>
<p>"Jeff?" I asked, knowing it was a stupid question as soon as it escaped my lips. She nodded as she continued bawling into my shirt. I felt the dampness of her tears on my chest and was filled with rage. It was crushing me to see her hurting. "Goddamn it, that asshole."</p>
<p>"I just can't believe he did that." she sobbed. "And that whore had pictures of it. She showed them to everyone."</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry, Amy." I kept holding her, wanting to make it better somehow. "It'll be okay."</p>
<p>"I don't see how," she sniffled. "I'm through with him."</p>
<p>"I should fucking hope so!"</p>
<p>I happened to glance down at her blouse and saw black paint smudges all over the back and sides of it, matching my hands.</p>
<p>"Oh shit, Amy! I fucked up your shirt, I'm sorry!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>She looked down at her shirt, turning it around on her small frame and started chuckling through her tears. "I don't care. It doesn't matter."</p>
<p>There was a pause before she sniffed and hugged me again. "I'm gonna go change. But can I.. would it be okay for me to come back after?"</p>
<p>"Sure, sis. That's fine." I thought a second, then added. "It's gonna smell bad in here for a bit, though. Just warning you. I'm about to use the paint thinner."</p>
<p>"I don't mind." she sadly smiled before she turned and walked out of the room.</p>
<p>I turned on the big fan I kept in the corner and opened the window before breaking out the paint thinner. Working as fast as I could, I cleaned up the brushes and cleaned my hands. I used as little paint thinner as I could and capped the bottle immediately, trying to keep the fumes to a minimum. I had finished cleaning and was coming back from scrubbing my hands with soap trying to kill the smell when she returned. She was clad in my Einsturzende Neubauten shirt and a pair of boxers. Her eyes were still rimmed with tears, but she'd cleaned up her mascara and looked less like an angry raccoon now. Seeing her in the shirt reminded me of the night I'd drawn her sleeping portrait. I felt a strange tightening in my chest at the memory, but shrugged it away.</p>
<p>She tossed the green blouse at me as she flopped on my bed. "You're right, that one's ruined. Use it for a paint rag or something."</p>
<p>"Sorry about that," I genuinely felt guilty.</p>
<p>"I don't care, really. It's not a big deal." She laid back on my bed and put her head on my pillow. The way my t-shirt lay against her, hugging her frame and the way her long, slender legs poked out from beneath it.. it was sexy. She was sexy. And seemed effortless about it. "What are you staring at?"</p>
<p>"What?" I asked, snapping back into focus.</p>
<p>"What are you staring at?" she repeated, glancing down at herself.</p>
<p>"That's my shirt, thief." I replied, feeling like an asshole for ogling her. Even more so for having been caught.</p>
<p>She laughed a little, and said "Oh yeah, it's comfy."</p>
<p>Amy kept staring down at the primitive figure on the front of the shirt for a few more moments, and suddenly trembled a bit. "Adam?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"If you've got that paint off.. I could really use another hug." Tears started up again.</p>
<p>I sat on the edge of the bed and gave her a big, long hug as she cried into my shoulder. I wasn't a violent guy by any stretch of the imagination, but I was really starting to think that a few minutes alone with Jeff and a brick would truly help me feel better about the world.</p>
<p>She clung to me for a few minutes, until she seemed to get it out of her system. She moved from sobbing to just sniffling. I kept quietly reassuring her, until I eventually just shut up and held her. After a while, she released her death grip on me. Her eyes fell on the canvas I had been working on.</p>
<p>"So.." she cleared her throat and wiped at her eyes with the back of a hand, "what's with the painting?"</p>
<p>"Huh? What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Why are you painting over it?" She motioned to the mostly blacked out rectangle.</p>
<p>"It wasn't working out like I hoped. I've been fighting with it for a while and finally decided to scrap it." I glanced back at the thing, remembering my irritation with it.</p>
<p>"That's a shame." she said, "it's kind of nice."</p>
<p>"Ah... the true measure of successful art. When your sister looks at your efforts and deems it 'kind of nice'" I laughed.</p>
<p>"Shut up, jackass." she joined me in laughing. "You know what I meant."</p>
<p>She stood and started flipping through a stack of canvasses I had leaning against a wall. As she went through them she started giving her opinions about different ones. I was kind of surprised, because she'd never shown much interest in my stuff, and she made some good observations. But I didn't say anything because I was glad to see her distracted from dickhead. We chatted for several hours about artwork, music, films, her upcoming trip to Rome, pretty much anything except what had her upset to begin with. Several times her voice would crack and her eyes would well up, but I would swiftly move to distract her with something else. It worked most of the time. I was surprised to discover she wasn't as vapid as I'd always assumed my little sister had become when we were in high school. While I'd gotten heavily into music and skateboarding, Amy had become a cheerleader and been involved in all sorts of student activities. We'd just grown apart and I came to perceive her as a stereotype. What an asshole I was, I thought with a small smile.</p>
<p>There eventually came a point where I was midway through a speech about my fondness for Ichikawa's Fires On The Plain when I realized she had fallen asleep. Which, admittedly, was pretty much what I expected to happen when I started rambling about black and white Japanese films to anyone. I was well aware that I was far too much of a film nerd for my own good sometimes. But she had fallen asleep in my bed, damn it. I sighed, turned off the bedroom light and slumped in my office chair, resigned to sleeping at my desk for the night. But I slumped perhaps a little louder than I planned.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" she groggily asked from the bed.</p>
<p>"Go back to sleep" I replied quietly, "it's fine."</p>
<p>"Bullshit." she mumbled nearly face down on the bed, "come to bed."</p>
<p>"I'm fine, don't sweat it." I put my head down in my folded arms on the desk.</p>
<p>"Don't be ridiculous." she patted the bed.</p>
<p>I didn't know how I felt about this, given my recent fixation on her. But I crawled into bed anyway, to avoid making an argument of it. She gave me a brief, lazy hug and I could feel her bra-less chest press against mine for only a moment. There was a twitch in my pants that I did my level best to ignore. "We used to share a bed all the time when we were little, remember?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I remember. But that's been like ten years." I replied as I yawned and folded my hands behind my head. She had been quite a bit less shapely in those days, and I had been a lot less aware of my own fondness for the opposite sex. Despite my wariness, we were both asleep within minutes.</p>
<p>In my dream, I was spooning Amy. Her perfect ass pushed up against my groin, my erection rubbing between the cheeks of her ass. I lazily ran my hand along her side and slid it across her ribs in a hug. She puts her hand over mine, holding it between her breasts as she grinds her butt back against me. I can feel her breasts on either side of my wrist, even through the shirt material they are warm and soft. My god, her hair smells amazing. She moans a little as my cock glides along her crack, and I feel like I may blow my load on the spot. I move to slide my hand down her body again, but she holds my hand in place. My fingers slip free and the motion causes me to snap my eyes open.</p>
<p>The fuck are you doing?! my brain screams as I wake up to realize I'm actually spooned up against her in the bed. I fought not to launch from the bed like a rocket, resulting in simply a startled jerk as I moved my pelvis away from hers as swiftly as I could.</p>
<p>"What was that about?" she asks, looking over her shoulder at me with one barely open eye.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I had a nightmare." I exclaimed, trying to restart my heart and praying she hadn't realized that her brother had just been pressing his dick on her ass, asleep or not. I suspected that I looked something like an animal trapped in a hunter's snare, terrified.</p>
<p>"Didn't feel like a nightmare to me." She said, as she gave a long cat like stretch and impishly grinned at me.</p>
<p>"God damn it," I exhaled, wanting to crawl into the crack between the wall and the bed and disappear.</p>
<p>"Oh relax, Adam" she continued, her eyes still laughing at my obvious panic. "It's just human nature. I know you didn't mean anything by it."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, that was really fucked up of me." I still hadn't fully convinced myself to breathe. "God damn it."</p>
<p>She laughed. And kept laughing.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she gasped "This is gonna be fun."</p>
<p>"What the hell do you me-" I stopped mid-question and was no longer mortified. Panic returned. All of the embarrassed crimson in my face drained to pale white. "Oh no... you wouldn't."</p>
<p>She grinned at me with her most evil grin and sighed, rolling on her back to look up at me playfully, upside down on the bed.</p>
<p>"Yep. Christmas dinner. Thanksgiving at Aunt Linda's. Family reunions. Birthday parties." She had a glint in her eye. "Any time you annoy me, I will just bring up the time we fell asleep in the same bed and you tried to have sex with me in your sleep."</p>
<p>"God damn it." I hung my head. "Move out of the way, I need the space to build up speed when I go out that window."</p>
<p>She laughed merrily. "You are so gonna be my bitch."</p>
<p>Amy let me stew in my personal hell a few moments longer, while she cackled gleefully. Then she put her hand on my arm. I looked up at her and marveled at how amazing she looked with her hair all jumbled and falling in her face from sleeping. "I'm kidding, Adam."</p>
<p>"What?" I looked at her, baffled.</p>
<p>"I'm kidding." she looked serious. "I wouldn't do that. What kind of terrible bitch do you think I am? It was an accident. I get it."</p>
<p>I exhaled a little, not sure I bought it, and still wanting to find that crack between the wall and the bed.</p>
<p>"But, damn, it's funny watching you panic." She beamed at me again. She crawled up to her knees and waddled across the bed to me. She gave me a hug, as I did all I could not to flinch away from her. "Thanks for last night. You really helped me deal."</p>
<p>She gave me a completely sister-like kiss on the cheek and walked out of the room.</p>
<p>"I want my shirt back, damn it!" I called after her. It was all I could come up with to say. How is it that she always gets the better of me? My cheek burned where her lips had touched it and I noticed I could still smell her scent in the room. It was heavenly.</p>
<p>That afternoon I met some friends for lunch at a food court near campus. I was grateful for anything to distract me from thinking about my morning. As I sat munching halfheartedly on something that was sold to me as bourbon chicken and struggled valiantly to taste mediocre, when I spotted Jeff sitting with a couple of friends at a table across the food court.</p>
<p>I should leave this alone, I thought. It's not my business. Amy can deal with her own shit. My mind flashed on her standing in my doorway in tears, looking so destroyed and heartbroken. How I felt so powerless to help her afterwards. That was all it took. That piece of shit needed to hear a speech and I was going to give him one. I was probably about to get my ass kicked, and I knew it. But sometimes, it's worth it, right? Hell if I know. I had never been in a fight in my life. I dropped my fork on the table and walked toward him, feeling the world get smaller with every step. I was just going to yell at him for a minute, tell him how badly he hurt her, but seeing him laughing with his friends just boiled my piss further. Their conversation dropped as I reached the table and Jeff glanced up at me.</p>
<p>"Hey Ad-" he started before I grabbed his head and shoved it into the table with all my might. His face bounced off the table as an asterisk of blood appeared on the table's surface. I barely registered that it had happened. My eyes were unfocused and I was just seeing a blur. I was overwhelmed with rage, not even thinking anymore.</p>
<p>His friends jumped back as I grabbed him by the hair on the back of his head and jerked him upright.</p>
<p>Blood was dripping on his shirt from his nose.</p>
<p>"A piece of advice, you rotted little cunt," I hissed in his ear, "the next time you decide to break a girl's heart by being the complete scumfuck that you are, make sure she's an only child."</p>
<p>He looked up at me with both hands clasped over his bleeding nose. "You broke my nose, you asshole!"</p>
<p>"Really?" I slammed his head into the table again, hearing a satisfying wet crunching sound, and glared at him "If I hear of you going anywhere near Amy again, or hear of you saying one hurtful thing about her, I'll come back and curb stomp your ass. You're lucky I don't rip your fucking dick off right now and feed it to you, shithead."</p>
<p>I jerked him straighter in the chair and stared dead in his eyes with pure rage. He was really pouring blood from his nose now. It came out between his fingers in little crimson streams. He eyes watered unchecked, and his expression, what I could see of it, was total shock and fear.</p>
<p>"Do you understand me? If she gets hurt again by anything even remotely involving you, I will make this look like nothing. I don't care about jail. I don't care about anything that happens after. You will not be around to see it. You got me, fucker?" I was snarling like a caged animal. My mouth was so dry from the adrenaline and anger that I could barely get the words out.</p>
<p>He nodded at me and I could see in his eyes that he believed me. I released him. He leaned forward on table, grabbing a bunch of napkins for the blood streaming down his face. I would have spit on him if I had been able to generate enough spit to do it.</p>
<p>I walked back, trembling, to my table across the now silent food court where my friends, and pretty much everyone else, stared at me in complete disbelief. Hell, I couldn't believe I had done it, either.</p>
<p>"Holy shit! Adam, what the fuck was that?" John asked me, when I got to the table.</p>
<p>"Dickhead cheated on my sister," I replied after taking a big swig of my bottled water, visibly shaken by what I'd just done. A wave of nausea hit me full force and I fought hard not to vomit.</p>
<p>"Damn, man. I've never seen you that mad." He looked at Jeff who was leaving with his friends. There was blood all over the front of Jeff's shirt. "That guy's bigger than you. How did you know you could take him?"</p>
<p>"I didn't know I was going to do that." I looked around a moment, wondering what the fuck had gotten into me, as people started talking again. I was getting plenty of looks, though. "I should get out of here before someone calls the cops."</p>
<p>"Yeah, let's go." John and the others grabbed their stuff. A couple of them gave me a playful shove as we walked back to our cars. I wasn't feeling jovial about it, though. I was already starting to think about how the hell I was going to explain myself when Amy got wind of this. Hopefully, she wouldn't find out.</p>
<p>Yeah... Right.</p>
<p>That night I had the house to myself again. I was kicked back on the bed, in the dark, listening to an old Portishead album and sipping a beer. It was well past midnight and I was starting to drift off when I felt a small hand on my chest.</p>
<p>Amy sat on the edge of the bed, looking down at me. I could only make out her silhouette in the shadows, but the smell of her perfume was unmistakable.</p>
<p>"Hey. When did you get home?" I asked, yawning.</p>
<p>"Just a few minutes ago." She replied as she grabbed my beer from the nightstand and took a sip.</p>
<p>"Thief." I mumbled as I reached over and hit the light switch on my desk lamp. I looked up at her and took in the way the soft light fell across her face. Her eyes were still rimmed in sadness. It would take a little while before she was over Jeff, I suspected. But, goddamn, she was beautiful. Suddenly self conscious about the way I found myself looking at her, I blinked away and reached for my beer.</p>
<p>She held up a finger at me and took a big swig from the bottle before passing it back. I polished it off and set the empty on the nightstand.</p>
<p>"So," she began, "my big brother is full of surprises lately."</p>
<p>"Oh?" I had a feeling where this was headed, but elected to play dumb and hope for the best. "Which one is that?"</p>
<p>"The only one I have." She responded quietly. "From what I hear, he beat the shit out of my ex-boyfriend at the Seventh Street food court today."</p>
<p>"Sounds like your big brother is an impulsive, immature jackass who should have stayed out of it to me." I sighed, resolutely looking away from her, pretending to be highly interested the goings on outside the bedroom window.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"Well, he can certainly be a jackass sometimes." She took my hand and squeezed it, "but I love that he cares and wants to protect me anyway."</p>
<p>"I wish I could say that's what it was," I replied. "But that wouldn't be entirely true."</p>
<p>Amy gave me a curious look.</p>
<p>"I didn't set out to kick his ass today. I was at the food court with some friends and happened to notice him there. He was laughing at cutting up with his little buddies. I just flashed back on how hurt and upset you were last night... and I just... I saw red." I sighed. "I just reacted with stupid macho bullshit. I'm kind of ashamed of it, to be honest."</p>
<p>"Well, don't be. He's an asshole." She smiled softly, "I have to admit, I was shocked when I heard what you did. But it also made me realize that we hadn't grown apart as much I thought we had. I like knowing that."</p>
<p>I looked over at her and she locked her beautiful blue eyes on mine. Neither of us said anything for a moment. I was unsure what to say, still genuinely embarrassed by my lack of self control, and who knows what she was thinking.</p>
<p>Finally, she spoke "Did you really call him a rotted cunt?" I had never heard her use that word, and was briefly taken aback.</p>
<p>"Um... Yeah. I think I did. I don't really remember." Did I call him that? Wow. I was pissed off.</p>
<p>"That's kinda gross, Adam." She made a face at me. "Even if it's true."</p>
<p>We both chuckled at that as she stood up to leave. "I'm glad you're okay. I don't mean to imply anything, but he's quite a bit bigger than you."</p>
<p>"People have been enjoying pointing that out to me today." I sighed.</p>
<p>When she got to the doorway, she looked back at me for a moment.</p>
<p>"I'm going to have to remember that line the next time some chick pisses me off. Rotted cunt has a nice ring to it." With that, she disappeared to her bedroom.</p>
<p>A few weeks passed, pretty much like normal until one morning as I sat at the bar in the kitchen sipping a cup of coffee when Amy came wandering into the kitchen wearing my This Mortal Coil shirt. She cut her half open eyes at me and mumbled something to the effect of "caffeine" but I wasn't entirely sure. Reaching for a coffee cup from the cabinet with her back to me, her (my) shirt pulled up, revealing her magnificent ass that was covered in only a pair of blue bikini cut panties. I had to discreetly adjust myself as my erection was instantaneous.</p>
<p>"Don't you have any clothes of your own?" I mumbled, motioning to my shirt.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but yours are more comfortable to sleep in." She grinned a little.</p>
<p>"Uh huh." I sipped my coffee and tried like hell to get the image of the perfect ass that I had just seen off of my mind. It felt like it was burned into my retinas as if I had stared at the sun.</p>
<p>"What are you doing today? Are you off?" She asked as she leaned against the bar over her coffee, thrusting her ass back from her body, which again called my attention to her lovely shape.</p>
<p>"I don't really have anything planned." I stretched "Maybe hit the bar tonight with the guys."</p>
<p>"But nothing today?"</p>
<p>"Not really."</p>
<p>"Would you like to hang out with me?" She asked, a little bashfully. "Maybe go walk the nature trails in the park or something? It's supposed to be a nice day out."</p>
<p>I thought about it a moment, then nodded. "Sure. Sounds like fun."</p>
<p>I could feel the smile emitting from her before I even glanced up to see it.</p>
<p>"Awesome! We're going to have so much fun!" She practically bounced out of the kitchen to go get ready. I have to admit, her excitement was a little infectious.</p>
<p>A short while later, I showered and dressed in tan cargo shorts and a blue Radiohead shirt. I packed the car with my backpack of art supplies (I always had a sketchbook or two with me), bottled water, soft drinks, a blanket, cookware, ice chest, and a few other bits. Amy came out to the car wearing a pair of cut offs and a loose fitting gray shirt. Her long black hair was pulled up in a ponytail, exposing her sensual neck. She was gorgeous.</p>
<p>"What's all this for?" She asked, motioning to the backseat.</p>
<p>"I thought we could use one of the grills at the park and cook some burgers later."</p>
<p>"Sounds perfect!" She exclaimed as she hopped in the car.</p>
<p>We arrived at the park by mid-morning and mercifully, it wasn't yet crowded. We spent the rest of the morning walking the nature trails, as we had loved to do when we were children. We talked a lot about different memories we had shared coming to this park all of our lives, and mostly just enjoyed the sun and each others' company. I couldn't help noticing how delicate her hands looked when she slapped at a bug, rubbing her neck where it had been climbing on her. She just seemed like such an exquisite and otherworldly creature to me, and I couldn't seem to shake the hold that she had on my mind.</p>
<p>When we got back to the picnic area, I got the coals started on the grill and began sketching piles of driftwood at the edge of the lake desperately trying not to stare at Amy stretched out on the blanket, taking in the sun. There were more people in the park now, and a couple of guys came by and started flirting with Amy. I felt pangs of jealousy that I did my best to stamp out by concentrating on the grill and resolutely ignoring them. I was beginning to think I was seriously fucked up in the head. She was my sister, for crying out loud. What the hell was I thinking? Amy was gracious with them, but finally sent them on their way, much to my relief.</p>
<p>After lunch, we packed everything back in the car, and I suggested we rent a canoe to paddle the lake. Amy thought it was a great idea, and we had a fun time paddling out along the waterline far from the camp site and all the people that were around there. I took advantage of being seated to the rear of the canoe for paddling reasons and allowed myself to gaze longingly at her many times because her back was to me. I loved watching the way the sun worshiped her skin, perspiration lightly glistening on her neck and upper back like a glaze. Thankfully, it was a beautiful day out, and Amy enjoyed looking at the birds and other wildlife that congregated around the lake. I caught a small turtle that she thought was adorable and let it wander around in the bottom of the canoe for a few minutes before she begrudgingly released it back into the water. The delighted expression she kept on her face as she played with the turtle was far more adorable than the admittedly cute little turtle could ever be. After several hours that passed faster than I would have liked, we headed home. It was the best time I had spent with anyone in quite a long time.</p>
<p>Over the next several weeks, Amy started hanging out at home more frequently. She would often come up to my room after dinner and do homework while I painted. Sometimes she'd talk endlessly about different topics as I prepped canvasses and mixed paints, but she seemed to understand that I needed quiet when I was actually working on a design. When I was painting, she would keep quiet and focus on her studies, read, and once in a while, take a nap.</p>
<p>She took a liking to some of the music I played while I worked, and would occasionally request that I make her a copy of some of it. I was amused when she told me that she finally got around to looking up some Einsturzende Neubauten songs and, while she liked the shirt that she had stolen from me, she couldn't understand what I found appealing about the band. I laughed and told her it was an acquired taste.</p>
<p>I found that I genuinely enjoyed her company a great deal, and would sometimes wind up in a debate of some kind or another and get nowhere on the painting I was working on. She was smart, very likely smarter than me, funny, easy to talk to, and had some idea of what she wanted to do with her life, which was more than I could claim.</p>
<p>She liked to travel, and was leaving for Rome soon, a two week trip she had been planning with a couple of friends for several years. They'd saved up for it from their part time jobs and finally had set a date between semesters. I would have loved to see Rome and other parts of Europe myself one day, and we spoke of different places we'd like to visit. I found it hard to keep my eyes off of her, as she would often turn up in her pajamas, which usually consisted of boxer shorts and a t-shirt. She made my life even more complicated when she would turn up after the gym, in tights or running shorts and a sleeveless t-shirt over a sports bra, which accentuated the curves of her breasts. On those occasions, I would try to keep my back to her and keep myself busy, stealing glances at her incredible ass or the swell of her breasts when I felt it was safe to risk doing so.</p>
<p>Somewhat to my dismay, however, I found my attraction to her was not purely physical. She invaded my thoughts at all times of the day and night. For her part, she seemed to enjoy being around me as well. She started texting me while she was in class or while I was at work, telling me about the goings on in her day, or asking me the name of some song or another that I'd had playing when she was around that she wanted to listen to. Her optimism, kind heart, and enthusiasm for life was unbelievably refreshing for me, as I spent much of my time being an introverted hermit, painting away in my room. My friends were all wise asses and bitter artist types. More than once, I found myself wondering why she would want to hang out with me.</p>
<p>The rekindling of our childhood closeness, while not intentional, seemed to please our mother a lot, too. I sometimes spotted mom smiling at us from the corner of my eye when we would hang out together watching TV in the living room or the like. It was all a lot to take in. Guilt gnawed at me for feeling the way that I did about her, but I felt powerless to change it. It was a dead end, and I knew it. There was nothing to hope for here. No future. Just pining away stupidly over something I could never have. I needed to distract myself.</p>
<p>Megan stared at my painting while she chewed her thumbnail, seemingly deep in thought. A little more than a month had passed since the incident in the food court, and she had come by my place to see some of my latest paintings at her own insistence. She slowly moved back and forth down the row of paintings I had leaning against the wall, but kept coming back to the same one.</p>
<p>It was light colored painting, unusual for me, measuring 36 x 48 inches, with light hues of blue, green and yellow throughout. Although it was done in acrylic, it gave off a look similar to a watercolor. The abstract images seemed to form loosely into figures interweaving, sometimes meeting to embrace and sometimes not. The figures were only hinted at, and never fully formed so that the viewer's mind would have to fill in the gaps to realize what they were seeing. From a distance, if one did not focus their eyes on the image and looked at it from the side, there was a very faint depiction of a female face holding an expression of ecstasy into the image that took up the entire canvas. The face was buried under layers and layers of texture, more hinted at than fleshed out. I was quite pleased with the end result. On the surface, it didn't look much different from a lot of my art, color scheme aside, but I had worked very hard to blend in elements of the things I was trying to convey with this one, and I felt like it worked.</p>
<p>"This one," Megan said, speaking around her thumbnail, "there is something about this one. It's really erotic somehow."</p>
<p>"Is that a good thing or a bad thing?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oh it's good, it's very good." She looked up at me. "I've never seen you do anything I thought was erotic before."</p>
<p>"Really? Damn. I thought I had moves." I smirked. "Guess I need to try harder in the sack."</p>
<p>She started chuckling, "Oh you've got moves alright, smart ass."</p>
<p>Megan backed herself up to me and pulled one of my arms over her shoulder, resting my right hand on her left breast. I instinctively started feeling for her nipple ring as I hugged her. Luckily, she'd opted to forego a bra that day. She kept staring the painting for a while, until her eyes closed softly and her breath started to quicken.</p>
<p>"You need to do the show next month. I'm telling you, you have to do it." She whispered, letting her head fall back on my shoulder as she reached behind her and started rubbing my cock through my pants.</p>
<p>"Jesus, Meg, again with this?" I sighed in annoyance, despite the attention she was paying to my prick.</p>
<p>"You need to do it, Adam. Dr. Miller would shit if one of his students turned in something like this as an assignment." She gasped as I twisted the nipple ring slightly between my fingers. "Especially after you dropped his class last semester."</p>
<p>"I don't know. I really hate those things, Meg." Although, I had to admit, the idea of annoying Dr. Miller's pompous self-aggrandizing ass did appeal to me. "Oh what the hell..."</p>
<p>"Really?!" She spun to look at me, my boner suddenly forgotten. "You'll do it? I have the submission forms in my bag!"</p>
<p>"Uhm..." I looked down at the bulge in my pants as she darted to where she had dropped her shoulder bag.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know." She giggled, without even looking back at me. "But I'm grabbing these forms before you change your mind. Then, we can get back to that bit of business."</p>
<p>One Friday afternoon, our parents took off on another of their weekend trips that had become quite common since Amy and I were both adults now. Amy was looking through a women's magazine on my bed while I was working on a new canvas, painting in a second coat of the background color. She held up the magazine to a photo she wanted me to see.</p>
<p>"I'm thinking of adding a blue streak to my hair like this. What do you think?"</p>
<p>I glanced at her for a moment, and then pensively looked away. I dropped my hand to my crotch and grabbed my package.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I was right." I nodded, feigning relief. "Just checking."</p>
<p>She looked at me, baffled. "Checking what?"</p>
<p>"Making sure I was still a guy." I smirked. "Why the hell would you think I know anything about women's hair?"</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes at me. "I just wanted your opinion, ass."</p>
<p>Then she started pointing at me and cackling. Not at the wisecrack, but at me. I looked down to discover that I now had part of a yellow hand print on my cargo shorts, right over my balls. I hadn't thought of the wet paint on my hands when I decided to make the gesture.</p>
<p>"Damn it!" I sighed, and then started snickering as well.</p>
<p>"That's what you get for being a jackass." She snorted. I couldn't argue with that.</p>
<p>Later that evening, after dinner, she was back in my room again, having changed into boxers and one of my Cure shirts. She was making fun of me as I was adding more partial hand prints to my shorts to hopefully help mask the fact that a paint covered hand had clearly grabbed my nuts.</p>
<p>"You know... You could probably do anything you wanted to your hair and still look beautiful." I offered, feeling a little tense as I said it. She had asked for my opinion, and I guessed I would give it to her.</p>
<p>She looked up at me, smiling bashfully. "Thank you, Adam. That's sweet."</p>
<p>"You really think I look... beautiful?" She asked after a moment. I could see her eyes locked on me out of the corner of my eye, but I didn't look up, for fear she would see the answer in my eyes. The answer and more. More than should ever be present in her brother's eyes.</p>
<p>"Definitely," I replied, feeling my chest tighten up as I said it. It was a heartfelt compliment, and one I wasn't entirely comfortable admitting. My eyes continued to avoid hers.</p>
<p>There was an awkward silence in the room, as the computer had finished the playlist I'd had going. Feeling weird about what I'd just said, I went to the laptop and fired up another album. A more upbeat, album that didn't add to the emotional tension I was fighting in myself. She just watched me as I moved about the room, not saying anything.</p>
<p>"Jeff never said I was beautiful." She finally spoke, softly.</p>
<p>"Jeff is an asshole." I replied. "Who gives a shit what he thinks?"</p>
<p>"I know." She smiled. "It's just nice to hear it."</p>
<p>"I call him an asshole all the time." I joked, cutting my eyes at her just in time to duck the pillow flying at my head. I grabbed the pillow and threw it back at her, laughing, grateful for the shift of the mood in the room.</p>
<p>I joined her on the bed and started tickling her, like I had done when we were younger. She thrashed around, squealing, and trying to get away from me while laughing her ass off the whole time. The world felt like it just consisted of that room for a few minutes. I don't know how else to describe how I was feeling at that moment. It wasn't erotic or sexy. I wasn't trying to sneak a feel of her. This was just dumb childish fun, something we hadn't done in a long time. We collapsed on the bed, both sweating a little and gasping for breath. I rolled on my back and stared at the ceiling, having worn myself out for a moment and trying not to stare at her heaving chest.</p>
<p>Amy scooted over near me and laid her head on my chest with one arm draped across me, in a slight cuddle. Only her head, arm, and shoulder touched me. She smelled so good. I looked down and impulsively kissed the top of her head lightly. She tilted her head to look up at me and our eyes locked for a long moment. I desperately wanted to kiss my kid sister's soft, full lips. Kiss her and a whole lot more. Finally, her face broke out in a soft smile. Her eyes seemed to smile as well. Her smile could light up a room, I decided.</p>
<p>"I'm really glad we've become close again."</p>
<p>"Me too." I replied, and meant it.</p>
<p>I broke her gaze and stared out the bedroom window at the sky, feeling an ache in my chest and trying not to let it show.</p>
<p>"Adam?" she asked tentatively.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" I glanced back down, to see she was no longer looking up at me, but instead had her eyes on one of the stacks of canvases against the wall.</p>
<p>"Would it be okay for me to come to your show? I'd really like to go and see my brother's paintings hanging in a gallery, all properly lit. I should get back the day before."</p>
<p>"Of course." I replied, feeling strangely emotional that she would want to come. "It would mean a lot for you to be there."</p>
<p>She hugged me with the arm she'd had on my chest. "Good."</p>
<p>"Hey Amy?"</p>
<p>"Hmm?"</p>
<p>"I want my shirt back."</p>
<p>"Oh, shut up."</p>
<p>The afternoon before Amy was to leave for Rome, the house was a flurry of activity. Mom was going overboard, making lists and nagging Amy she needed was packed for the trip. Our father would periodically pass through the living room and demand to see her passport, boarding pass, and so on in order to make sure she had them all and could grab them on a moment's notice. Amy seemed frazzled by the whole thing, but was still elated. For my part, I tried to stay the hell out of the way. I loaded her phone up with some music she liked to try to help her pass the long flight time with and left it at that. Well, I mostly left it at that. Ever the music nerd that I was, I slipped in a few songs along the way that I felt she needed to hear. After that task was finished, I kept to my room, listening to music, and avoiding the whole scene downstairs. Our mother could get pretty intense about these kinds of things. If I were being honest, I would also have to admit that I really wasn't looking forward to not seeing her for two weeks, even if part of me kind of thought it might be a good opportunity for me to try to shake my ever growing feelings for her.</p>
<p>Later that evening, after the dust had settled and all parties seemed to be content that she was as ready for the trip as she would ever be, I risked a trip into the kitchen to forage for dinner. Amy was eating an apple at the bar in the kitchen when I walked in. I cocked an eyebrow in her direction as I grabbed a beer from the fridge and fished around on my key ring for my bottle opener.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"I need one of those after all that," she smiled at me.</p>
<p>"I'd imagine so. Better you than me. I've already decided that when I go on a trip by myself, I'm going to tell them about ten minutes before I leave when I've already got the car packed." That got a laugh out of her.</p>
<p>She watched me as I made a sandwich, leaning over to snatch a piece of turkey I had just slapped into place and eating it with a little grin.</p>
<p>"Goddamned thief." I muttered giving her a fake evil stare as I dug more turkey out to replace it.</p>
<p>"You gonna miss me?" She asked as she chewed on her stolen turkey with no remorse in her thieving heart.</p>
<p>"I thought maybe a little, but then someone jacked my turkey and I'm thinking of driving them to the airport now to let them hang out in the lounge all night." More than you know, was the answer ringing in my head.</p>
<p>"Mom was saying you have to work in the morning and aren't gonna be at the airport to see me off." There was a hint of disappointment in her voice and I definitely picked up on it.</p>
<p>"I would if I could, sis, but I gotta open the shop tomorrow." I did feel bad about that, but the owner at work was out of town and I was the only one they trusted with the business while they were away.</p>
<p>"I know. I just wanna see you before I go." She was pouting a little. I had to admit to myself that it was rather adorable, if a bit juvenile. I finished my sandwich preparation and looked up to unintentionally lock eyes with her. There was a hesitant look in her eye, like she wanted to say more but chose not to. I hoped she wasn't pissed at me for not being able to take her to the airport.</p>
<p>"We'll hang out tonight, then." I replied, "Hang out and watch a movie or something."</p>
<p>"That sounds like fun." Amy brightened, and gave me a quick hug as she stole a bite of my sandwich. "I'll see you in a bit."</p>
<p>"Damn it, brat!" I looked at the hole in my sandwich in mild irritation, more from habit than actual irritation. If she had stolen a bite of my sandwich when I was fifteen or so, there would have been hell to pay. I've mellowed with age, I guess.</p>
<p>Laughing like the little brat she was being, she disappeared into the living room. I wrapped my sandwich in a couple of paper towels, grabbed my beer, along with a spare from the fridge and scooted upstairs to my room before my mom caught a second wind and started barking orders again.</p>
<p>Amy showed up a little while later, wearing my This Mortal Coil shirt again, and we settled on something to watch. One thing that needed to happen while she was away, I thought, was that I needed to go through her closet and reclaim my damned clothes. I laid back on the bed, and she laid a pillow on my stomach and laid across me to prop herself up so we could both see the TV.</p>
<p>"I'm sure dad's repeatedly given you the speech about being careful while you're over there, yeah?"</p>
<p>"Definitely." She laughed.</p>
<p>"Do I need to give one as well?" I asked, cocking an eyebrow again.</p>
<p>"What's that? My big brother is worried about me?" Amy smiled at me, even her eyes seemed to smile. Her smile could kill someone with a heart condition, I was sure of it.</p>
<p>I shrugged. "Well, yeah. I suppose he is. And unlike dad, he's reasonably sure that you'll spend a good deal of time getting drunk off your ass in night clubs and be vulnerable to all manner of Italian lowlifes."</p>
<p>She reached up and grabbed one of my hands, pulling it to her mouth and kissing the back of it. "I promise to be careful, Adam. I hope to have a lot of fun, but I'll be careful about it." There was a pause. "Thank you for caring though."</p>
<p>I left it at that, I'd said my piece. I really wanted her to have fun and enjoy her trip. Part of me didn't want her to go, but I would never tell her that. I sort of disappeared in my thoughts for the majority of the movie, enjoying that my sister was here with me, spending time with me, and feeling that dull ache in my chest that reminded me that I wanted more from her than that and could never act on that emotion. The movie came to an end, and the credits rolled. Amy didn't move.</p>
<p>A few minutes passed in silence, and I heard her snoring softly. Pinned under her, I didn't see where there was much I could do about the situation without waking her up. Unwilling to do that, I lay there for a while just taking in her smell and reflecting on how great she felt laying against me. Before long, I fell asleep myself.</p>
<p>When I woke up, the room was dark. Amy must have gotten up at some point and turned the light off. She hadn't gone to bed, though. At least not to hers. She was still here, asleep, cuddled up against me. Her left leg draped over mine, along with her left arm and shoulder across my chest. Her head was laying on my shoulder, with the top of her head just below my chin. It felt very... intimate, and my heart hammered thunderously in my chest at the realization.</p>
<p>I reached up with my free hand and rubbed my eyes, grabbing the bridge of my nose and yawned. The movement caused Amy to stir. She tilted her head, and I felt her lips brush lightly against my neck, her warm breath blowing across my throat. I became aware that her heart was beating fast against the side of my chest.</p>
<p>"Please," she whispered against my throat so softly that I could barely hear her at all, "tell me it isn't just me."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Holy. Shit. My stomach knotted up so hard that I wanted to double over. Did she love me back? Was I misinterpreting her meaning? Fuck. I tried to swallow but got nowhere. My mouth was completely dry.</p>
<p>"I mean... I feel like there is more going on with you and me than... brother and sister." She struggled with the words, clearly afraid of my reaction. "It's isn't just me, right?"</p>
<p>Fucking hell. I wasn't the only one feeling this way. It wasn't me dealing with this shit. It was both of us. My mind was racing so fast, trying to untangle my thoughts that I didn't reply. I felt like my body temperature just skyrocketed and I struggled to breathe. I wanted her so badly, I was so in love with her, but to admit it and acknowledge all that it meant was just... overwhelming.</p>
<p>"Please.. Adam," she whispered, her voice was shaking. "Please answer."</p>
<p>The fear in her voice snapped me out of the tangled snarl in my head. I took a deep breath, feeling like someone on a tightrope, and forced out the words. "It's not just you."</p>
<p>"Oh, thank god!" she sighed and squeezed me so hard that I thought she was going to snap one or two of my ribs. I felt dampness hit my neck and realized she was weeping. "I couldn't leave without knowing. I was going crazy."</p>
<p>I was both elated and terrified. I brought my hand up and cupped her cheek. She bent her face to the curve of my palm and placed her hand over mine. I brushed one of her tears away with my thumb.</p>
<p>I slid my hand from her cheek down under her chin and gently guided her head up to meet mine. I couldn't see more than the outline of her face in the complete darkness, but it didn't matter. I leaned in and felt our lips touch. Amy's arm shot up like a mouse trap and wrapped around my head, holding me in place so tightly it almost hurt.</p>
<p>Our lips parted and my tongue started hungrily exploring her mouth, just as hers did mine. We were kissing in earnest, in a way that brother and sister were never meant to kiss. Her lips felt even more amazing than I had imagined. Her tongue seemed kind of small, a bit pointed, and quite muscular. She darted it into my mouth and scouted around with it with much more finesse than my own possessed. She was intoxicating, and I found myself feeling giddy. The kiss was incredible, charged with the anticipation and need that had built in both of us for over the past few months. It felt like seconds, it felt like hours. The immense relief that she shared my feelings was indescribable. I sucked her lower lip into my mouth, gently holding it in place a moment before releasing it as we broke contact to gasp for air. She let out a small whimper that made my heart jump. Within the space of a breath, I dove on her planting a series of kisses along her jawline, down her exquisite neck that had so captivated me these past months and along her clavicle until I was stopped by her shirt collar. Well, my shirt collar, actually. The damned thief. She moved her head to the side to allow me access to her neck and released a combination of moans and whimpers as I worked my way along her neck that threatened my self control with every breath.</p>
<p>"Jesus, Adam" she whispered, her breath heavy and fast, as I kissed my way back up her neck. "You're an amazing kiss. I can't believe this."</p>
<p>"Neither can I." I paused kissing her as my mind snapped back into reality. I wasn't so much of a hedonist that I could lose my grasp on the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>"I didn't mean for you to stop," Amy pouted into my ear, punctuated by her nibbling my earlobe.</p>
<p>"I don't want to stop, either" I began, "but you're my sister. This is wrong."</p>
<p>"I know," she replied with a heavy sigh, "but it doesn't feel wrong to me. I know it's supposed to, but it doesn't."</p>
<p>She licked my neck and planted a kiss on the wet mark her tongue left. Damn it. My head and my cock both thought that was a hot as hell move she'd pulled. I fought to remain focused on talking this out.</p>
<p>"You have no idea how badly I want you. But this is some heavy shit we're getting into." I took a deep breath, "This could ruin our lives, you know? It's really fucked up."</p>
<p>"You want me?" Amy asked, even in the darkness, I could feel her eyes on me.</p>
<p>"You sorta picked up on the wrong half of that statement, but yes, I want you. More than you know. Maybe more than you will ever know."</p>
<p>"Is this just about sex for you?" She asked timidly. There was a note of worry in her voice, but she was trying to hide it.</p>
<p>"Not at all." I replied as I sat up and scooted back to prop my back against the wall. "I mean, if that's all it was and you felt the same, we might could just sleep together and get on with our lives. It's kind of fucked up, but it's not insurmountable. At least I don't think it is, you know? It's a lot more than sex for me. That's what scares me."</p>
<p>I couldn't decide if it was good or bad that we were in darkness. I felt really exposed talking about my feelings like this. Not only because I was in love with someone I shouldn't be, but because I wasn't one to express my feelings in general. I couldn't see her beautiful face, or the effect my words had on her. In some ways, that was a relief.</p>
<p>I felt Amy shifting on the bed as she sat up and scooted over to me. She felt for my knees, then turned to face away from me, pushing herself back to lay against me. Leaning back to rest her head on my shoulder, she pulled my arms around her. "I want you to hold me." It wasn't a request.</p>
<p>"I can do that." I hugged her to me, taking in the smell of her hair again. She relaxed against me.</p>
<p>"It's more than that for me, too." She sighed, "I've been so confused. And scared to say anything."</p>
<p>"I'm glad you did." I allowed myself a small smile, "But there's still a big problem."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know." She hugged on my arms.</p>
<p>"You're my little sister, and I love you. You are a huge part of my life. I can't allow myself to cross a line that we can't get back from. If it went bad for us. Everything would change. I have a responsibility to watch out for you. If I were to hurt you, I couldn't do that. I couldn't be there anymore. I don't want you, don't want us, to ever be something I regret. You mean too much to me for that." I said, feeling more exposed than I ever had in my life. I could have walked into the University library ass naked and not felt as vulnerable as I did at that moment.</p>
<p>"Wow..." Amy said very softly. "I mean, holy... shit."</p>
<p>"What?" I was puzzled.</p>
<p>"I think that is the most incredible thing anyone has ever said to me." She sat up to stare at me in the darkness.</p>
<p>"Really? I stole that off of a Hallmark card. They have a whole selection of cards in their web store devoted to incest." I was immediately rewarded with an elbow to the ribs.</p>
<p>"You can be such a jackass." She laughed and let herself fall back into my arms. "You drop a line like that on me and then follow it up with wisecracks."</p>
<p>"Sorry, I guess." I replied, without much conviction. I'm a born wise ass, I can't help it.</p>
<p>"Actually, it's one of the things I love about you." She sighed. "As far back as I can remember."</p>
<p>After another few minutes passed in silence, then another elbow suddenly shot into my ribs.</p>
<p>"Oof!"</p>
<p>"Wait a damned minute!" She exclaimed, suddenly sounding indignant, "just sleep together and get on with our lives?! You think I'd be that forgettable in bed?"</p>
<p>"That's not what I meant and you kno-" I was cut off by her mouth covering mine again. She was kissing me again, and chuckling when she stopped for air. I decided that if I died that night, having tasted no more than her lips and tongue, I felt I could die happy. A fucking degenerate who got off on kissing his little sister, but at least a happy one.</p>
<p>"I'm just screwing with you." I could feel Amy's smile against my throat as she was kissing it repeatedly, before whispering seductively in my ear. "But just so you know, I'd do everything I could to blow your mind. And I'm pretty sure I could do it, too."</p>
<p>My heart nearly seized up for the third or fourth time that night, not quite believing the words that I heard coming from my baby sister, but my cock certainly got the memo, as I was certain there was no way she didn't feel it pressing against her back by now. Mercifully, she didn't mention it.</p>
<p>"I'd love to see you try. But we can't..."</p>
<p>"I know." She held me close to her, and I hugged back. We lay there in silence for a while before she spoke again. "Fucking Rome. I'm going to miss you so much. I almost don't want to go anymore."</p>
<p>"Don't be silly, Amy." I stroked her hair. "This trip is huge for you. You guys saved for it for years. I'll still be here when you get back. It's only two weeks."</p>
<p>"It's the longest we've ever been apart in our entire lives, you know that? Two weeks."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know. I'm really looking forward to the peace and quiet."</p>
<p>"Asshole." But there was no malice in her voice, only mild humor and affection.</p>
<p>"I'm going to miss you, too." I kissed the top of her head, "But you are going to have a wonderful time."</p>
<p>After a while, she seemed to fall asleep laying back against me as I remained propped up against the wall. I didn't sleep. I just listened to her breathing and took in her smell, marveling that I was holding my baby sister in my arms in a way that I had so desperately wanted to and would never dare to imagine I would. Despite being taught from a young age that how I felt about her was seriously fucked up and even illegal to act on, she felt right in my arms. I wasn't sure how to reconcile that in my head.</p>
<p>Just when I was about to fall asleep, I felt her small hand slide up to my throat, the ball of her thumb resting just below my Adam's apple and her long, delicate fingers wrapping up around the side of my neck and base of my shoulder. It occurred to me that she could crush my esophagus from this position. Or try to, anyway. I glanced down at her as her head tilted to look up at me. I could see the curve of her smile in the darkness.</p>
<p>"I think.. as long as we are always honest with each other and take things as they come we will be fine." She said softly.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean that as long as we are always honest with each other, always, there won't be room for us to hurt one another and come to regret each other. That way my big brother can always be there for me, as he should and more, and we can worry about whatever lines there are when we get to them instead of having them haunt us with words like 'never' and 'can't'..."</p>
<p>I thought about it for a few minutes, "Maybe..."</p>
<p>"I can live with 'maybe'. 'Never' and 'can't' would be much harder to deal with." She leaned up and kissed my throat above her hand.</p>
<p>"Amy?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Were you gonna choke me out if I still said 'never'?" She could hear the note of humor in my voice. She knew then that I wouldn't turn my back on our feelings for each other. I don't think I could have made any other decision if I were honest with myself. Wrong or not, I was in love with her.</p>
<p>Her hand slowly slid down from my throat to my chest and she patted it once, lightly. "...such a jackass."</p>
<p>I heard her breathing slow as she drifted off to sleep again. I looked at the clock a short while later, and saw that I had only an hour before I had to leave for work. Time flies. I gently woke her up. We said our goodbyes and she quietly padded to her bedroom. I showered and got dressed. Just before I left the house for the morning, I slipped into her bedroom for one last goodbye kiss, lingering long enough to risk making myself late. Then I headed to get the store open for the day, feeling like a total asshole for not taking her to the airport. I got through the work day on caffeine and the strange sense of elation that accompanies the discovery someone wants you as much as you do them. Even if you aren't supposed to want them. When the shift mercifully ended, my eyes burning from lack of sleep, I went home and collapsed face first on the bed and slept until nearly midnight. The last thing I noticed as sleep overtook me was that the sheets smelled like Amy.</p>

<p>Part Two.</p>
<p>Other than hearing from my mother that Amy had arrived safely in Rome, I heard nothing from or about her for the next several days. I hoped she was enjoying herself. As a slap in the face to my joke the night before she left, the house seemed empty and quiet without her. I missed her already. The first couple of days I suspected that she was having the time of her life and was too busy being enthralled with Rome to contact me. Her facebook page seemed to be updating constantly with photos of her and her friends at museums and restaurants. The only hint of anything at about us was that she posted a link to a song I had included on her phone that she proclaimed a new favorite that her friends should hear. That got a half smile out of me.</p>
<p>The morning of the third day, I started to worry that she was being quiet because she regretted what had happened with us. By mid-afternoon, I felt like I was becoming a nervous wreck. I couldn't bring myself to send her a message. I didn't want to interrupt her trip. That evening, resolved to clear my head, I went to the bar with John.</p>
<p>Several beers and shots later, I was in better spirits, talking with John about the rapidly approaching show.</p>
<p>"You never have liked being around people that much, dude. But it's gonna be great. You've got talent. It'll be cool for some of the right people to see that."</p>
<p>"Meg talked me into it, really. Mostly to piss off that prick that teaches Art 202. She seems to think I've got something to prove, but I really don't." I took a sip of my beer. "Not that I would mind peeing in his cheerios a bit."</p>
<p>"See? This is why I prefer my chemistry classes. I just gotta memorize the stuff and puke it out on a test. None of this ego driven shit you gripe about." John chuckled.</p>
<p>My phone vibrated in my pocket and I slipped off the bar stool to get it from my pocket.</p>
<p>"Getting texts at one in the morning? You got some chick begging for it?" John raised his eyebrows at me. "Can't be Meg, she's over there."</p>
<p>He motioned to where I hadn't noticed Megan was sitting with some other art majors at a corner booth. Her hair was now a violet color. She looked up just as I glanced her direction and smiled at me. I gave her a small smile back, trying to be polite. We hadn't seen each other in a few weeks, as I'd made up excuses to not go to her apartment the last couple of times I'd been invited.</p>
<p>I looked down at my phone and saw the message was from Amy. "It's unbelievably beautiful here."</p>
<p>I exhaled heavily, feeling a giant knot in my stomach begin to unravel. I quickly replied. "You must fit right in."</p>
<p>Another text arrived. "I was already spending all my time thinking about the night before I left. You aren't helping. :)" That made me smile.</p>
<p>John looked at me expectantly. "Are you going to tell me who's texting you or what? They sure cheered you the fuck up in a hurry."</p>
<p>"It's my sister. She's vacationing in Rome and just checking in. Believe me, my life isn't that interesting, dude." At least, I sure as hell didn't want him to know how interesting of a turn it had been taking lately.</p>
<p>"Ah. Damn. I'm disappointed. I thought you were holding out on me." He laughed and took another hit off of his beer before signaling to the bartender for another. If he only knew, I thought.</p>
<p>I dropped my phone back in my pocket and finished off my beer before heading for the bathroom. My bladder had been sending up warning flairs for a few minutes now.</p>
<p>"Back in a minute." I commented offhandedly.</p>
<p>The bar was busy that night, and there was a line for the bathrooms. Cursing my luck as I waited in line, my phone vibrated again. I started retrieving it from my pocket, but saw Megan walking toward me. I let the phone slide back down in my pocket. Amy would have to wait a minute. Megan glanced at the pocket my phone was in, but caught herself and tried to hide it.</p>
<p>"Hey stranger," Megan said, clearly buzzed, as she gave me a quick hug. "Are you ready for the show?"</p>
<p>"Just about ready. At least in terms of having stuff ready to hang. I'll need about six more beers before I'm ready to deal with the people there." I chuckled at her.</p>
<p>"Well, you've got about a week and half. I'm pretty sure you can drink a six pack in that time." She leaned a bit closer. "Or, you could come by my place later and I could help you relax."</p>
<p>"I'd better not tonight, I have to open the store tomorrow." I replied. It wasn't entirely true, but I didn't want to get into that kind of conversation with her tonight.</p>
<p>"That's too bad. It's been a while. I'm starting to think you're avoiding me." Megan gave me a wink and leaned up on her toes to give me a quick peck on the cheek before heading back to her friends. "Give me a call soon."</p>
<p>I turned back toward the bathroom and exhaled. I checked my phone again. "I had a lot of time to think on the flight. And I have some regrets."</p>
<p>I had been thinking I was too drunk for this conversation when I started reading it, but the last sentence sobered me up. A lot. The dark knot threatened to return, but she did seem happy about us just a moment ago. This had to be something different from the capital "R" version of regret, right? I simply replied with "...regrets?"</p>
<p>"Not that kind, sweetheart. I mean the kind that have me over here in my lonely hotel bed this morning, wondering what it would feel like to have your hands on me." I read the message and tried to restart my heart, pondering where one might buy one of those defibrillation machines. Despite the feelings we clearly shared, it was a mentally jarring experience to consolidate the life long version of my sister with the newly discovered version of my sister who was now flirting with me. Successfully, I should add, considering the twitch I felt in my pants when I read her words.</p>
<p>"Give me a few minutes, I'm checking flight plans." I responded, wishing it were an actual possibility.</p>
<p>"Don't tease me like that, dear brother. I'll get even."</p>
<p>"Oh? Do tell." I smirked to myself. A challenge for her. A little of the old sibling rivalry kicked in, I guess. I finished up in the bathroom, which took longer than it should have due to the effect her words had had on my prick, and headed back to the bar, feeling much better about things, and really wishing she were back already so I could show her exactly what she was wondering about.</p>
<p>I noticed Megan doing her flirting routine on a tall guy with glasses and a bun in his hair at the far end of the bar. I caught her clearly watching me out of the corner of her eye. I'd seen this before. She didn't know who I was texting, but it bothered her and she was trying to get me jealous by hitting on someone else. Like I said before, she could be emotionally draining. Possessive, but unwilling to commit to anything herself. I'd worked this out long ago and was not going to wander along with her, bathing in the wake of destruction she would unleash on my emotions if I gave her half a chance. But, power plays aside, she was a nice person. Just a bit damaged. One of those people whose company you enjoyed, as long as you kept a certain amount of distance between you. If you let yourself get sucked in, you'd wind up with an ulcer and most likely an alcohol problem. I headed back to my bar stool and ordered another beer.</p>
<p>"Jesus, dude." John nodded toward Megan, "a man bun? Really?"</p>
<p>I started chuckling, finding it more amusing than I probably should have.</p>
<p>"You didn't tell her that was your sister messaging you, did you?" He smirked.</p>
<p>"Nope. More fun to watch her squirm." I laughed. "Does her good to get a taste of her own shit once in a while."</p>
<p>"You are a mischievous little cunt, you know that, sir?" Then he added. "I knew we got along for a reason."</p>
<p>That got a good laugh out of me. Damn, I was drunk. I glanced out of the corner of my eye and saw Megan nibbling on man-bun's neck. She was my friend, and I cared about her in as far as that went, but her attempts to make me jealous were in vain. She wasn't who I wanted anymore. If I ever had wanted her to begin with, that is. There had long been a time, early in our friendship, when I thought I did. I was going to have to have a talk with her eventually that I wasn't looking forward to.</p>
<p>I took another swig of my beer when my phone vibrated again. I glanced down at it and raised an eyebrow. It was an image file. I opened the message and the photo was of a hand, a small, pale hand with long delicate fingers extended toward the ceiling in a beautiful hotel room. I noticed the fingertips were wet and a line of clear fluid dripped down from a couple of them. The photo was captioned "thinking of you."</p>
<p>I nearly shot beer out of my nose as I choked. I grabbed a napkin off of the counter to wipe my face, coughing the whole time. John gave me a befuddled look and I made a weak excuse of having swallowed my beer wrong. After a few more minutes and several attempts to come up with a witty reply that I decided to delete instead, I texted back "Jesus, you play dirty."</p>
<p>"Oh, you have no idea... ;)"</p>
<p>I woke up the next day on the sofa in John's apartment with the worst hangover I'd had in a long time. I thanked him for giving me a place to crash and caught a ride back to the bar for my car before work.</p>
<p>Work was an entertaining affair. Nothing beats working in a music store when you are hungover. The loud music was not my friend that day. I cursed that I'd never learned Spanish as I attempted to alphabetize the selection of Latin CDs, when my phone vibrated.</p>
<p>Another image. I'd forgotten all about the previous one all morning because I had felt like death was using a jackhammer on my brain. I may never drink again, I lied to myself, as I opened the image. The side of a thigh was visible in the image, lying in a bed with a sheet covering part of it, exposing the long, smooth leg from just above the knee all the way up to the stomach. The owner of the leg was clearly nude, despite there being no nudity in the photo. That didn't mean it wasn't sexy as hell, it's sole purpose being to show me that she was naked in bed. My little sister was being a tease! I was immediately turned on and ducked into the back room to adjust myself before I encountered a customer.</p>
<p>"You are killing me, you know." I sent.</p>
<p>"Good." I had to smile at her answer. This was a different side of my sister than I had ever seen. I had thought about her plenty, in a sexual sense. But learning this side of her personality was new and intriguing in a way that I hadn't really stopped to consider previously. All that aside, I was dying for her to come home. This only made it worse.</p>
<p>I leaned against the darkroom wall and watched as Megan lifted the photo from the water bath with her tongs. She clipped the photo up next some others to dry on the line of wire that stretched across that part of the room. She grabbed the next photo from the bath and repeated the process a few more times before she noticed I was there.</p>
<p>"Oh, hey you." She smiled, and came over to give me a quick hug.</p>
<p>"Hey" I replied, "how it coming along?"</p>
<p>"Pretty good. Come check em out." I followed her over the the line and looked at the drying photographs.</p>
<p>"These are nice, Meg. Very cool." I pointed at one in particular that I thought was a great one. "Especially this one."</p>
<p>"Thanks." She replied.</p>
<p>"So what's up? Your text was pretty vague." She asked.</p>
<p>I had been dreading this part. We weren't really dating, but I didn't feel like I should just break off the sexual aspect of our friendship with no explanation.</p>
<p>"I just wanted to apologize. I haven't been around much lately and I hadn't really given you an explanation either. I met someone, and it feels kind of serious."</p>
<p>"I get it. It's cool." She replied. It wasn't exactly a cold reply, but she didn't sound too happy about it either.</p>
<p>"I felt like I should tell you. I mean, I know we weren't exclusive or anything, but I didn't want to just not come over anymore and leave you wondering."</p>
<p>"You're right. We weren't dating. It's fine. We're friends that used to fuck sometimes. Don't make it bigger than it is." She said dismissively.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright. So we're good?" I surrendered.</p>
<p>"Yes, we're fine." Megan rolled her eyes at me, then smiled a little. "Now, if you're done trying to be all noble with my feelings and shit, will you come over here and help me decide which one of these prints you think I should use?"</p>
<p>Clearly, she didn't have much of an emotional investment in me as I had worried she did. Or if she did, she was certainly not willing to admit it. Either way, I had tried to be honest and not hurt her feelings. I walked over to look over the stack of prints she had motioned toward.</p>
<p>"Sure, let's see what you got."</p>
<p>About an hour later, it felt like most of the awkwardness of our conversation had passed and I felt like we might be okay. Maybe even capable of settling into a friendship without benefits. I honestly did like Megan as a person, and didn't want to lose her as a friend if it could be helped. But I also knew that things tended to be more complicated than people liked to admit once someone whipped out their dick. And Megan was one of the least complicated things involving my dick these days.</p>
<p>In the end, she had settled on the prints she wanted to use for the show, including many of my choices. She signed a couple of prints that I'd really liked and handed them to me for my personal collection. I thanked her and slipped them in one of my sketchbooks so that they wouldn't get torn up until I could get them home to store properly.</p>
<p>As I went to leave the darkroom to head back to the house, she called after me.</p>
<p>"Hey?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?" I turned back toward her. She had slung her bag over her shoulder and was pulling her silly ass beret back on. I'd mocked her for that beret more than once, much to her annoyance. Such a clich.</p>
<p>"Don't be a stranger. I mean it. We're seriously okay. It's not like I don't care about you. It's just not that... "together" kind of thing, you know? So don't avoid me, alright?" She sounded genuinely concerned as she reached for her camera bag.</p>
<p>"I'll be around. No worries. I wouldn't have come talk to you about this if I didn't give a shit about you either, you know." I smiled.</p>
<p>"I know. Thanks for the help with the prints. I'll see you at the show Friday." She grinned.</p>
<p>"Yep. I would say that I'd be the suicidal looking guy in the corner, but it's an art show. There's bound to be a dozen of them."</p>
<p>"Whatever, smart ass. It's gonna be a blast. You just don't want to admit it."</p>
<p>Every couple of days Amy sent another photo. Never anything actually nude. But all sexy, suggestive, and inviting. Never showing her face, or anything that would give a clue as to who took the photos. She was cautious, I had to give her credit for that. The last photo, sent two days before she was to come home, was of her hips, wearing a tiny pair of black panties. A piece of hotel stationary lay on her stomach with the words "Wish You Were Here" written on it, along with an arrow pointing down at her crotch. That one made my cock stand up and pay attention for damned sure. She pretty much had me around her finger by now, but I wasn't going to tell her as much. The photos she sent were having exactly the effect that I suspected she was going for. I was missing her tremendously already, and now I was feeling like I was losing my mind with desire on top of that. Not that I minded.</p>
<p>But the airlines and the weather could not have cared less about my desires. The day Amy was supposed to come back, a bad storm caused severe flight delays at one of her connections and she messaged me that she would be stuck at a layover and not be back in time for my show. I acted like I was not as bothered by it as I was for her sake, but I was really looking forward to her being there with me. I kept myself busy as hell building frames for the paintings I'd be showing to keep my mind off of the fact that she wouldn't be there. Truthfully, I was more disappointed that I wouldn't get to see her for another day, but it wasn't like I could change that.</p>
<p>The night of the show, I was a jittery bundle of nerves. I had no use for these things, but it was good exposure. I walked through the exhibit, checking out everyone's work. Megan had some great photographs and mixed media on display. We shared a brief hug, and she told me how excited she was that I was in the show with her. I told her she looked great in her vintage red dress, which earned me a smile. All in all, it was less awkward talking to her than I thought it would be. There was some decent work on display. A few of the local artists were really good. Many of them were better than I was, in my opinion. I hung out by my section for the most part, feeling totally out of place. I was dressed in nice slacks and a gray tailored shirt with a black tie. I was not one for dressing up. Left to my own devices, I would have turned up in a shirt for some band and pair of khakis. I looked at my paintings, framed and properly lit on the wall. It was the first time in a long while that I actually felt like an artist. I was proud of the pieces I had on display.</p>
<p>My friend, John, walked up and handed me a beer. "At least they have hooch."</p>
<p>"Well, there is that." I laughed.</p>
<p>"Dude, you think highly of your stuff, eh?" He motioned to the price tags on the paintings. I'd picked prices almost arbitrarily, and purposely priced them higher than I felt that they were worth. Mostly as a joke on some of the other artists. Most of the artists priced their stuff to sell, as they didn't have another source of income, believing that they could make a living once they had their degree. There was a world full of people out there with degrees in art that couldn't find a job. I really didn't care much if any of mine sold or not.</p>
<p>"What? You mean to tell me you think this isn't worth $1500?" I pointed at the painting Megan had thought was erotic. "The artist needs the money for his drug habit. Heroin ain't cheap, bitch."</p>
<p>"I thought that was why he gave blow jobs in the alley."</p>
<p>"That's just for the gas money."</p>
<p>"Ah. I wondered how you were getting home tonight." We both chuckled.</p>
<p>John turned toward the front of the gallery and suddenly mumbled "Holy crap."</p>
<p>"Hmm?" I asked, turning toward him.</p>
<p>"Your sister is looking hot, dude," He said motioning toward the entrance. "No offense."</p>
<p>I looked toward the front of the gallery and saw my parents walking in, followed by Amy. She was wearing an elegant, tight black dress with matching heels, small pearl earrings and a string of pearls around her slender, gorgeous neck. Her long, dark hair pulled up in a ponytail that cascaded down one shoulder. An electric blue stripe of hair cut through the dark ponytail. Her make up was flawless and accentuated her features beautifully. With the dress and the pearls, she reminded me a little of Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Not that I'd ever seen the movie, but I'd seen images of Hepburn from that film a thousand times. I didn't recall Hepburn's dress looking like it was painted on, either. Amy was absolutely stunning. My heart knotted at the sight of her and I completely forgot to breathe. I hadn't seen her since the night before she left for Rome and it was all I could do to keep myself from running to greet her.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>She scanned the crowd a moment and her eyes locked on mine. Her face lit up in a beautiful smile and she marched straight to me, gliding through the crowd like they weren't even there. As soon as she reached me, she gave me a hug that lingered a half second longer than would probably be considered normal, but not long enough to draw attention. She pulled away and gave me a swift look. Her eyes saying so much more than we were able to say aloud in this setting.</p>
<p>"Wow, Adam, this is awesome! Your work looks so great hanging up like this." she exclaimed motioning to the paintings behind me. She sounded genuinely excited about them. Probably even more than I was.</p>
<p>"They really do," my mother said, as she and my father caught up with her by my side. My dad shook my hand, and mom gave me a quick hug. They all greeted John, and looked around at my paintings.</p>
<p>"Thanks for coming, guys." I managed to say, fighting hard to keep my eyes off of the beautiful girl currently holding my arm at the elbow in a fierce death grip. I couldn't help noticing that several other people in the room were having trouble keeping their eyes off of her, either. For some reason, this amused me a little. Probably because I knew she was there only for me.</p>
<p>"I thought you weren't going to be here?" I asked, glancing at her.</p>
<p>"No way in hell was I gonna miss my big brother's first gallery show," she said, squeezing my arm in reply. "I had to switch a few flights around, found an alternate route home. I wasn't sure I was gonna pull it off and when I realized I was, I decided to surprise you."</p>
<p>"Wow, that was really cool of you. I'm glad you made it." I was impressed.</p>
<p>After about a half hour of small talk, while my dad concentrated on his drink and continuously checked his watch, my mom asked Amy if she was ready to go home. Amy gave me a questioning glance and said that she would rather hang out here and ride home with me if that was okay. I told them that was fine and my mom hugged us and left. My father, as usual, barely acknowledged me. I was reasonably sure that my mom or Amy had nagged him into showing up. My money was on Amy if I'd had to place a bet.</p>
<p>"Finally." Amy exhaled as she smiled at me. "I kept thinking mom would get a read on me."</p>
<p>It occurred to me that it was the first time our parents had seen us together since the night before she'd left for Rome as well. I'd been so distracted by everything else that I hadn't even thought of it. That was probably for the best.</p>
<p>"You look absolutely incredible." I spoke quietly.</p>
<p>She blushed visibly, and cut her eyes bashfully at the painting next to us. "Thank you, Adam. I wanted to look nice for you tonight."</p>
<p>"You could have come in a trash bag and still been the most beautiful thing in the room. But I am completely blown away."</p>
<p>Amy turned even more red, but she was beaming at me. I grumbled as more people walked up and looked at my work with various degrees of interest. I was soon having to engage in forced conversations about my work with strangers who I suspected were probably just feigning interest in my paintings so they could get close to the incredible looking girl in the black dress nearby.</p>
<p>"I'm going to take a look at the other art in here for just a minute and grab a drink. I'll be right back, okay?" She asked me, squeezing my arm again.</p>
<p>I nodded and watched her walk away from me, admiringly.</p>
<p>John appeared at my side within moments. "You gotta let me ask her out, man."</p>
<p>"You go near her and I'll rip your nuts off. So ask yourself, is it worth it?" I jokingly snarled. I knew him well enough to know he was just screwing with me.</p>
<p>"That depends," He took another swig of his beer, "are you going to rip them off before or after the date?"</p>
<p>We both started snickering at that line.</p>
<p>"This is interesting work you have done here, Adam."</p>
<p>I turned to face Dr. Miller who was looking at the so-called erotic painting.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Dr. Miller." I replied, waiting for him to rip into the painting. Instead, he moved to the next one, a crimson and yellow one that I'd arbitrarily named after a song I'd been listening to at the time I painted it.</p>
<p>"I know you dropped my class last semester, but I'd like to see you come back," Dr. Miller said as he looked the painting over again. "Not to inflate your ego, but you've grown a bit since I saw your last assignments."</p>
<p>"This is more in my element than painting flowers in vases is all."</p>
<p>"You got to learn to crawl before you can walk, Adam. You have the skills to do what you are wanting to do right now. But if you work on the basic foundations, you can do so much more and tap into your potential."</p>
<p>I was genuinely surprised to see him express any interest in my work. "I'll give it some thought, Dr. Miller."</p>
<p>"I urge you to do that." He said, clearly looking down his nose at me as he said it. Then he turned and moved further into the gallery.</p>
<p>John had wandered away when Dr. Miller arrived and was now off talking to Megan and Man-bun, who had apparently accompanied her to the show. I chuckled to myself and looked for Amy, who now had a glass of wine and was looking at some watercolor paintings a guy had hanging a few yards away. I walked up to her as she was staring intently at a watercolor of koi fish in a pond.</p>
<p>I walked with her through the rest of the gallery, as she pointed out which works she liked and didn't. She caught me up on her trip to Rome, and the chaotic trip home. Whenever art snobs would descend on my little section of wall, she did an amazing job of running interference, distracting them from trying to engage me in pretentious explanations for my work. She worked the crowd like a champ and seemed to enjoy doing it. I was impressed. Finally, the opening night for the gallery wrapped up and we were able to leave.</p>
<p>As we were leaving the building, I seized an opportunity to pull Amy after me into an empty side room and kissed her hungrily. Her lips immediately parted, allowing my tongue access as she wrapped her arms around my neck. My hands, taking on a mind of their own, slid down her sides, feeling the contours of her body. A tiny whimper escaped her lips, as she broke her mouth free of mine. "I missed you so much, baby." She cooed. "Take me home."</p>
<p>Back at the house, my parents were clearly interested in hearing all about Amy's trip, and she was swiftly trapped in the living room chatting with them. After a few minutes, I excused myself to go upstairs and change. I caught a quick glance of dismay from her as I headed up the stairs, and I smirked at her. She'd be stuck answering every question they had for the next twenty minutes at a minimum. I chuckled at her predicament, in that way that siblings always enjoy watching each other squirm in front of their parents. In the meantime, I could change out of these clothes and hang out in peace.</p>
<p>I swapped the shirt and tie for an old Tear Garden shirt and a pair of shorts, dug around on my computer for a few minutes until I found the album I was looking for, hit play and flopped on the bed. Without meaning to, I was asleep in minutes.</p>
<p>"You abandoned me" I heard a soft, pouting voice. I cracked open one eye to discover the room was mostly dark, just a soft light from the computer screen across the room. She was sitting on the edge of the bed, wearing one of my shirts, her hair now loose and framing her face as she looked down at me. I glanced past her and saw the bedroom door was closed.</p>
<p>"Because I knew I couldn't keep my hands off of you if I stayed out there and would have gotten us in trouble." I replied, snatching her up in my arms and pulling her down on to the bed. She started giggling, knowing I was full of shit and not caring. But her giggling stopped almost immediately and was replaced with soft gasps as I ran my tongue along the side of her gorgeous, sensual neck and began planting a series of kisses along the damp stripe I'd left behind. She took my head in her hands and pulled my gaze to hers as our lips met. Her tongue shot into my open mouth and started to explore as my hands slid down her sides, wrapping her in a tight embrace. She sighed and relaxed into me.</p>
<p>I let my hands drop to her thighs, feeling her smooth, bare skin. My hands slid slowly up her thighs, bypassing her panties, moving under her shirt causing her to moan into my mouth. I pulled my palms away from her skin, and allowed only my fingertips to lightly glide over her as I moved my hands up her back, she shivered at the feel of my fingers. I realized, suddenly, that she wasn't wearing a bra. My dick twitched a little at the realization, making me feel like I was in high school again, about to see my first set of real, live tits. When my hands were up to her shoulder blades, I allowed my hands to lay flat on her back and slide down her sides along her rib cage. I couldn't believe how soft and warm her skin felt as I allowed my hands to pull her tighter to me. She exhaled a pleasurable groan in my ear. Her breasts were smashed up against me and, even through our shirts, I could feel her hard nipples on my chest. She shivered again against me.</p>
<p>"How..." she gasped softly, "how do you.-" the rest of her thought was lost as she smothered her mouth on my neck when my thumb brushed along the side of her breast as I was running my hands on her sides. I was gliding the hand back down toward her hip when she suddenly seized it and moved back up toward her breast. I had been planning to take my time and build up her anticipation by teasing her further, but I could take a hint. My hand cupped her soft, full breast, her hard nipple pressing into my palm. More like burning into my palm. My heart skipped a beat the moment my hand touched her, and she gasped loudly in my ear, shuddering and shoving her chest into my palm as hard as she could. Her hands held my shoulders in a death grip and I realized that her thighs were sandwiched together like a vice. She released a couple of whimpers between her gasps, and suddenly bit into my shoulder muffling a loud moan.</p>
<p>Realizing what was happening, I caressed her soft flesh until her nipple fell into the gap between my thumb and forefinger. I gripped it lightly, pulled it toward me and that was all that it took. Amy's eyes were squeezed shut, her mouth on my shoulder to silence her cries, gasping for air in sharp quick breaths as she climaxed at my touch. I continued to pull her nipple gently a few moments longer, rolling it between my fingertips while using the rest of my hand to caress her breast and then slid my arms around her in a tight hug.</p>
<p>When her breathing calmed down and she released my now quite sore shoulder, I whispered in her ear "Jesus, baby, you have no idea how sexy it was to hear you come for me."</p>
<p>"Really?" she asked into my throat.</p>
<p>"Hell, yes." I was still holding her tight against me and kissed her forehead.</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to do that. Not yet, I mean." She let her voice trail off as if debating what she was going to say, then continued. "A few nights ago, I was laying in a room at the Palazzo in Rome getting myself off to a fantasy of the first time you touched me like that. I think I kinda set myself up for it."</p>
<p>"Well," I chuckled, "it makes me feel better about nearly doing the same."</p>
<p>Looking up at the ceiling for a moment, I slowly mumbled "holy shit."</p>
<p>"What?" Amy looked up at me quizzically.</p>
<p>"I just felt my little sister's tit and told her how sexy it was to listen to her have an orgasm."</p>
<p>"...and it freaked you out?" Her worry was palpable.</p>
<p>"It should, shouldn't it? But it doesn't. I think it's pretty bad ass that I can make you come just by touching you like that." I made a big show of buffing my nails on my shirt and smugly examining them.</p>
<p>The worry fell from her face and she tried hard to suppress a smile. "I'll let you have that one. But you're going to have to put in some work before I decide whether or not you get to keep that ego of yours going."</p>
<p>"You are a dirty tease."</p>
<p>Amy rolled onto her side, away from me, then scooted back against me so that we were spooning. I felt her arm reaching back and feeling around on my abdomen for something and not finding it. Finally, she patted my side in annoyance. "Gimme."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Gimme your arm, jackass."</p>
<p>I reached over and let her take my hand, which she curled up over her and held to her chest, my forearm resting between her breasts. She sighed contentedly. Her hair smelled amazing. I nuzzled her neck and kissed it. "I could kiss this neck forever. I fucking love your neck."</p>
<p>The corner of her mouth twitched upward a little and she pulled her hair away from her neck to provide me more access. "I'm a dirty tease, huh?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, you are." I replied between kisses on her neck. She ground her perfect ass lightly against my erection, and I flashed back on the morning I'd woken up against her in a very similar position. "Have I mentioned how incredibly beautiful you are?"</p>
<p>"You have, dear brother." Amy wriggled her butt until my cock was nestled between her ass cheeks and pushed back against me harder, causing my cock to slide along her crack. Her arm snaked up above her, behind my neck, cradling my head to her. "Ooohh..." escaped her lips as the rhythm of my cock sliding against her ass was having an effect on her.</p>
<p>"You..." she groaned "made quite an impression on me at... uhnn... the show tonight when you told me that."</p>
<p>"You made quite an impression as well," I gasped, not quite believing that the most perfect ass I had ever seen was grinding against me right now.</p>
<p>"I'm really proud of that," She breathed, groaning again as my cock made another pass. "But it kind of backfired. I wanted to be pretty for you, to make you want me. But when you looked at me like you did, and told me that... I was afraid it would become obvious how wet I was."</p>
<p>My hand traveled from between her breasts to sliding back under her shirt to cup one of her breasts. She gasped, pushing her hips back against me harder. "You feel so good against me." I breathed.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?" She leaned forward and pulled her shirt off completely, dropping it to the floor. Even in just the soft light of the computer screen across the dark room, I could make out every curve and contour of her upper body, especially her breasts which were swollen in her excited state. They were full, warm and inviting. Their areola were slightly upturned and only a few shades darker than the creamy softness that they capped, with hardened, pinkish nipples the size of small marsh mellows that I found I was dying to put my lips on. Although, to be fair, I wanted to put my lips and tongue on every square inch of her body. I pulled my own shirt off and dropped it behind me. She laid back down, facing away from me and put her ass back against my crotch.</p>
<p>As soon as her bare back was against my chest, my cock twitched, and she pushed her ass back against me with a pleasurable groan. I felt my balls start to tighten and swiftly backed my crotch away from her. I didn't want to come yet. She gave me a puzzled look.</p>
<p>"I'm getting a little overexcited, sorry."</p>
<p>Instead of replying, she rolled over to face me and slid her hand down over my crotch. She reached her hand into my shorts and grabbed my bare cock in her hand. I let out an involuntary gasp. She let out a long ragged breath as she stroked my shaft. I moved my hands under hers and unbuttoned my shorts so that I could slide them off. She leaned up to my ear and whispered seductively, "I've been dying to know how you taste."</p>
<p>She rolled with me until I was on my back and she was on top of me, her thighs straddling my stomach. I watched, completely enthralled, as she sat up, arching her back up away from me to pull her hair back behind her. It had an amazing effect of making her breasts thrust out at me. Seeing her back arched away from me in such a seductive manner just took my breath away.</p>
<p>Unable to resist, my hands shot up her sides and cupped both breasts, pulled toward her nipples like a magnetic force. She jerked her arm across her face, eyes closed tight, burying her mouth in the crook of her elbow, silencing a loud moan as best she could. The heat coming from her radiated across my stomach, making me even harder. I raised up, moving one hand behind her back, and took her nipple in my mouth, giving it a hard lick with my tongue. I sucked on it like a man possessed, keeping it trapped between my lips and running my tongue all over it. First keeping my lips rolled over my teeth as I pulled it toward me, then occasionally allowing my teeth to lightly graze over it without ever biting down. The gasps above me bordered on hyper ventilation as her chest heaved. I felt her warm dampness slowly spreading over my stomach. Combined with the smell of her arousal, it made me so erect that it bordered on being painful.</p>
<p>I laid back down, guiding Amy back down, still on top of me, with my mouth unwilling to let go of her glorious nipple. Both of us made a startled gasp as the movement caused her hips to slide downward and my cock slide between her legs making contact with her pussy over the fabric of her boxers. She ground down on it, her pussy sliding down the length of it eliciting a shuddering gasp from both of us and I became aware that it wouldn't take much more of that before I would be done for.</p>
<p>I moved my mouth to her other breast and gave it the same treatment as the first, just as her thighs clamped down on my hips in earnest. I could feel them starting to quiver against me.</p>
<p>"Ooohhh, fuuuucckk" she gasped harshly in my ear and shoved her face in my pillow as her hips ground against me. My dick felt like it was trying to saw through the fabric of her boxers as it memorized and worshiped every contour of her sex. With each thrust, she would shudder harder and I knew I was in my final moments as well. I slid the hand that was on her back down and into her boxers, cupping one of those amazing ass cheeks and pulling her pelvis against me as tightly as I could.</p>
<p>"Baby, you are so amazing" I managed to gasp out as I released her nipple and thrust one final time against her. I groaned into her shoulder as my cock twitched violently against her panties, launching streams of semen against both of our stomachs. Her legs were clamped around me like a vise and I could feel the spasms in her pussy and legs as she released nearly muted cries and moans into the pillow. She collapsed into me, her whole body vibrating with the aftershock of her orgasm. We both lay there, covered in a light sheen of sweat, catching our breaths. My throat felt bone dry from all of the heavy breathing I'd been doing.</p>
<p>"My god," she exhaled and swallowed "If I known it was going to be like this, I'd have thrown out my dildo in high school and just snuck in here every night."</p>
<p>My head whipped to look at her hard enough that I thought I may have pulled something.</p>
<p>"What? You thought your little sister wasn't playing with herself in the next room all these years?" she smirked at me. She felt the slight twitch in my groin, and whispered "Oh, I did. Sometimes more than once a night, even. I'd lay in bed and feel myself up..." she began kissing my chest, moving down toward my stomach.</p>
<p>"...to whatever fantasies were playing in my head that night." Her tongue made a trail down my stomach to the first bit of fresh come and began to swirl her tongue in it, forgetting her thought as she suddenly seemed very distracted by the mess I'd made. She made a show of licking all of the semen off of my stomach before raising her head back up look at me, smiling. "And, yes, dear brother. Some of those fantasies were about you."</p>
<p>She got an evil grin on her face when she saw how I cocked an eyebrow at her in surprise at her last statement. "I'll be right back, okay?"</p>
<p>I nodded, as she scooted off of the bed, grabbing her shirt and slipped out of the room. I lay there a few minutes in the dark, mentally digesting the idea that my sister had been getting herself off to fantasies about me since long before all of what had taken place between us. I pondered how that may have played a role in how we got to the place we were with each other emotionally and physically. And what the hell were those fantasies about? Eventually, when I had almost drifted off to sleep, she quietly returned to the room.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>She had changed clothes and had brought a warm damp cloth with her. She insisted on cleaning up the remainder of the mess I'd made from my stomach and prick, giving me a few gentle strokes when she was satisfied that it was all cleaned up. She dropped the cloth on the floor and laid back down next to me.</p>
<p>"So... about those fantasies about me?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Got you curious, did I?" She was clearly amused.</p>
<p>"Definitely. What were they about?" I was intrigued and let it show. That was probably where I went wrong because now she knew she could use my interest to torment me.</p>
<p>"I dunno. You did stuff to me. I did stuff to you. You know... fantasies." She gave me a purposely vague smile. I lifted a hand to brush some loose hair from her face and tucked it behind her ear. She softly closed her eyes in appreciation for a moment when I did. I loved doing that for some reason.</p>
<p>"But what kind of stuff?" I asked, suspecting I was about to get nowhere with this line of inquiry.</p>
<p>"Nope. I'm not telling you that. A girl's got to have her secrets."</p>
<p>"Ugh... Fine. Be that way..." I sighed in mock annoyance.</p>
<p>"Mom and dad need to go out of town again," she sighed, sort of wistfully. "It sucks I can't sleep here tonight."</p>
<p>"I wish you could sleep here, too. But at least we can see each other in the morning for breakfast."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but... I don't know. It's not like I just can't sleep next to my new boyfriend." She put her arm around me, snuggling up against me with a pouting expression. "You're more than that. It's just frustrating."</p>
<p>I knew she was right, but since I didn't have any grand solution come to mind, I simply hugged her and held her until she finally, begrudgingly, gave me a long kiss goodnight and returned to her room. I fell asleep almost immediately.</p>
<p>The next morning, I woke up to the sound of mom yelling for me to come to breakfast. The house smelled of bacon and pancakes. I crawled out of the bed, changed clothes, and wandered downstairs in search of bacon.</p>
<p>Mom handed me a plate and I sat at the dining table to eat, mumbling a greeting to my dad, who was reading the morning paper. A couple of minutes later, Amy sat across from me with a plate of her own and slipped me a quick smile before she began attacking her plate in earnest. Mom joined us and we all ate with the kind of small talk that accompanies families who are not very awake yet in the mornings at breakfast.</p>
<p>When I absently reached up to scratch a spot on my shoulder that itched, Amy suddenly coughed and began doing her best to suppress a giggle. I looked up at her and saw both her and my mother looking at me. Amy's eyes were lit up in amusement, but my mother's was slightly more troubled.</p>
<p>"Um, Adam? You may want to tell your little photographer friend to calm down a little in the future." My mother said with a slight look of disapproval. "I certainly hope you are using protection."</p>
<p>At the words "little photographer friend", my sister suddenly shot me a look. Thanks for that, mom.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" I asked, puzzled, as I dropped my hand from my shoulder to pick up my glass of orange juice.</p>
<p>"Have you seen your neck? I think she got a little out of hand."</p>
<p>I felt the rush of blood to my face and scurried to the downstairs bathroom to see what our mother was on about. Sure enough, sticking out of my shirt collar, right where my shoulder and neck connected, was a nice set of red bite marks. Just about the spot that Amy had latched her teeth on my shoulder as she had her first orgasm with me the previous night. Thankfully, mom seemed to think it had been put there by Megan. She'd unwittingly given me my cover story.</p>
<p>I returned to the breakfast table, and sat down sheepishly. "I didn't realize she'd done that. Sorry, mom."</p>
<p>I stole a glance at Amy who did her best to look like the picture of innocence as she ate, even if slightly pleased with herself. I felt her food slide along my shin under the table as she slipped me a sly wink. I proceeded to spend the rest of the meal feeling self conscious about the teeth marks on my neck and couldn't resist reaching up to scratch them occasionally, much to Amy's amusement.</p>
<p>After breakfast, I showered and returned to my room, already dressed and drying my hair with a towel.</p>
<p>"Damn. That photographer chick really did a number on you." Amy smirked where she sat with her legs crossed in my office chair with her phone in her lap. "Maybe I should go have a talk with her. Tell her it isn't right to go tagging my big brother like he's an animal in a wildlife refuge."</p>
<p>"I certainly should." I replied. "She damned near gave me a heart attack at breakfast."</p>
<p>"Still, you must have done something right to set her off that wildly."</p>
<p>"It's a possibility." I chuckled, remembering the events of the previous evening.</p>
<p>"So who is she, anyway?" Her smirking had stopped, but she didn't seem upset.</p>
<p>"An artist friend of mine that I used to mess around with occasionally. That's over with." I went straight for honesty, having nothing to hide and knowing it.</p>
<p>"Ah... The little redhead with the red dress and the nose ring from the gallery?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's her." I was genuinely impressed. "How did you guess that?"</p>
<p>"I saw her checking you out last night. A few times, actually. I wasn't the only one who thought you looked pretty hot in a dress shirt and tie, I guess." She gave me a lustful glance and I felt a twitch in my shorts.</p>
<p>"Huh. I hadn't noticed." I'd had a life long blind spot for these things.</p>
<p>"So it's over with?"</p>
<p>"It's been over for a while, now." I responded. "Not that our mother got that memo, apparently. But that worked in our favor a short while ago, I'd say."</p>
<p>"I believe you." She smiled at me. "I was just curious."</p>
<p>She gave me a hug and dropped away from me slowly, giving my hand a squeeze. "I gotta hit the shower. Tell your girlfriend to cut the shit, she nearly got us in a whole world of trouble."</p>
<p>I snickered and slapped her ass as she attempted to dodge and darted from the room.</p>
<p>That night, as she laid in my bed, spooned up against me with her delicious ass wedged up against my cock, she asked "When did you know? That things were different with us, I mean? That you felt... more."</p>
<p>"I'm not a hundred percent sure."</p>
<p>"Was it when you woke up with me like this?" Her ass wiggled a little against my cock.</p>
<p>"No, that wasn't it. But thanks for reminding me of that whole embarrassment." I chuckled.</p>
<p>"Oh, like you had forgotten all about it. Sure." I could hear the smirk, and chose to ignore it.</p>
<p>"There was this one night, a few months back... I came home and you were asleep on the sofa."</p>
<p>"The night you straightened my hair?" Despite how incredible her ass felt against me, she elected to roll over and put her arm across me instead. I started to protest, but thought better of it.</p>
<p>"You knew about that?" I was surprised.</p>
<p>"Well, I was asleep, and a felt a hand brush my hair out of my face. I just assumed it was dad. Sometimes, he does stuff like that. Just being dad. You know, I'm his little girl and all that. Anyway, I wasn't all that awake, and it took a second to open my eyes. When I did, he wasn't there. I looked over the arm of the sofa, and I saw you walking up the staircase with your book bag." She slowly moved her hand across my chest as she spoke. "I thought it was really unusual because you mostly ignore me. I mean, you used to. It was the first really loving, kind type of gesture I'd seen from you in a long time. I didn't call out to you because I didn't want to spoil it. I just enjoyed that you showed me some affection. I didn't even realize that I had been missing it so much until then. It was really nice. I felt like you cared. I had a big smile on my face for a while after that. Is that silly?"</p>
<p>"No, it's not. I'm sorry you felt like I'd been ignoring you. I had no idea you woke up. Is that all you remember from the night?"</p>
<p>"I think so. But is that the night you're talking about?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's the one." I shifted slightly so that I could reach the lamp on the nightstand. "I want you to see something."</p>
<p>As the soft light filled the room, I looked down at her and she was looking up at me. There was something in the affectionate way that her blue eyes gazed at me. It kind of took my breath away. I gazed back at her for a few seconds, lost in her face.</p>
<p>Fighting the urge to kiss her again, I finally broke eye contact to scan the desk across the room until I spotted what I was looking for. "You see the stack of sketchbooks on my desk over there? You want the third one down. The one with the blue paint on the spine."</p>
<p>"That means moving," she whined.</p>
<p>"Grab the book. I really want you to see this. I've never shown it to anyone."</p>
<p>She unfolded from me and grabbed the sketchbook from the desk. She sat in my office chair and started flipping through it. Her long, dark hair cascading across her face and tumbling down her shoulder as she bent over the sketchbook, partially obscuring my view of her face. "What am I looking for?"</p>
<p>"You'll know it when you see it."</p>
<p>There was no doubt when she found the sketch. She froze in place, just staring at the page. I wasn't sure she was breathing. Just when I started thinking that I had made a mistake in showing it to her, she looked up from it.</p>
<p>"You did this?"</p>
<p>"Well, yeah. I drew it that night. Before I did the hair thing."</p>
<p>"It's amazing." Amy looked back down at it, her eyes were still wide in fascination. "How long did it take you? I slept through the whole thing?"</p>
<p>"A few hours. I did my best not to disturb you." I stretched out, put my head on the pillow, and closed my eyes. "Anyway, you asked when I knew. That was the most defining moment I can think of. I saw you that night, asleep. In my goddamned shirt, of course. You just looked peaceful and... stunningly beautiful. I know I suck at drawing realistic images, but I felt like I had to try to capture that moment. Something about the shadows on your face, the lines of you, I don't know... It just hit me. And it turned out to be the best drawing I've ever done."</p>
<p>I felt the bed shift as she crawled back in with me and settled into my arms. "My big brother is still full of surprises."</p>
<p>"I can't believe I slept through you drawing that. It's almost like a black and white photograph of me. It's incredible, Adam." She leaned back and planted kisses on my jaw until I tipped my head down so she could meet my lips.</p>
<p>"What about you?" I asked when we eventually came up for air.</p>
<p>"Well, let's see..." She lay her head down on my chest, her fingers tracing designs that only she could see across my stomach. "Part of me, I think, always knew."</p>
<p>"Oh, come on, that's a weak answer."</p>
<p>"No, not like that. Hear me out." She continued. "Lots of little girls get crushes on their older brothers or their fathers growing up. It's part of the process of maturing into an emotional adult. Their brother is the first male they become familiar with, the one that is their protector and keeps them safe from the thunder and lightning, the tornadoes, the dark, whatever it is they are afraid of. Until he matures enough to be too good to hang out with his little sister anymore and takes off to the skate park at every opportunity, that is."</p>
<p>"I can see that, but I think your answer is a bit of a cop out." I elected to ignore the skate park comment.</p>
<p>"Let me finish, would you?"</p>
<p>"Okay, I'm shutting up."</p>
<p>"That was part of it. But that stuff has always kind of been in the back of my mind. Like when I told you that you were in my fantasies sometimes." She locked eyes with me again, and let her hand graze my cheek affectionately. "I always came hardest if I was wearing one of your shirts. They smelled like you and it just kind of brought me into the fantasy more."</p>
<p>I swallowed hard and made a mental note to quit bitching about her stealing my shirts all the time.</p>
<p>"Laying here in your bed the past few months, I'd get so turned on watching you paint. Something about the way your hands move over the canvases, it can be hypnotic to watch. You have an intensity to your movements when you are really focused on it. I don't know why it gets me going so much sometimes, but it really does. I used to wonder so much what it would feel like to have your hands moving over me like that." She grabbed my arm and placed my hand on her breast over her shirt. "And now I know." She was smiling as I took the hint and groped her a bit while she continued.</p>
<p>"But that's the lust part, I guess. I had felt something more for you for a while before, but I think I first realized I was actually in love with you at the park. Those guys came over and started hitting on me while you were cooking. They were cute and seemed nice, but when I considered the idea of giving one of them my number, I didn't want to. And I thought about why that was. I looked over at you, your back was to me, and my stomach got butterflies. It just hit me out of nowhere that I didn't want them. I wanted the guy that I felt more at peace and comfortable with than I ever had. I wanted the guy who made me feel safe, who went and beat the shit out of an asshole twice his size without asking anything in return just because he knew that the guy had hurt me. I realized that you were the most amazing guy I had ever met. I knew I was in love with you. I knew I wasn't supposed to be and I don't know how it happened. But that didn't make it less true. I just didn't know what to do about it."</p>
<p>"I was really irritated with those pricks." I chuckled. "Can't tell you how relieved I was when you sent them packing."</p>
<p>"Really?" She asked, as she crawled up on all fours, adopting a cat-like pose, in order to kiss my throat. Her hair cascaded across my face and shoulder, it tickled a little, but I didn't mind at all. She was so effortlessly sexy that it was unreal to me. "I didn't notice that at all."</p>
<p>"I was trying really hard to hide it. I couldn't even look that direction until I heard them walking away. I was going nuts. It's not like I had any right to say anything about it."</p>
<p>"But now you do, baby." Amy sighed into my ear. "Because I'm all yours now."</p>
<p>My cock and my heart both jolted at her last statement. I wrapped my hand around the back of her head and brought her lips to mine in a long kiss, caressing her breast with the other. She groaned into my mouth and moved her hips closer against me. Pushing her away from me slightly, which earned me a brief look of confusion, I rolled us over until I was on top of her. Her confused look vanished, to be replaced with desire again as she felt my erection pressed against her thigh.</p>
<p>I began kissing my way down her neck, lifting her shirt with my hands until my mouth reached the collar of her shirt. She allowed me to pull her shirt over her head and drop it on the edge of the bed, once again exposing her beautiful, creamy breasts to me. I wanted to put my dick between them, but that would be saved for another day. My hands slid down her sides, exploring every curve of her body as my mouth licked, nibbled, and sucked its way across her tits. Her hands were running through my hair, guiding my mouth toward the nipple it was searching for. I cupped her breast in my hand, gently squeezing it as I licked her nipple lovingly before pulling it into my mouth. She gasped sharply, and held my head to her breast. After a while, I moved to the other one to provide it with similar treatment, and was rewarded with an identical gasp. I began planting a series of kisses and small licks down her chest to her stomach, my hands sliding down to hook into the waist of her boxers, sliding them down her hips.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, my baby sister lay completely naked before me. She seemed to stiffen a little, but somewhat obviously tried not to, and it occurred to me that she was uncomfortable. I paused what I was doing to look up at her face. Her eyes met mine, and I saw a hint of worry in her eyes. I had never seen the look on her face that she gave me at that moment, a particular look of shy vulnerability that only seems to exist between new lovers.</p>
<p>"Do you like what you see?" she asked, shyly, sounding almost intimidated. I let my eyes wander over her naked form, taking in the full and inviting curves of her breasts, her taunt stomach, the swell of her hips, her hairless mound. I marveled at how she alternated so often between seeming to be confident and seductive versus sounding insecure and vulnerable.</p>
<p>"Are you kidding me? You look completely ravishing." I leaned up to whisper in her ear, "I want to taste every part of you. Every single part. You are so fucking beautiful, baby."</p>
<p>She whimpered in response, and I felt her body relax again. "God, I love you."</p>
<p>"I love you, too." I responded as I began kissing her stomach lightly, watching in fascination as it fluttered when my lips grazed its surface. She gasped a little with each kiss, clearly enjoying my explorations. Throughout my mouth's expedition across her naked form, Amy kept one arm draped over her face, while the other drifted across my head and shoulder as I slowly retreated from her reach.</p>
<p>My lips continued to kiss down her body, along the outside of her hip. I could hear the disappointment in her moans that I had passed over her pussy. I had kissed my way to her knee and reversed my direction, working my way up the inside of her thigh. With each kiss as I moved closer to her sex, I kissed more lightly than the time before. Her breathing was increasing dramatically and she let out a groan every time my lips touched her. By the time I reached the base of her thigh, I didn't even allow my lips to touch her. I gave her upper thigh a quick lick and blew hot air over it after. She arched her back achingly, trying to push her hips up toward me. I backed away, preventing her pelvis from touching me, causing her to whine in frustration. My hands slid down to her hips, pinning her lightly to the bed as I lowered my face to her pussy, lightly passing my tongue ever so gently along the outer edge of her already wet lips. She tried to raise her hips again, but I had her locked in place.</p>
<p>"You're killing me." she groaned at me. I expelled a breath of hot air over her slit in response, causing her to growl at me adorably. I could smell her desire for me and it was making it exceedingly hard for me to continue my teasing ritual as my mouth desperately wanted to worship her. Her hand suddenly slipped down, briefly obstructing my view as she started to rub herself. I pulled the hand away and was rewarded with a low growl of serious frustration.</p>
<p>"Baby, I'm dying here." She pouted, as she tried to bring her hand back around again. In response, I simply took her hand and tucked it under her ass. She whined in protest, but didn't try it again.</p>
<p>I proceeded to kiss my way down her other thigh, moving away from her pussy, which clearly frustrated her further. I allowed myself to get about halfway down her thigh, before I lifted away from her and moved directly to her pussy and planted a long lick directly to her slit, keeping my tongue wide and flat, starting at the bottom and gliding up to the hood of her clit. She let out a seriously loud moan of pleasure that I was fairly sure the entire house could have heard. I snatched a pillow and shoved it over her face before she even finished expelling the moan. She instantly wrapped her arms around the pillow, understanding my panic. I returned to licking her pussy, focusing my energy on licking small circles around the hood that housed her clitoris, with occasional dip to lick the juices that were seeping from her slit. Her taste was intoxicating. I could have stayed there and drank her essence for hours.</p>
<p>Within a few short minutes, I felt her thighs begin to quiver and I could tell she was approaching her orgasm. Her muffled cries were nearly escaping the pillow's confines, as her excitement built under my touch. Remembering the sound of her orgasm the night before, part of me really resented that pillow, but it was all that kept us from being caught. I raised my tongue up to her clitoris and using the tip of my tongue like a pen, I began spelling out my feelings for her across her clitoris and hood. She bucked wildly against me, nearly screaming into her pillow as her orgasm overtook her. I abandoned her clitoris, correctly assuming that she was going to be too sensitive for me to continue stimulating it. Instead, I focused on lapping up her precious fluids as her orgasm subsided. She continued to shudder every couple of seconds as I licked her clean.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>After a while, she dropped the pillow from her face and mumbled "Jesus, you are amazing."</p>
<p>I scooted up next to her and cradled her against me. She curled up in my arms, making no attempt to cover herself, instead clutching my arms against her as if she thought she were about to fall off of a building.</p>
<p>"How do you do that to me?" she mumbled rhetorically as she nuzzled my neck. "No one's ever made me come that hard."</p>
<p>I didn't answer. I just held her and savored the taste of her that still lingered in my mouth while she basked in the afterglow of her orgasm. I was just starting to doze off when she spoke.</p>
<p>"That wasn't the earliest notion you had about me, you know."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"The night you drew me. That wasn't the first time you had thoughts about me." She wasn't stating it like a question.</p>
<p>"Oh really?" I wasn't exactly confused, but I was curious where she was headed with this.</p>
<p>"Don't get me wrong, I love that you drew me. You can do that anytime you like. In fact, I hope that you do. But there were times before that." Her lips were right up against my ear canal and she was whispering so softly I could barely make out her words. "I've caught you staring at my ass for years now."</p>
<p>"I need to work on my subtlety."</p>
<p>"I don't need your jokes right now, dear brother." Her tongue took a quick tour of the crease behind my ear before she continued her whispers. "You've stared at my ass for years, when you thought I wasn't going to notice."</p>
<p>She lifted my shirt off of me and pulled her naked form close to my bare chest. I could feel her bare breasts against me and took a sharp intake of breath as her nipples grazed me. She had an uncanny ability to make my body forget that it needed things like air and blood circulation. Her lips snapped back to my ear again. "You never wondered why I started wearing tights when I'd come visit you in your room? You enjoyed the view, I knew that."</p>
<p>Amy draped a long sexy leg across my torso and pulled my hand up to caress her naked thigh.</p>
<p>"I saw you" she breathed in my ear, "...adjusting your package when you thought I wasn't looking. I know you love looking at my ass."</p>
<p>"Yes." I replied, simply. No point in denying it.</p>
<p>Pulling her hair back from her neck to allow me access, she presented her long, gorgeous throat for me to kiss. I gladly obliged, as she continued her whispers. "I love the feel of your lips on my neck. And I love you looking at my ass, you know. I kept hoping you'd slip and grab it one of the times I hugged you. But you never did."</p>
<p>Not that the thought hadn't occurred to me, I thought, as I smiled into the hollow of her throat. I'd been tempted to do a great many things to her ass, grabbing it being among the most tame.</p>
<p>"Would you ever have told me how you felt?" She asked my ear, beginning to breath a little quicker as my lips did their work on her neck and throat.</p>
<p>I didn't reply for a while, considering it as I savored the feel of her flesh. "No. I don't think I would have. I would probably have carried it to my grave."</p>
<p>"I thought so." She replied with a hint of sorrow in her voice. "You can be so shy sometimes. But that would have been a really sad way to live. I hate to think of you suffering like that."</p>
<p>"The alternative was too terrifying to contemplate." She'd wanted honesty, she was going to get it.</p>
<p>"Having a pretty girl sitting your lap, naked, and all but pleading for you to touch her is terrifying?" Her breath was hot against my neck, a low moan slipping out as my hand found her nipple and started playing with it. It immediately hardened against my palm.</p>
<p>"No, but having your little sister, who is stunningly beautiful and who you are hopelessly in love with, absolutely despise you for being the degenerate, perverse asshole that you are is completely terrifying. Not to mention that she freaks out so much about it that your parents get wind of it and you now live in your car under the overpass by the junk yard."</p>
<p>"Well, when you put it that way..." A raspy moan escaped her as my teeth dragged lightly over an erect nipple. "...I can see where you are... coming from." She let out a whimper of appreciation for my lips and tongue. "But it didn't turn out that way. It turned out so much better than that."</p>
<p>She smiled warmly, took my face in her hands, and gave me one more deep, lingering kiss and then shoved herself up and off of me, sliding down the bed to unbutton my shorts.</p>
<p>"I wanted to do this last night, and someone distracted me." She said as she pulled my shorts down and massaged my erection through my boxers with her hands. Her long delicate fingers wrapped around my shaft and gave it a few strokes. Her touch made my cock twitch as if it had been electrocuted.</p>
<p>"You have such a nice cock." She said in a somewhat dreamlike manner.</p>
<p>"Thanks, I guess." I mumbled, as I'd never really had much of a response when a girl commented on my dick. It had happened a few times, and I always felt like the very definition of awkward when trying to formulate a reply. I'd never had complaints about it, but I always assumed it to be an average size. The most noteworthy thing about it, in my estimation, was that I had a small extra bit of skin behind the head, scar tissue left behind from circumcision as an infant. It was a tiny bit of skin, but had the nice perk of adding a bit of extra stimulation for the girl while having sex. That was the only reason I'd never had it cleaned up at the doc's office.</p>
<p>Amy slid my boxers down my hips and gripped my shaft again. I relished the feeling of my little sister's hands on my cock as she gave it several strokes before cupping my balls in one hand and starting to kiss the head of my erect member. She swirled her tongue around the head, pressing her tongue into every crevice she found. She discovered the scar and purred a little at it, sensing the possibilities, I supposed. Her lips kissed it, then she sucked on the scar tissue for a second before giving my full length a long, greedy lick. I felt her mouth slowly surround the head of my cock and begin descending. She took about a third of it into her mouth and then retreated, blowing me in slow, methodical strokes. By the time she began picking up her pace, she was taking almost of half of me in her mouth. She steadily stroked the remainder of my shaft with her hands as she worked her mouth over me, making sure no part of me felt neglected.</p>
<p>I lost all sense of the room around me, every fiber of my being focused on Amy's mouth as she bobbed her head over my cock. I couldn't quite wrap my head around the mind blowing realization that my little sister was giving me head. It may have explained why it felt stronger and more urgent than any blow job I had ever gotten in the past. I wanted to feel her take me in completely, I wanted to hold her head and shove my cock down her throat. I resisted, though. My beautiful little sister was doing this for me and I wasn't about to ruin the experience for her. She took me another inch further in her mouth, passing over a particularly sensitive area of my shaft and I gasped audibly when she did.</p>
<p>Taking the hint, she quickened her pace and depth, attempting to go deeper but triggered her gag reflex and had to stop a moment to cough a couple of times and drool some spit on my shaft. Catching her breath, she went back to work in earnest. She swallowed me a little bit further with each few passes over my cock, but I could feel myself hitting the back of her mouth and could see her eyes watering. She made a couple of obscene gulping noises as she worked, which turned me on immensely. I felt my balls tightening up and tapped her shoulder to tell her I was close.</p>
<p>Amy looked up to lock eyes with me as her mouth redoubled its efforts on my cock. She gasped for air and dropped a big dollop of spit on my dick, which she massaged into my shaft with her hands. Her eyes never left mine. A lock of hair fell across her face, I hooked a finger under it and tucked it behind her ear. Her eyes closed momentarily in appreciation and fondness, but opened again moments later and sought my own. She clearly wanted to me to look at her when I finished.</p>
<p>"Come for me, big brother. Do it. I want to swallow everything you give me." She gasped, gulping for air with desperation. My shaft disappeared back into her mouth, and I groaned again. I felt my body tense a little and without thinking my hands moved to her head, guiding her movements. In my increasingly maddening lust, I narrowly managed to avoid shoving her head down on my entire length, unwilling to hurt her. She bobbed her head fast, eyes still locked on mine. I felt my balls tighten up and the unmistakable sensation of my semen rocketing to my shaft. My hips bucked involuntarily as the first stream of my come hit the back of her throat. She gulped hard, trying to keep up as each stream of semen invaded her mouth, moaning in excitement and making obscene noises with each pulse.</p>
<p>I felt like I had never come so much in my life, and she swallowed every drop as though her very life depended on it, milking my cock dry with her hand as she did so. When she was finally satisfied that I was fully drained, she kissed the head of my cock a couple of times and slid back up next to me, her nipples grazing my body as she crawled up to my arms, wrapping herself around my chest. Even in my sated state, the feel of her nipples gliding over my flesh felt intensely erotic.</p>
<p>"I love the way you taste," she purred into my chest, a bit winded. She started licking the spit and a few errant drops of come from her hand with sensuous relish.</p>
<p>"That was incredible." I was still trying to catch my breath, as well. "Seriously."</p>
<p>"I couldn't take you all in." She pouted a little. "But I will. Just give me time. I'm gonna deep throat that thing."</p>
<p>"I'm looking forward to seeing you practice." I chuckled softly. I should have felt guilty. My baby sister had just swallowed my come. We had crossed way beyond what was normal sibling behavior at this point. I should have felt more shame than I did. But something about her felt so much more right than any girl I been with. I felt so lucky to have her. The thought of losing her made my chest ache. I hoped that I would never have to face that.</p>
<p>While pricing stacks of CDs at work a few days later, I received a call from the art gallery informing me that three of my pieces had sold, including the so called erotic painting. They asked if I had some other work I would like to show in the newly opened space and to make arrangements for me to collect my $2700 payment. I was floored, as it was more money than I had ever made from all of the art that I had sold previously combined. Amy was in classes until early afternoon, but I sent her a text anyway.</p>
<p>As soon as my shift ended, I drove to the hardware store to buy more framing materials. I kept myself busy for the rest of the afternoon framing up a few other paintings that I thought were suitable for the gallery. After delivering the paintings and collecting payment, I returned home to nearly be tackled to the ground at my bedroom by a seriously excited little sister. I think she was more excited about my art sales than I was.</p>
<p>All through dinner that night, she beamed at me and kept bringing it up to our parents. She seemed so genuinely proud of me. For their part, mom offered polite interest while our father only grunted in response. True to form, he had zero interest in the goings on of his son, the middle of the road student with no interest in sports. It didn't bother me at all anymore, I'd known for many years that Amy was his favorite and long since come to terms with it.</p>
<p>That night, like every night, she hung out in my bedroom, watching me work on a canvas. In the wake of the things she had told me in the dark, we both were fully aware that her watching me paint had taken on a slightly different context. Knowing that she found it erotic to watch me work, I found that my paintings started to incorporate more sensual imagery. It was all very buried and subtle, similar to the painting I'd sold at the gallery. In truth, I was perplexed that she found it sexy to watch me paint, but I really enjoyed knowing that I could turn her on regardless.</p>
<p>It was a little harder to concentrate on the painting process, since I found myself sneaking glances at her out of the corner of my eye for signs of arousal. We didn't really talk about it, but she spotted me watching her, and made a game of feigning disinterest. I caught her looking a little flushed once, despite her best attempts to look fully engaged in the magazine she was reading with the tiniest hint of a smile on her face. Eventually, I decided, it was for the best that she didn't become more overt about watching me, because I'd never get anything done. It would be too distracting.</p>
<p>As soon as I'd finished painting for the night and began cleaning my brushes, she walked out of the room and verified that our parents had gone to sleep. Slipping back into the room, she marched directly up to me and smothered me in a heavy kiss.</p>
<p>"They really need to go out of town again." She grumbled. "I hate going back to my bed alone at night."</p>
<p>"I don't like it either, but I also like having my nuts remain attached to my body." That made her smile a little.</p>
<p>"They need to stay attached, definitely. I have plans for them." She replied, giving them a soft squeeze.</p>
<p>It would be another three weeks before we were finally able to spend the night together. That didn't mean that she wasn't in my room every night, even if only for a few minutes. We spent the majority of those night in various stages of undress, enjoying each others' bodies at almost every opportunity. But we never had sex. It was unspoken, but seemingly understood between us that we couldn't do that when we ran the risk of being walked in on. I suspected that we both knew that we'd lose ourselves in the moment and take too many risks. As it stood, it was all I could do to keep her quiet when I went down on her, which was often.</p>
<p>We bordered on being inseparable outside of my bedroom as well, although we tried to keep ourselves in check. If mom asked me to run pick up something for her at the store, Amy would often make up an excuse to ride with me. If she laying on the sofa, watching a movie in the living room, I would be found sitting on the floor in front of the sofa drawing in a sketchbook. We wouldn't be touching or sneaking a kiss while someone looked away, we weren't stupid about it. But the gravitational pull between us seemed to demand that we be near each other at every available moment. We even had a few mock arguments about something trivial, using our lifelong roles as siblings to craft obnoxious jabs at each other as we had done from the time we could walk, except these arguments were done with an odd twinkle in our eyes and all of the venom we spat at each other was completely ineffectual to us. Not that it didn't look good to the outside viewer.</p>
<p>The weekend that our parents finally went out of town again turned out to be the last before the fall semester started. At Amy's insistence, I would be returning to school to continue pursuing my visual arts degree. Of course, I would be returning to Dr. Miller's class, but was a bit less apprehensive after the talk we'd had at the gallery.</p>

<p>Part 3.</p>
<p>That Friday, our parents left in the early afternoon for their trip. The night before, I had told Amy that I felt it was overdue for me to take her on a real date. I made reservations for us at an Italian restaurant in the next town over that I'd read good reviews of online. It was an hour's drive each way, but I didn't want to run into anyone that knew us, as I was determined to make the night special for her.</p>
<p>I dressed wore a charcoal gray dress shirt and khakis, as I didn't own a lot in the way of dress clothes. Honestly, what did she see in me? She owned a wardrobe that filled her closet to the brim and routinely had to get rid of a few dresses and other apparel to make room for new things. I waited in my room, listening to music on the computer, while she got ready. I was getting fidgety and changing songs every minute or so, unable to find anything I was interested in listening to at the moment. I'd just about given up on finding anything worth hearing when Amy turned up in the doorway.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?" She was dressed in a dark red blouse that was low cut and exposed a fair bit of her cleavage and tight black skirt that appeared to be painted on to her hips and ass. Her hair framed her face perfectly, falling well past her shoulders now and her make up was perfect. She had clearly put a lot of work into her look tonight and it had paid off. She stood in the doorway with her hands folded together at her waist as she looked at me, a shy smile on her face. I found myself marveling at her ability to look both very classy and unbelievably sexy at the same time.</p>
<p>"Fuck me." I mumbled almost beneath my breath at the sight of her, drawing out the first word, having to remind myself yet again that breathing was important. The effect she had on me was one of the great mysteries of my life. But it was one I was grateful for.</p>
<p>Her smile transformed from shy to a self-satisfied smirk.</p>
<p>"Oh, I plan on it." She said in her most seductive voice as she sashayed over to wrap me in a hug, her hips swaying with every step. Her lips lifted up close to my own and she whispered almost directly into my mouth. "Just not quite yet."</p>
<p>"My boyfriend promised to take me out for Italian." She said as she dropped away from me, never actually letting our lips touch. Her eyes danced mischievously across my face. She looked quite pleased with herself for teasing me, which made her all the more adorable to me. "I'm getting hungry."</p>
<p>The restaurant had exactly the pleasant, romantic atmosphere that I was hoping for. It was in a dark brick building, softly lit, with beautiful wood furniture and candles on the tables. The whole place felt warm, inviting and the smells in the air were mouth watering. It felt really different to be able to walk into the restaurant with Amy, as my girlfriend, and not as my little sister. Sitting next to her, holding her hand in public, while we waited for our table to be ready was such a unique feeling that I don't think either of us were in a hurry to be seated. She squeezed my hand affectionately and had a permanent smile plastered on her face.</p>
<p>"This is so nice," she sighed, leaning her head gently on my shoulder, still unwilling to let go of my hand. "Thank you for this."</p>
<p>"You deserve it," I replied.</p>
<p>"I love you." She sighed quietly as she planted a tiny kiss just below where my jaw met my ear.</p>
<p>The hostess arrived to seat us at exactly that moment, smiling apologetically for interrupting the kiss that Amy was giving me.</p>
<p>Throughout the meal, Amy's eyes shone at me. She had a small smile plastered on her face that almost never faltered. I could tell that she really enjoyed the attention and being able to be out in public without having to pretend like we were just siblings. Which was exactly what I had hoped for her. I have always been a more or less quiet and reserved kind of person. I knew it was harder for her to keep her feelings under wraps than it was for me. That being said, I caught myself smiling more than once.</p>
<p>As for the food, it was incredible. I had to catch myself before I started licking the plate clean right there in the restaurant. Amy felt the same way about hers and we vowed to come back.</p>
<p>On the ride home, Amy draped her arm across my car seat and started slowly running her fingers through my hair as I drove. She was being a lot quieter than at the restaurant. I glanced at her a few times as I drove and she was leaning back in her seat with her eyes closed each time. I would have thought she was asleep except for her hand lightly massaging my head and neck.</p>
<p>After a while, she slid closer to me and draped my arm over her. Snuggling up against me as I attempted to drive.</p>
<p>"If we get in a wreck, this will be hard to explain."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you'll manage," she replied. It was the first words out of her mouth in about fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>A few more minutes of silence followed. She moved a bit and I felt her lips on my neck. Then I felt something wet drip on my neck. I brought my hand up to her cheek and felt the line of a tear.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, baby?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Sorry," she said, pulling away from me to wipe her face. "I didn't mean to cry."</p>
<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"I'm just... I.." she faltered, "I'm a little scared is all."</p>
<p>"Of what?"</p>
<p>"Change, I guess. I mean, everything's kind of turned on end. Tonight kind of reminded me of that."</p>
<p>I sensed what she meant and felt my chest tighten. I took my arm from around her and put it back on the steering wheel. She sat up a little bit and glanced at me before staring out into the night.</p>
<p>"Are you having second thoughts?" I asked, my mouth starting to dry. "You think we should stop this?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't stop this if I wanted to, Adam." She took my arm in both of hers, gripping it so tightly to her that I felt the circulation slowing. "And I don't want to. I'm not scared of us."</p>
<p>I dropped my captive arm to her thigh, as she continued to hug herself to it.</p>
<p>"Me either." I sighed a little in relief.</p>
<p>"It doesn't scare you, though? Living in secret forever?"</p>
<p>"I've always thought we wouldn't stay here. If you stick it out with me, I mean. I thought we'd go somewhere that no one knows us. Start over, kind of. Then the only secret would be our old lives, not our new one." I gave voice to the half formed idea I'd had kicking around in my skull for a couple of months now.</p>
<p>"I love sound of that." She responded. "It's still a little scary, though. And our parents. They'll never forgive us. This will crush them."</p>
<p>"Probably. And that's the hardest part, to be honest. I mean, dad doesn't think much of me anyway. But he adores you." I chuckled bitterly to myself. "Man, it would really boil his piss to find out the black sheep was banging his little princess."</p>
<p>"You're no black sheep." She admonished me, passing the back of her hand along my cheek lovingly. "And you haven't banged your little princess yet, either."</p>
<p>"Mine, huh?"</p>
<p>"Yep. Yours." There was zero hint of uncertainty in her voice.</p>
<p>"I can live with that, I guess." I shrugged, trying for a little humor in the face of such a sobering declaration that made me want to pull over to the side of the road right there and take care of some highly unsavory black sheep-like business.</p>
<p>"Always a jackass." She tried to sound venomous but it wasn't working. "I'm sitting here telling you that I belong to you, and your response is to tell me you 'can live with that' you 'guess'."</p>
<p>"Sorry." I laughed, but her words ensured that my cock was now engaged in a painful battle with the zipper of my pants. I saw a sign for a rest stop a mile ahead, and accelerated the car a bit.</p>
<p>"You don't sound sorry," she tried to sound like she was pouting, but she was fooling no one. I had her amused and she knew it.</p>
<p>"You've had me at your mercy since we were little kids." I toyed at placating her. "And I'm pretty sure you know it."</p>
<p>She drew my hand down from her thigh to rest above her panties, pulling her skirt up as she went, making sure that my hand felt the warm dampness below them. "True, but you didn't used to make this happen every time I saw you in those days."</p>
<p>It took every amount of self control I had to stay on the road. I lightly massaged her slit through her panties as I drove, rewarded with little gasps and moans from the passenger seat.</p>
<p>"Now who's a damned tease?" she purred seductively. I resolutely refused to look her direction and kept my eyes on the road, determined to keep us from getting in a wreck. Amy kept one arm locked around mine, holding my hand in place, as the other slid under her blouse and back playing with her breast. I swallowed hard and kept driving, my cock straining against my pants for all it was worth.</p>
<p>"I love your hands." she gasped in a hoarse whisper, "I love the way you feel me."</p>
<p>The sound of her voice was killing me. I swear she was the sexiest creature on the planet. I felt her shift the fabric of her panties aside and slid my middle finger into her. She let out a loud gasp and started kissing my upper arm, encouraging me as I slid my finger in and out of her. Her hips raised up and tilted toward me, giving my hand better access to her. I felt her grinding her body against my arm, clinging to me for dear life.</p>
<p>I pulled into the rest stop, taking note of the fact that the parking area was nearly empty. I could see only two other vehicles in the main parking area with a few truckers parked closer to the exit, taking their required naps. I parked in a far corner, as far away from the other vehicles as I could and as fast as I could unbuckle my seat belt she was on me.</p>
<p>Her mouth slammed into mine hungrily, our tongues in a war for dominance. She crushed herself against me as hard as she could, our bodies aching for one another with a magnetism like I had never felt before. I felt my lower lip split, crushed under her assault and tasted the saltiness of blood in my mouth. She pulled away after a moment, breathless, with a slight red smear on her lower lip and chin.</p>
<p>"Oh baby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you." She half-whispered as she licked the blood from her lip. She reached for her purse to grab a napkin but I stopped her.</p>
<p>"It's fine. I'll live." I replied, pulling her back in my tight embrace. "Unless a little blood creeps you out."</p>
<p>Her mouth closed on my lower lip in reply, gently sucking it clean, before she buried her face in my neck and purred "It just gives me another part of you to taste, is all."</p>
<p>She moved further across the seat, climbing into my lap, kissing my neck. I kissed her neck and shoulders in return, leaving a row of little red dots at first that I went back and licked away gently with my tongue. I slid my hand back under her skirt, cupping her ass in my palm, gliding my thumb into her. I felt one of my fingers slide across her rosebud, which made my dick throb at the thought of how intimately I was touching her. She gasped under my touch and began to moan into my shoulder as she wrapped her arms around me.</p>
<p>"Oh god, Adam. Yes!" She ground her ass into my crotch as she rocked back from my hand before sliding back forward to meet it, establishing a rhythm of fucking my thumb.</p>
<p>"You want to belong to me?" I asked, my own voice dropping into a harsh, throaty whisper.</p>
<p>"I already... uhnnn... belong to you!" she replied, whimpering between gasps. "I'm so yours, baby."</p>
<p>"Do you want a life with me, away from here? A new life?"</p>
<p>"God, yes!'</p>
<p>Her breath was quickening, strained squeaks punctuating her breath as she exhaled. She continued to fuck my thumb with her hips, my forefinger gliding back and forth over her asshole with every stroke. Her wetness was leaking down into my palm and between her ass cheeks as she rocked. The whole situation was incredibly sexy to me, despite me not being in an ideal position to achieve my own release. This beautiful girl, my beautiful little sister, was so turned on and about to have her orgasm here in my arms. It turned me on tremendously just seeing her getting off like this. And her voice, her sexy goddamned voice, was an endless fuel to my desire for her.</p>
<p>"I want you to come for me." I whispered urgently. I wanted... I needed to hear her orgasm. I loved the sounds she made when she came. I rotated my thumb inside her slightly. My free hand slid to the small of her back and guided her into my palm over and over. Her moans were building to a fevered pitch in the confines of the car.</p>
<p>I felt her nails digging into my shoulders, and her legs clamped tight around my hand locking us in place. Her whole body shuddered in my lap as her climax overtook her. It was glorious to hear her cries. When she finally relaxed into me, I kissed her gently as I pulled my hand from beneath her. She sighed at the loss of contact with my hand, and opened her eyes halfway to look at me.</p>
<p>"Like that?" she giggled.</p>
<p>"Yeah, exactly like that." I kissed her forehead and started the car. With a sigh of disappointment, she slid back into the passenger seat.</p>
<p>"I thought you'd take me right here."</p>
<p>"I considered it, but do you really want to have sex with me for the first time in the front seat of a Honda? Or twenty minutes from now somewhere much more comfortable?" I asked.</p>
<p>"You have a point." She admitted, while attempting to give me another pouting look. "But your admirable self control is bad for my ego."</p>
<p>I leaned over and kissed her deeply.</p>
<p>"I'm sure your ego will survive, sweetheart." I backed the car out and got us headed back down the interstate toward home.</p>
<p>We had barely reached the speed limit before I felt her hand snake across my groin and give my shaft a light squeeze.</p>
<p>"I can't wait to finally feel that thing inside me." She said in the most seductive voice she could manage.</p>
<p>"You are really trying to make sure it's a short evening, aren't you?" I asked with some amusement, trying to ignore my cock's straining in my pants.</p>
<p>"It doesn't feel very short to me," she purred as she gave my full length a meaningful rub. I groaned a little against my will.</p>
<p>"Wasn't what I meant." I replied as I struggled to remain near the speed limit and avoid getting a ticket. I wanted to be home and inside her.</p>
<p>Back at home, the moment she turned to shut the front door behind us, I was on her. I slammed her forcefully against the door, kissing her hungrily, ignoring the distracting soreness of my lip. I held her body so tightly against the door that she could barely breath. She struggled to grind her hips against me, kissing me as forcefully as I was her. My hands traveled her body relentlessly, groping here and grabbing there. She had one arm around my neck, holding me to her, while her other hand grabbed my ass, trying to pull me against her harder. Her legs came up to wrap around my waist, and I lowered my arms to support her. I lifted us away from the door, allowing us room to breathe again. We were both gasping for air between moans as our mouths continued to duel each other.</p>
<p>From the way I was holding her, Amy's head was above mine, Her hair fell across my neck as she bent down to continue kissing me. I could smell her shampoo and a hint of perfume, one of those light perfumes that I'd seen described as fresh rain scented or something. Combined with her natural scent, it was intoxicating. I raised her higher and kissed her neck, planting a soft lick at the base of her throat.</p>
<p>"My god," she sighed happily above me. "I love the way you hold me."</p>
<p>I was too involved in kissing the tops of her cleavage above her blouse to reply. I had lost count of the number of times I'd buried my face between those beautiful breasts by now, but I never tired of it. She interrupted my kisses to pull her blouse over her head and wrap her arms back around me. I lowered her back to the ground, just enough for her to drop her legs from me. As soon as her feet hit the ground, I scooped her up, cradling her in my arms this time like a child. She let out a delighted laugh, which made her breasts jiggle deliciously in her black lace bra, and she hooked an arm around my neck. I thumbed the lock on the door with one hand, and carried her upstairs to my room.</p>
<p>Amy dragged her arms slowly down my body as I lowered her to the bed and immediately unzipped her skirt and dropped it on the floor along with the blouse she'd been clutching in one hand. Now clad in only her lace bra and matching panties, she parted her legs seductively toward me and motioned for me to join her. I pulled off my shirt and unbuckled my belt, taking in her beautiful form as I worked. I moved toward the bed, now clad in only my boxers when she suddenly sat up and put a hand to my stomach.</p>
<p>She slid her hand down from my stomach to my crotch, gliding over my cock and griping it slightly. Amy leaned forward and kissed my stomach, hooking her fingers into the waistband of my boxers before pulling them down. I could suddenly feel her warm breath on my erection as she nuzzled her face up against it. Her tongue snaked out and planted a lick along it's length, swirling around the head of my cock, poking her tongue around my slit. Her hand cupped my balls as she began taking me into her mouth. I groaned at the welcome sensations her mouth delivered to my cock. My eyes closed for a moment as I felt like my very being was centered on my prick, focusing all of my energies on the blow job my little sister was giving me.</p>
<p>Amy continued to take more and more of me in with each stroke, moaning appreciatively around my cock when my hand dropped to cup one of her breasts. I opened my eyes and looked down at her. The sight of her sitting on the edge of the bed with two thirds of my hard shaft gliding in and out of her mouth nearly took my breath away. She noticed the change in my breathing and looked up at me, our eyes locking for a moment. The corners of her mouth turned up a little, attempting to smile around the cock in her mouth, as she pulled back from me until only the head of my penis was still in her mouth. She took a deep breath, still holding my gaze, and glided back down over my dick, her tongue bathing the underside of it the whole way. I felt the back of her throat, then felt a tightening sensation as she kept going and my dick slid down into her throat. I let out a loud involuntary moan as her throat massaged my cock. The feeling was indescribable and I couldn't help being in awe of her. Her lips closed around the base of my shaft and she pulled back up to the end, releasing me from her mouth, She coughed as a bit of spit drooled down from her mouth.</p>
<p>"I told you I'd do it!" She gasped between breaths and looked up at me, absolutely elated. She leaned in close, jerking me off with her hand against her cheek while she caught her breath.</p>
<p>"You are goddamned amazing, baby." I replied in total appreciation.</p>
<p>As soon as she caught her breath, she grabbed my cock in her mouth and did it again, shutting off all rational thought for me. The tightness of her throat around the head of my dick made me want to grab her head and start fucking her throat with abandon. I managed to hold off, groaning aloud, as she continued to bob her head on my full length, gliding me into her throat each time. She managed to avoid gagging, but her eyes were watering and large amounts of spit were dripping from her mouth and my cock. Within a few more strokes, I could resist no longer. Lost in the sensations, my hands fell to her head when she descended, holding her in place as my hips involuntarily jerked and I launched a volley of come directly into her open throat. She made a surprised noise, but didn't resist me, holding herself in place, doing her level best to swallow around my swollen member. After the first few bursts from my exploding cock, I became coherent enough to let go of her head and she pulled away from me, keeping only the tip of my cock in her mouth. Amy continued to swallow rope after rope of my semen, allowing it to pool on her tongue before taking fast gulps, working my shaft with her small hands, and gasping for air around my cock. When I was finally spent, she released my deflating member from her mouth and wiped the spit from her chin, gazing up at me with a pleased expression.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>"I think someone enjoyed that." She smiled sexily up at me.</p>
<p>"That was unbelievable." I sighed adoringly as I sat next to her on the bed. I reached up and wiped the tears from her face with my thumbs as I framed her face in my hands. I leaned in and gave her a gentle, loving kiss. That was something I had noticed happened with us more than I'd ever experienced with any girl before. We could be intense and hungry with each other, then switch seamlessly into a more gentle, loving mood with the bat of an eye.</p>
<p>"I didn't hurt you, did I?" I asked, reflectively.</p>
<p>"No, it was fine. I mean, it did kind of hurt a little... but not in a bad way." She pulled me down to lay beside her and put her head on my chest.</p>
<p>"Sorry."</p>
<p>"Don't be. I loved it." She reached down and gave my cock an appreciative squeeze. "It's okay to be a little rough sometimes."</p>
<p>"Says the girl who left teeth marks all over my neck a while back and nearly got us caught." I grinned.</p>
<p>"It has been established that your photographer slut was responsible for that. I am innocent of all charges." She reached behind her back and popped the latch on her bra, sliding out of it in one fluid motion and dropping it on the floor. Her panties soon followed. She wrapped her naked body around mine and sighed contentedly.</p>
<p>I had been planning to make a show of rolling my eyes at her for the comment, but seeing her naked breasts again eliminated that possibility. I lay there happily taking in the feel of her naked form against mine for a few minutes. I gently stroked her hair, pulling it from her face and tucking it behind her ear. My eyes gazed over her affectionately for a long time until, finally, she tilted her head to look up at me.</p>
<p>I leaned down and kissed her. I wrapped her in my arms and raised her body on the bed, putting our heads at an even level so that I could kiss her more easily. My hand slid up her side to cup her breast and I felt a sharp exhalation of breath in my mouth for my trouble. Her mouth smiled over mine as she arched her back, forcing her tit to mash harder into my palm. She let out a loud moan when my fingers found her nipple and lightly pinched it between them. I guided her onto her back, never fully releasing her breast, and rolled up to position myself above her. Leaning down, I ran my tongue around her areola, barely allowing my tongue to graze her hardened nipple, before I closed my lips over the delightful nub and sucked it into my mouth.</p>
<p>"Oh god, yesssssss..." she hissed out as her hands grabbed at my head, her fingers running wildly through my hair.</p>
<p>I lifted my head, pulling her nipple lightly with my lips while running my tongue over the very end of it. My lips parted just enough to release her breast and for me to dive on her other nipple, repeating the treatment. Her hips raised to meet my groin as she tried to grind herself against me. The feel of her wet, white hot, hairless pussy grazing against my mostly spent, flaccid cock began to have an effect on it. I felt myself lengthening and starting to provide her with something to slide herself against.</p>
<p>Every time she would raise her hips, her back would arch a bit, causing her tits to shift up toward her face and roll slightly around on her chest. It was almost mesmerizing to watch. I seized her hips in my hands and ground my groin against her, feeling the head of my dick part her folds as it slipped in about half an inch. Realizing what was about to happen, I moved my crotch away from hers.</p>
<p>"What?" she asked, breathlessly.</p>
<p>"Reality." I sighed heavily as my face sank between her tits, hugging her chest to my face. I suddenly found myself asking myself if this was really happening. I was holding my beautiful, naked, baby sister in my arms, my face buried between her breasts, and was on the verge of sliding my cock into parts of her that no brother should ever know anything about much less have access to. This was so far beyond what was normal, acceptable sibling behavior.</p>
<p>This was the last line to cross between us. It was a feeble line, at best, considering all of the other things we had done together at this point. I knew what I wanted, but I felt like I had to give her one last chance to back out. It was so fucking wrong, and yet I wanted it with every fiber of my being. Part of me had long since abandoned thinking of her as my sister. My love for her was far beyond that now. But she was still my sister, my flesh and blood. I felt foolish for what I had to ask her, but I felt like it had to be asked.</p>
<p>I must have been locked in these thoughts for longer than I realized because I became aware that she was staring at me intently. I propped myself up on an elbow and smoothed her hair back against her head with my other arm, trying to give her a reassuring, loving stare. Her hands were resting on my shoulders before I moved, and she moved one to cup over the hand that was now lovingly caressing her cheek. She was still breathing hard, but was making no move toward me, clearly unsure of what had been going through my mind.</p>
<p>"Amy..." I tried to find the words that I needed to come out. "Is this what you want?"</p>
<p>"Of course it is." She replied, as her eyes closed and she nuzzled her face to my palm. "Don't you want me?"</p>
<p>"More than anything, sweetheart. I know it probably sounds stupid after everything we've already done, but if you really want this, I need to hear you say it " I ran my thumb gently along her eyebrow as she turned her face toward my palm, half burying it and giving it a quick, playful lick. That derailed my train of thought for a half second. She could be so adorably intoxicating, unlike anyone I had ever known.</p>
<p>She cocked an eyebrow at me and grinned mischievously.</p>
<p>"Are you trying to get me to beg for your dick? Is that a thing for you?"</p>
<p>I pulled my hand from her face to cover my own in a mixture of frustration and mild amusement. To say nothing of the fact that the idea of her begging for my dick did kind of add an extra couple of milliliters of blood to my erection.</p>
<p>"I could try it, if it's something you really need. Begging for your dick, I mean. I can be a team player, after all." She dropped her voice to a sexy whisper, wrapping her hand around my cock as she finished her sentence. It was hard to be annoyed in the face of that.</p>
<p>"That wasn't what I was talking about, and you know it." I tried to sound stern as her small hand stroked the length of my shaft.</p>
<p>"I know," Amy replied. "But it's fun to annoy you."</p>
<p>"Brat." I slid myself down a bit on her body allowing my mouth access to her tits.</p>
<p>"Jackass." She breathed as my mouth closed over one of her divine nipples, my tongue having its way with her hardened nub. An appreciative moan followed as my hand glided along her thigh and fastened itself to one of the globes of her ass.</p>
<p>I lost myself in the feel of her body, worshiping her chest with my lips and tongue while my hands roamed along her legs, hips, ass, and ribs. Her body responded to my touch in a series of light moans, occasional gasps, and light shudders. She kept one of her hands wrapped around the back of my head, guiding me across her breasts, while her other hand slid rhythmically down my back, dragging her nails up my spine repeatedly. Her hips ground her white hot pussy against my stomach, and I had to keep fighting the intense urge to move up and slam myself into her.</p>
<p>One of my hands traveled up, pausing briefly to cup the breast my mouth wasn't currently feasting on, before continuing up along her neck and jaw line. Finally it came to rest against the side of her face, the palm resting against her cheek and my fingers barely sliding into her hair. I felt her face turn as she took my thumb in her mouth, giving it a seductive suck, breathing raggedly against it. She released my thumb and moaned something that I did not hear, as I was so lost in the feel of her wonderful body.</p>
<p>"What was that?" I asked, raising my head from her chest just slightly.</p>
<p>"Come here." She repeated.</p>
<p>I moved my arms down on either side of her and lifted myself up to be able to better move across her body. I planted little kisses, licks, and nibbles to various parts of her body as I moved my head up even with hers. She took my head in her hands and gently pulled me up to face her. Her tongue slipped out to moisten her lips as she gazed at me affectionately a moment before opening her mouth to speak.</p>
<p>"I love you," She began, keeping her beautiful piercing blue eyes locked on mine. "I love you more than I have ever loved anyone. I know that I am your sister. I know that most people think it's wrong, but it doesn't feel wrong to me. I don't have all the answers, but I know that I want this more than anything. I want my big brother to make love to me. I want his dick inside me. I want to be with him forever. I want to belong to him completely."</p>
<p>I opened my mouth to reply, but found myself temporarily at a loss for words. There was no uncertainty or hesitation in her voice. Her eyes shimmered at me, unblinking. Finally, her lips turned up in a small, shy smile.</p>
<p>"Is that saying it clearly enough for you?"</p>
<p>I nodded as her hand snaked down my abdomen, across my stomach and I felt her long delicate fingers wrap around my shaft again, giving my cock a slow stroke. She rubbed me against her clit a couple of times, using the head of my dick to tease herself, before lining me up with her entrance.</p>
<p>"I love you, Amy," I said as I gently moved my hips forward, my cock slowly sliding into her welcoming folds. She was more than ready for me, her opening glistening wet with her desire. I took my time entering her, in part because I didn't want to hurt her, and in part because the gravity of what we were doing was not lost on me. I felt like I was aware of my nerve endings to such a degree that it seemed like I could feel each cell of my penis as it was coated by her body's fluids. As I continued deeper into my little sister, I felt like time was at a standstill and my breathing ceased completely. My body yearned to crawl into hers, becoming one with her. I felt a tiny pang of disappointment when our pelvises met and she had taken all I had to give. When she had taken my full length into her, she closed her eyes and sighed happily.</p>
<p>"You're finally inside me." She giggled. "Oh god, I've wanted this for so long."</p>
<p>The giggles stopped the moment I pulled back from her and thrust in again, repeating the sensations I had felt on the first stroke. Her warm pussy gripping my cock in protest each time I withdrew. I felt her legs wrap around me, her small feet hooked on the backs of my legs pulling me toward her. She let out a whimpering cry as her legs pulled me against her a second time.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, I want this," she began chanting urgently, "I want this. I want this."</p>
<p>I found myself gasping for air, my breath quickening in response to the amazing feelings I was experiencing inside my beautiful baby sister. It had never been like this with others I had slept with. No other vagina or mouth that any woman had been kind enough to allow me to get near had ever felt anywhere near as amazing as this. I felt like her beautiful, soft pussy had been molded specifically to fit my cock. I wanted to ask her if she felt the same, but I didn't have the words. I was too lost in the experience to be able to think.</p>
<p>Amy's long slender arms were wrapped around my body in a tight embrace as our pelvises thrust toward each other in rhythmically. She held me so tight that she actually lifted from the bed at one point, my body supporting us both as she clung to me. Her mouth devoured mine, sometimes wandering to my neck, throat, and shoulders before returning back to resume the battle between our tongues. Our kisses were heated, urgent, built on a need that was months, maybe years in the making between us. The sex was no longer gentle, it was driven, our bodies slamming together in unison. Her fingernails dug into my back, as her moans gave way to wails of desire. I found myself pulling her body so tightly against mine that I worried I was hurting her and I barely summoned enough willpower to ease up on my ferociousness.</p>
<p>Amy continued to chant "I want this. I want this. I want this. I want this." over and over. She was reciting it like a mantra, exhaling the words, using gasps to refill her lungs at the end of each "this" almost like punctuation. I wasn't sure that she was fully aware she was saying the words, and as her body rushed toward her orgasm, her words became less of a sentence.</p>
<p>"I want this. I want thi- ...I want ...I want" The words poured from her mouth into my ears, her breathing becoming more and more ragged as our bodies continued to collide. "Want" sounding like a desperate plea, straining her voice with its need. Her cries were urging me toward my own orgasm as I could feel my balls tightening and the rush through my groin that told me the inevitable was on the way.</p>
<p>With a last few, almost tearful pleas of "Want... want... want..." coming from Amy's delirious mouth, her orgasm washed over her in a wave. A joyful cry, almost like a shriek, escaped her lips as her upper body flushed and she gripped me like I was all that was keeping her from certain death. I felt her warmth escalate as her body bathed my cock and balls with her oils as she came. That was all it took for my cock to surrender to her and release bursts of semen deep into her body. After the first few ropes bathed the walls of her canal, my thrusting ceased and we could both feel the pulsing of my dick as it fired a few more volleys of come into her. I lowered myself against her slowly, holding her close, remaining inside her.</p>
<p>We both were completely out of breath, sweat pouring from our bodies. When my rapidly softening cock finally fell free from her body, I rolled to lay beside her on my back, still catching my breath. I became aware that my back was stinging from where her fingernails had scratched me all along my shoulder blades. I noticed that my left ear was ringing from her screaming into it during her orgasm, and felt a little bit of an ego boost. I both loved and marveled that I had had that kind of effect on her.</p>
<p>"Holy... shit." Amy was the first to speak, after several minutes. "That was fucking incredible!"</p>
<p>"Yeah," I replied, my eyes were closed, reflecting on what had just transpired.</p>
<p>She rolled herself up against me, resting her head on my shoulder. I was immediately distracted by her bare breasts smashed against my side, although I was in no condition to do much about it just yet.</p>
<p>"I didn't know it would be like that. Wow." She spoke softly, "I love you so much."</p>
<p>I tilted my head and kissed her gently for a moment.</p>
<p>"I love you, too."</p>
<p>We both drifted to sleep shortly after.</p>
<p>When I woke up, I discovered I was alone in the bed. I glanced at the clock in the darkness and saw it was not long after midnight. I'd only slept a little over an hour, it seemed. I heard the shower running down the hall, and pondered if she would mind if I joined her. Probably not, I reasoned.</p>
<p>I sat up and was surprised when the bed sheet clung to my back before falling away with a strange pulling sensation on my skin. I looked back at the bed and saw little red dots and stripes where I had been laying. I remembered her nails on my back and thought "aw.. shit."</p>
<p>I gathered up the bed sheets and carried them downstairs to the utility room. After chucking them in the washing mashing, hoping that they'd come clean in the wash, I padded back upstairs and grabbed fresh sheets from the linen closet. I'd managed to wash acrylic paint out of the sheets more than once, hopefully I'd be just as lucky with relatively fresh blood stains.</p>
<p>Tossing the clean sheets in the general direction of the bed, I headed to the bathroom where I found the door open. Leaning in the doorway, I spent a moment watching her wash her hair through the frosted glass of the shower door. After a moment, she cracked the shower door open and looked out at me.</p>
<p>"You gonna stand there staring or are you going to join me?" She asked.</p>
<p>When I didn't immediately get in the shower, she stepped out, water dripping from her gorgeous naked form, grabbed my hand and drug me in with her.</p>
<p>"I guess I'm joining you," I laughed.</p>
<p>"Damn right, you are." She said, smiling, as she wrapped her arms around my neck. I took put my hands on her waist as I stepped under the shower head. We swayed back and forth under the water with our eyes closed, holding each other close, seemingly slow dancing together to a song that only we could hear. We gently kissed each other for a while, until I remembered that hot water was a finite thing.</p>
<p>"So, how far along are you with the soap?" I asked, picking her body wash up from the shower shelf and looking at her with a sense of purpose.</p>
<p>"If you're bathing me, we can just start over as far as I'm concerned." She grinned at me. So I did exactly that and bathed every part of her, paying particular attention to her more intimate bits. I let my hands roam over every inch of her body, thus ensuring that she had been thoroughly lathered and rinsed by the time I was finished. I found her so breathtakingly beautiful that I could have worked on cleaning her body all day and never uttered a word of complaint. When I crouched down to wash her legs, she noticed the scratches all over my shoulders.</p>
<p>"Oh shit, did I do that to you?" She exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Unless you have an angry badger stashed around here somewhere, yeah." I replied with a smirk.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Amy replied, not looking particularly apologetic. To be honest, she looked kind of pleased with herself.</p>
<p>"A smarter man than myself might suspect you have it in for me." I said, which made her laugh. She fell silent as I resumed focusing my attention on rinsing the soap off of her legs. I particularly enjoyed watching the water stream down the swell of her hips.</p>
<p>I let my hands glide up the backs of her calves and thighs as I stood, cupping the magnificent globes of her ass in my hands as I stood and kissed her. Her body shivered appreciatively. She took reached back and took one of my wrists, guiding it up so that my hand cupped her breast as she leaned up to kiss me. Her arousal, while not as driven as it had been earlier, was clearly evident. Finally, she pulled away from me and grabbed the soap.</p>
<p>"Your turn," she said as she began lathering up my chest and arms. I watched her as she methodically washed me all over, enjoying the feel of her hands on me. Her breasts hypnotically swayed as she leaned this way or that and proved to be a great distraction. The water began to cool considerably by the time she was done rinsing me off. The cool water had little effect on my erection, which drew me to her body like a divining rod.</p>
<p>I shut the water off, grabbed a towel and began drying her off. Eventually, she took over, wrapping the towel around her shoulders as she dried her hair. I grabbed a towel of my own and was drying myself when I saw her stop and stare at me with a strange little smile on her face.</p>
<p>"What?" I asked, waiting for her to point out something stupid I had done. This was usually the case when she would stop and grin at me like this.</p>
<p>"Just remembering what we did a little while ago." Her smile widened.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah? What was that?" I said, smiling back at her myself.</p>
<p>"My big brother finally put his big dick in me." She kept smiling, emphasizing that we had just committed pure incest. "And I loved every moment of it."</p>
<p>"Speaking of that," I began, bracing myself for the hit that I knew was about to come, "Does sex with you always involve chanting and bloodshed? I just wanna know what to expect. Is this some kind of occult thing?"</p>
<p>"Oh god. Don't make fun of me for that." She whined, her face blushed deep red. She buried her face in the towel around my neck in embarrassment.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"I'm just teasing, sweetheart." I replied, wrapping her in a hug and feeling a little guilty. I hadn't expected that reaction.</p>
<p>"I know, but I didn't mean to scratch you. Or say all that stuff. It's embarrassing." She mumbled into my chest.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't be embarrassed. I think it's kinda hot that I had that much of an effect on you."</p>
<p>"Really?" She looked up at me, unsure if she believed me.</p>
<p>"Seriously. It's kind of an ego boost to drive you wild like that."</p>
<p>"If you knew what kind of effect you had on me, your ego wouldn't fit in the room. And you're such a jackass as it is, can't have you getting cocky on top of it." She smiled.</p>
<p>"If I'm such a jackass, why do you love me so much?"</p>
<p>"I have terrible taste in men."</p>
<p>"Ouch." I replied as I swept her towel clad body up in my arms again and carried her back to my room. She helped me remake the bed with minimal difficulty aside from what was brought on by me popping her on the ass with my towel. That started a slight skirmish that lasted a few minutes before we got back to the task at hand. As soon as the bed was made, I was climbed back in and took her in my arms.</p>
<p>"Can it be like this for us all the time one day?" She asked, lovingly stroking my cheek with her hand.</p>
<p>"I certainly hope so." I pulled her to me in a deep, passionate kiss. It was clear by now that I was forgiven for my towel popping incident.</p>
<p>Amy was smiling again when I paused to look at her beautiful face. Her smile made me smile until I caught myself and became self conscious about it.</p>
<p>"This has been such an awesome day," she said quietly, "We went on our first date, we finally had sex, and now we can finally spend the entire night together."</p>
<p>"It really has been."</p>
<p>She rolled away from me on her side and drew her knees up. I propped myself up on one elbow, turned toward her, and stroked my other hand slowly down the length of her from shoulder to hip. It had been obvious that she wanted me to spoon her, but she didn't complain when I elected to stroke her body instead. I let my hand wander over her, sometimes just petting her body, others rubbing it harder in almost a massage motion. With her knees drawn up as they were, her ass took on almost an inverted heart shape from the angle I was laying. I ran my hand over one of those magnificent curves, my fingertips grazing the underside of her slit and then her rosebud as I drew my hand back up toward her back. She didn't say anything, but there was a perceptible change in her breathing for a moment.</p>
<p>I moved my body up behind hers, giving her the spoon she had originally wanted and began kissing her neck as my arm wrapped around her small frame. Part of my brain still marveled that I was curled up naked in bed with such a beautiful girl. She pulled my hand up and cupped it over the soft globe of her naked breast. Her nipple hardened against my touch as I gave her breast a gentle squeeze. A soft moan escaped her lips and she arched her neck a little toward my mouth. My prick, having taken notice, rose to the occasion and bumped her ass crack. She backed her ass up against me, trapping it between her ass cheeks in response. I groaned a little in appreciation and pushed forward so that my cock slid along her crack in a short stroke. That got a definite gasp out of her. I pulled my hips away from her to repeat the thrust and she moved her ass back toward me in protest. When I moved forward again, I felt myself sliding deeper between her cheeks than before as my shaft glided through her. She clenched her ass, her wonderful ass gripping my cock in place behind her. I let out a low groan and squeezed her breast, renewing my kisses to her neck. She was really gasping by now.</p>
<p>"You really do... uhnnn... love my ass, don't you?" She groaned.</p>
<p>"I love every part of you, baby." I replied, as she released her grip enough to allow me to continue grinding against her.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but you've always... oooohh... loved my ass. For years."</p>
<p>"It is a magnificent ass. I couldn't help stealing a look sometimes." I admitted.</p>
<p>"I didn't mind." She said as she gave me another clench with her cheeks. "And I certainly don't mind now."</p>
<p>"It's a good thing, because if you haven't noticed... I can't keep my eyes off of you these days." I whispered in her ear just before I nibbled lightly on her earlobe.</p>
<p>"I like your eyes on me." Amy replied, wrapping her arm up over her shoulder to hold my head close to hers. "I love your eyes on me. Your hands on me. Your lips... uhnnnn... on me. Your tongue on me. Your cock on me. In me."</p>
<p>I pulled my hips away from her enough to slip my cock under her ass, moving forward again after so that it slid along her soft folds. She brought her knees up slightly higher and angled her ass back just enough for me to slide into her from behind.</p>
<p>"Oh yessss" She hissed as her hot pussy swallowed my entire length.</p>
<p>I rocked forward into her, sliding my free arm under her torso to be able to cup each of her tits in my hands. My lips planted kisses along her neck and jaw, while she moaned softly with each stroke.</p>
<p>"You feel so good, Amy." I crooned in her ear, "I love being inside you."</p>
<p>She smiled in reply, trying to mold her body against mine for maximum contact as we found our rhythm with each other. We made love to each other this time, unlike the urgent frenzy of fucking that had overtaken us earlier. Our hands explored each other more carefully, paying attention to how our bodies responded and learning each others favorite places to touch and be touched. We changed positions to me lying on my back while she straddled me. I loved watching her tits sway hypnotically above me while she rocked her hips back and forth over mine. She responded eagerly to my touch when my hands reached up to cup them. When her orgasm hit her, she arched her back away from me, thrusting her breasts harder into my palms. Her thighs quivered over mine, clenching me against her as tight as she could. She let out a long, shuddering gasp that sent me over the edge into my own climax, my cock releasing it's payload deep into her convulsing depths.</p>
<p>Amy collapsed contentedly against me. She reached up and grazed her fingers along my jaw.</p>
<p>"We are so good together." She sighed.</p>
<p>I was almost asleep when she slipped out of bed and padded down the hall to the bathroom. When she returned, she cleaned me with a washcloth that she dropped beside the bed and climbed back in with me. She spooned herself back against me, snuggling up as close as she could and I wrapped my arm around her. Her hand clutched mine between her breasts.</p>
<p>"Can we sleep this way?" I heard her whisper softly.</p>
<p>"Anytime you want." I replied, my eyes closed but my nostrils taking in the smell of her hair again.</p>
<p>"That means every night." Her hand gave mine a squeeze and she lifted it up to kiss it.</p>
<p>"Well... Anytime we can get away with it, at least." Our less than ideal circumstances popped back into my half-asleep mind. Amy didn't respond. My mind drifted off toward sleep when she brought me back from it one last time softly saying my name.</p>
<p>"Adam?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"No nightmares this time, okay?" Her body shook a tiny bit with her chuckle.</p>
<p>"No nightmares." I nuzzled her neck a moment and was asleep the next.</p>
<p>When I awoke the next morning, she was still fully nude and asleep in my arms. I stared, not moving, at the back of her head, the curve of her neck, the one exposed shoulder that was not under the bed sheets covering us. I found my mind wandering as I gazed at her. I thought about the little girl that I'd walked with down to the creek behind our home as a child and taught about the different types of animals that we'd see there. I thought about the little girl that would come home from elementary school with coloring books for me that she had bought at the book fairs with her own money because she thought I would like them. I thought about the girl, barely a teenager, who followed me to the skate park the first few times I went, thinking that I had not seen her trailing behind. I thought about how that teenage girl came running from her hiding spot when I misjudged a turn and launched myself into the air on a half pipe, knocking the wind out of myself when I landed on the bottom of the pipe. I thought about the cheerleader in high school who would go out and give it her all on the football field. I would watch her from the corner of my eye despite having no interest in the sport, whatsoever, content to drink whiskey John had stolen from his dad's liquor cabinet and secretly brought to the game instead. I thought of the beautiful young woman that the little girl from my memories had grown into. And I smiled because she now lying in my bed, sleeping peacefully next to me.</p>
<p>The Fall semester started at college and life became busy again for both of us. My classes were mostly in the fine arts building, while the majority of Amy's were in the business building on the far end of campus. It meant we wouldn't see each other as much on campus as we would have liked, but that was probably for the best if we had any hope of keeping up appearances. There were still a few hours here and there, those unfortunate gaps between classes that made the school day last longer, where one or the other of us had enough free time to make the journey across campus to see each other for a moment. Twice a week there was even an hour long gap that we both had free.</p>
<p>I was in Dr. Miller's art class again, but this time around Dr. Miller wasn't as confrontational with me. To be fair, I wasn't as stubborn of a student with him either. I guess I did have the potential to be a dick occasionally. He even invited me to participate in the Fall art show. My art history class was going to be a bit daunting, I decided, after seeing the size of the text book. Amy was excited about her classes, especially her finance class. How anyone could get that excited about math and economics was beyond my comprehension.</p>
<p>Amy became a common fixture in the art building those two days a week when we could meet up on campus. Because we both knew too many people on campus, we had to keep our relationship under wraps. It was not uncommon for guys to come up and try to flirt with her in my presence. She always let them down gently, giving them a story about a boyfriend off campus. I wasn't bothered by it at all anymore. It was even mildly amusing to watch, as I learned that guys are not as smooth as they generally think they are when they try to flirt with a woman.</p>
<p>Megan was around the art building, of course, and while Amy was never anything but polite, I picked up on the tiniest hint of irritation when Megan would visit with us. Of course, this could have to do with Meg's physical nature, as she often greeted me with a hug and would linger a perceptible second too long when she had occasion to touch me. Megan knew that I had a serious girlfriend now that was not attending the college and that none of our mutual friends had met. She once asked Amy if she had met my mysterious girlfriend, which made for a surreal conversation.</p>
<p>Amy mischievously described a fictional blonde girl named Marie, who was so loud in bed that Amy had once threatened to record us and put it on the internet so that she could finally get some sleep. I had smiled to myself at the name "Marie" as it was Amy's middle name. She then told the breakfast bite mark story, enjoying my embarrassment, changing the name of the suspected biter from Megan to that of my fictional girlfriend. That had made Megan give me quite a look, given that we used to sleep together and I had never caused her lose her self control to that level. Then again, I hadn't exactly tried. I only shrugged, somewhat bashfully at the look that Megan gave me. She had excused herself rather quickly after that conversation, to Amy's complete amusement.</p>
<p>At home, she continued to sneak into my room almost nightly once everyone had gone to bed. We did not dare have sex with our parents home as we both had no faith in her ability to keep quiet during intercourse, but we spent a lot of time keeping each other sexually satisfied in other ways. Our parents appeared to be still oblivious to our relationship, and we remained vigilant in keeping it that way. We found that our lives sort of fell into two halves, almost like two separate worlds.</p>
<p>There was the "outside world" where we had to interact with other people and maintain some kind of distance from each other and the "our world" that we fell into when we were alone. We tried our best to keep ourselves in that kind of a mindset, which made it easier to keep our forbidden relationship a secret. While we never exactly discussed the "rules" of the "outside world", we more or less understood them. We kept physical contact to a minimum. We purposely antagonized one another over petty things like we had done pretty much since birth. And we made a point of doing things separately with our friends. I still went out to the bar occasionally with John and the rest of the guys. She would go clubbing with her friends most weekends. Of course, this meant that we were usually the first ones to leave the bar or club so that we could get back home to each other.</p>
<p>Midway through the semester, the owners of the music store I worked for informed me that they were going out of business. It was not unexpected in the ever increasing digital era, but it was still disappointing. Finding myself temporarily unemployed, I was totally shocked when Dr. Miller offered me a position as his teaching assistant, which extended to helping him with things at his personal art studio. This was the kind of job offer that most of the art students on campus would kill for. I readily accepted the job, to Amy's complete delight.</p>
<p>One Friday afternoon, I came home from class and set about working on a new canvas for the upcoming Fall art show. Amy was going to a friend's after work and wouldn't be home until late. I spent about an hour on it before I heard my mother call for me from downstairs. I went downstairs wiping the paint from my hands on a heavily stained dishrag and found her in the kitchen, working on dinner.</p>
<p>"How was class?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Fine. I got my art history paper back today. I scored a 92 on it." I replied, quite relieved about that paper. Art History often bored the piss out of me.</p>
<p>"That's great, honey." She paused slicing up a bell pepper to look up at me. Something was clearly on her mind.</p>
<p>"Do you know if Amy has a boyfriend?" She asked me after a pregnant pause. I found myself cocking an eyebrow, curious where this was going.</p>
<p>"Not that she's mentioned. Why?" I tried not to sound as wary as I felt.</p>
<p>"It's just that she used to date all the time. I haven't heard her so much as mention a boy in a couple of months now. I'm not sure if I should be worried about her or not. Does she seem okay to you?"</p>
<p>"She seems fine to me, mom." I replied, dialing my hidden panic meter back down a couple of notches. This conversation wasn't headed where I initially feared it may be. "You remember that dickhe- er.. Sorry, mom. You remember that jerk she was seeing, Jeff? He cheated on her and really hurt her feelings. I think she's just taking a break for a little while from dating after that. But I think she's fine."</p>
<p>Thankfully, she elected to ignore my cursing. Normally, I'd have gotten a bit of a tongue lashing for that. It didn't matter how old I was, it was still her house. In her younger days, Amy had seen it as her personal mission in life to report me for every foul word that ever crossed my lips within earshot, despite her being the root cause of most of them.</p>
<p>"I guess so." Mom replied. "It's just not like her, you know? She should be out having the time of her life right now."</p>
<p>"I'm sure she's fine." I certainly hoped that she was having the time of her life, as well. Just not quite the way that our mother did.</p>
<p>"You'll keep an eye on her at school, right? Make sure she doesn't fall for the wrong guy?" She added.</p>
<p>"I can try, mom. She doesn't exactly value my opinion in the dating department." I felt the guilt stabbing me in the chest, feeling like my baby sister perhaps had fallen for exactly the wrong guy. The last guy she should ever fall for, in fact.</p>
<p>"I know, but you two are getting along really well these days.. Just try to watch out for her is all I ask."</p>
<p>"Sure. I'll do what I can." I replied, noncommittally. I felt bad about my relationship with Amy for the first time in a long while. It was one thing to not mention it to people and hide it. Directly lying about it to our mother was harder. Harder than I had expected.</p>
<p>"Thanks, sweetie. Dinner will be ready in about an hour. Love you."</p>
<p>"Love you too, mom." I replied and went back upstairs.</p>
<p>I didn't fully exhale until I retreated to the relative safety of my bedroom. While our mother clearly had no idea about us, that entire exchange rattled me. I went to my computer and turned the music back on. I paced back and forth in front of the canvas for a while, trying to shake the darkened mood that I was slipping into. My mother's words "the wrong guy" kept repeating in my head, feeling like I was very much the wrong guy, even if I was the only one who seemed to realize that. I paced more, feeling my chest tighten. My eyes bored holes in the black canvas in front of me. An image began to form in my mind... I grabbed the paint knife from my shelf and set to work.</p>
<p>I painted with an almost feverish intensity, working entirely in shades of black and white. I painted straight through dinner, never hearing the call that the food was ready. I kept layering on white paint, then scraping much of it away with the paint knife. Then I'd layer on black paint and scrap it the same way. Ghostly smears remaining behind. Subtle, mournful faces emerged from the background. Walls of tall, ominous shades of gray towered over them. Figures, not fully defined and only hinted at, cowered in the corners of the canvas, their faces covered in shame. The knot in my stomach finally began to loosen it's intense grip on me, as I wrapped up working on it for the night.</p>
<p>I backed away from the canvas a moment to take in what I had done so far. My now black and gray forearms ached from how hard I had been gripping the paint knife. The shorts I generally painted in, the ones with the yellow hand prints all over them, were now heavily flecked in black and white, like a wearable Jackson Pollock canvas. With a heavy sigh, I dropped to my knees in front of it and closed my eyes wearily. I sat on the floor that way for several long minutes, emotionally drained and exhausted.</p>
<p>A small, gentle hand came to rest on my shoulder. I almost flinched from it, but recognized the touch immediately and caught myself. I looked up at Amy's beautiful face to see a worried expression staring back at me.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, baby?"</p>
<p>Instead of replying, because I was unsure of what to say, I buried my face in her hip. For once, I remembered the paint all over my hands and didn't hug her. She placed a worried hand on the back of my head, holding me to her. She smelled so fucking wonderful to me, as always.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go take a shower, real quick. I'm a damned mess." I stood up and tossed the paint rag on the drop cloth by the rest of my art crap.</p>
<p>"I'll try to explain when I get out, okay?"</p>
<p>She nodded, still looking concerned, but not wanting to push the issue just yet.</p>
<p>I had been in the shower for a few minutes, collecting my thoughts and scrubbing my forearms clean. I was watching the paint from my arms create a gray line of water racing toward the drain, when the shower door opened and Amy, now fully naked, stepped in to join me.</p>
<p>"Are you nuts? What if one of them comes upstairs?" I gave her an alarmed look.</p>
<p>"They're asleep. They won't come up."</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"Already?" I replied, puzzled.</p>
<p>"What do you mean 'already'? It's after midnight." She still looked confused.</p>
<p>"Damn. I had no idea." I must have been working on that painting for hours.</p>
<p>"You were really intense with that painting. Something's really bothering you. I was in the room for about fifteen minutes before I touched you. You never even looked up." She took the washcloth from me, knelt down, and began scrubbing the paint flecks from my shins and calves. The sight of her gorgeous, wet, naked body kneeling before me caused my cock to take notice and twitch approvingly. "We don't have to talk about it now, if you don't want. I just felt like I should be here with you right now. If you want me here?"</p>
<p>She looked up at me questioningly. I cupped her cheek in my mostly clean hand, leaving a bit of a dark gray smudge on her face, and nodded. She flashed me one of the mid-sized smiles from her arsenal of things that she could use to melt my heart at any given moment.</p>
<p>"Mom is worried about you because you haven't been going out on dates lately." I cleared my throat.</p>
<p>"Oh really?" Her eyes sparkled in amusement.</p>
<p>"She asked me to watch out for you with the guys on campus."</p>
<p>"Hmm... So my big brother is going supposed to be the door man with the clipboard of names of who's approved to date me?" She asked playfully. Her hand came up to stroke my cock affectionately as she spoke.</p>
<p>"She wants me to make sure you don't fall for the wrong guy." I emphasized "the wrong guy" when I spoke, and swallowed hard. Her hand dropped from my cock to her thigh and she titled her head up at me. It was goddamned adorable. Why did she have to make this so difficult?</p>
<p>"So you are worried that you are 'the wrong guy'?" She asked.</p>
<p>"The worst guy." I replied, feeling that knot move its way into my throat. "The absolute worst guy you could ever fall for. Your brother. And isn't it part of my job to make sure that doesn't happen?"</p>
<p>She stood and wrapped her arms around me in a tight hug. Her naked form felt fantastic against me. My dick remained erect in defiance of my troubled emotions.</p>
<p>"You aren't the worst guy, baby. Not by a long shot. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. The absolute best. I'm so glad that I fell for you." Her hug tightened.</p>
<p>"You're biased." I made a tiny stab at humor, despite the circumstances.</p>
<p>"I am. But I'm also the most the most qualified to know what makes me happiest. YOU make me happy. It took me nineteen years to figure it out, but I did."</p>
<p>"I just want what's best for you, Amy. I love you more than anything." I whispered into her ear.</p>
<p>"That's easy. You are the best thing for me. You. So just keep loving me, and it will all work out, okay?"</p>
<p>"Okay." I nodded, and hugged her back. She tightened her hug even more, a desperately tight hug.</p>
<p>"Amy? I'd like to breathe now, if it's okay."</p>
<p>"Fuck you, jackass. I'll hug you as tight as I want." She slapped my arm playfully, but her eyes were rimmed in tears.</p>
<p>"You feel better now?" She asked, her voice totally serious.</p>
<p>"Much better." I kissed her forehead. She grabbed my face and pulled it down to hers in a deep, long kiss.</p>
<p>"Good. Glad that's settled. Now let's get this paint off before the hot water runs out."</p>
<p>I smiled at her, wiping the paint streak from her cheek, and did feel a bit better.</p>
<p>The Fall art show took place the weekend before Thanksgiving. Between prepping for the show, my class load, and work, I was insanely busy. The entire semester felt like it had gone by like a whirlwind. Amazingly, my classes were all going quite well. To no one's surprise, Amy's were going better. As it turned out, Dr. Miller gave me one of the most prominent placements in the show. I was one of five art majors who would have display space twice as large as the allocations that were given to the other students. The most noteworthy thing about this was that I was a sophomore. The other four art majors with the larger display space were all seniors and grad students. I heard rumblings of favoritism from some of the other art students, as I was Dr. Miller's assistant, but more than one student congratulated me. Amy was, of course, more excited than I was.</p>
<p>On top of how busy our schedules were kept between school and work, our parents had not gone on any of their weekend trips in over well over a month. As a result, Amy and I had been unable to even secure as much as an hour alone together in the house without a parent home in more than two weeks. As wonderful as her mouth and hands felt on my cock, I was absolutely dying to be inside her and she made her mutual feelings on the matter abundantly clear in a series of increasingly explicit text messages scattered through the passing days. There was also our upcoming Thanksgiving trip that would certainly keep us apart for a while.</p>
<p>The day before the show I had narrowed my choices down to ten paintings that I felt were decent enough to display. Amy asked to see the ones I chose and she agreed with most of my picks. I pulled two of them out that she seemed uncertain about.</p>
<p>"Why aren't you showing that one?" She pointed at the black and gray painting that I had placed midway through a pile of older paintings leaning against a far wall.</p>
<p>"I'm going to paint over it." I replied.</p>
<p>"What? Why? You worked really hard on that." She looked astonished.</p>
<p>"Bad memories. I only painted it to try to clear my head that night. It has too much meaning for me. I don't like looking at it." I admitted.</p>
<p>"I still think you should show it. I know you were really upset when you painted it, but it's a great painting. I bet it will sell."</p>
<p>"If it doesn't sell by the time we get back from Colorado, I'm burning the fucker." I muttered, more to myself than her. The following week, our family was going to visit our aunt, our mother's sister, and her family in Colorado. In the past, I had enjoyed snowboarding in the mountains. This year, I felt like trying to get out of going, but could not think of a good reason for Amy and I both to remain behind. Actually, I could. But I couldn't bring myself to tell our parents that I wanted to spend the week deep inside their precious daughter. I harbored a few concerns about being around family that had known us our whole lives that may see something that our parents had overlooked between Amy and I. I didn't know what exactly. Just something that may give us away.</p>
<p>I relented and put the painting in the show. Instead of naming it something arbitrary, as I usually did, I named it "Judgment." It turned out to be one of the first paintings in the show to sell. At least I was rid of the damned thing.</p>
<p>Our parents didn't come to this show, but Amy did. As before, seeing her in her outfit took my breath away. This time she wore a short, dark blue dress that showed a lot of leg. Her hair was again pulled back to show her sensuous neck, for my benefit, and her makeup was flawless. I wanted to take her home and fuck her the moment she walked in the door. I told her that very thing as soon as a safe opportunity presented itself. The death grip that she gave my arm, combined with the slight flush of her skin told me that my compliment, however obscene, had been well received. She moved among the people who would come to look at my paintings, playing up my artistic abilities and details of my work to them. Amy was far better with people than I was. I watched her with admiration as she seemed to effortlessly move from stranger to stranger, easing in and out of conversations.</p>
<p>As for myself, when Amy was chatting people up, I hung back near my work and visited with John, and for a brief while Dr. Miller. Dr. Miller commented again on my improvement as an artist, and to my annoyance, declared "Judgment" to be the best painting of mine he had seen thus far. But the majority of my time was spent with Amy, who intentionally kept me in a constant state of arousal throughout the event by shooting me seductive looks when no one was looking and occasionally whispering how badly she wanted my tongue or cock inside her when no one was in earshot. Needless to say, we left as soon as the show ended.</p>
<p>When I got home, my phoned vibrated with a text message from Amy telling me that our father was still awake and that she'd come to my room once everyone went to bed. Being the paranoid sort that I was, I promptly deleted the message and headed inside.</p>
<p>After a shower, I pulled on some cargo shorts and flopped in my office chair. I put on a jazzy electronic album and started a new sketch at the drafting table next to my desk. I liked to use calligraphy pens to draw when I worked on something larger than a sketchbook. Something about having to dip them in the ink reminded my of painting. I could see where it would annoy some people to have to stop every minute or so to reload their pen with ink, but I didn't mind. It felt like I had only started just begun to draw when I felt a hand snake down my chest and a head lightly rest on my shoulder. My face broke out in a smile as a familiar scent made its way into my lungs.</p>
<p>"Finally," I mumbled, dropping my pen on the table and spinning in my chair to face her.</p>
<p>Amy stood over me, wearing her blue kimono style bathrobe. Without an invitation, she dropped herself in my lap and wrapped her arms around my neck. I chuckled and kissed her.</p>
<p>"You don't have a shirt on." She smiled, pointing out the obvious. "That's not fair."</p>
<p>"Someone keeps stealing all mine. I'm running out of clothes." I no longer cared in the least if she wore my shirts.</p>
<p>"Well, you made all kinds of money tonight. You could go buy some more shirts with some of it." She replied as she looked down at my bare chest, dragging her fingertips over it.</p>
<p>"Or... you could just spend it all on me!" She smiled brightly at me.</p>
<p>"I dunno if you're worth it, really." I cut my eyes away from her, trying to contain my smirk.</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" She responded with the expected amount of indignation as she stood up. "I should just go back to my room tonight, if you feel that way about it."</p>
<p>She made a show of walking to the bedroom door, but spun back to face me, letting her kimono fall open as she turned.</p>
<p>"You sure you don't want to rethink that?" She asked. My eyes, operating on a will of their own, devoured the vision before them. Amy was wearing set of blue lingerie with black lace trim that I'd never seen before. She was so fucking beautiful that I had trouble remembering how to speak for a moment, and she knew she had me.</p>
<p>"My god..." That was as far as I got, before she shot me one a sultry look and began sashaying back toward me.</p>
<p>A new song started on the album that was playing. Amy clutched the robe closed and began dancing playfully to the music. I made a move to stand, but she gave me a stern look.</p>
<p>"Bad, brother, bad! Stay down." She snickered as she said it, but kept dancing. I took the hint, mildly amused, and sat back to take in whatever it was she was planning.</p>
<p>She swayed her hips as she danced, and allowed her robe to slip off of a shoulder. Her eyes would lock on mine, just long enough for the look in them to make my cock throb in excitement, then she'd look away closing them as she kept moving. A long, shapely leg would glide into view and then vanish behind the folds of the robe again as she danced. Whenever she would move close enough for it, I would reach for her, but she would slide away. There was laughter in her eyes when this would happen, but she kept her face serious and seductive. I kept my seat by sheer force of will alone as she continued to tease me.</p>
<p>She finally drifted just a little too close, and I managed to grab the edge of her robe. It was only after that I realized she had done that on purpose. She slid out of the robe in a single, graceful shrug and continued to dance around me in only her underwear. My beautiful little sister was completely mesmerizing. I snapped out of it as the song drew to a close and she twirled herself up next to me. This time I stood and wrapped her in my arms from behind. She sighed and leaned back into me, curling one arm over mine as I held her.</p>
<p>"Gotcha." I mumbled into her delicate throat as I began kissing it.</p>
<p>"Yes, you do." She sighed back, hugging my arm against her bra covered chest. Her other arm moved over my thigh, sliding back to pull me tighter against her.</p>
<p>One of my hands moved up to rest along the curve of her jaw, and she nuzzled her cheek into my palm in response. I kissed my way up to her ear, giving her lobe a quick nip before sliding my tongue along the crease behind it. She gasped softly and arched her back to push her head and shoulders against me harder. I cupped an undeniably inviting breast in my hand, feeling her nipple through the fabric of the bra and pinching it gently. Her body trembled and a shaky moan escaped her.</p>
<p>She reached back and unhooked her bra. I pulled her shoulders back toward me as she shrugged out of it, watching her glorious breasts come into view from over her shoulder. My hands skimmed the surface of her skin until they came to rest over the curves of her tits and began massaging them. Her head fell back against my shoulder with a long shuddering moan.</p>
<p>"God, I love you so much." I heard my sweet, baby sister whisper. Despite myself, a small smile broke out on my face as I continued kissing her throat.</p>
<p>"I love you, too."</p>
<p>Amy's hands snaked back between us as she fumbled for the buttons of my shorts. She let out a grunt of frustration after a few moments of groping around at my waist. Chuckling, I reached down and unbuttoned them, allowing them to slide to my ankles before getting back to groping her magnificent tits. She sighed, momentarily satisfied and ground her hips back against mine. I became aware that my erection was forcing her panties into the crack of her ass as we ground together.</p>
<p>Pulling her hair to the side, I began kissing the back of her neck and working my way down to her shoulders. I kept kissing her, watching the muscles of her back tense up as my lips played over them, gliding slowly and gently down. My fingers hooked into the sides of her panties and pulled them down as I settled on my knees. She moaned as my lips touched the small of her back. I brought my hands up to cup the globes of her beautiful ass, kneading them slightly. I could smell her arousal, her scent filling my lungs with anticipation. I unconsciously licked my lips.</p>
<p>Amy leaned over, supporting herself on the drafting table and parting her legs to allow me better access. I spread her ass cheeks and exhaled a breath of air across her softly parted folds. She gasped above me. I leaned in and kissed the back of her inner thigh, watching it twitch in response. I angled my face to the other thigh and gave it a light lick before pulling away.</p>
<p>"Mmm... you're a mean brother." She groaned in frustration. "Teasing me like that."</p>
<p>I smiled to myself behind her. I loved drawing out the last moments before I touched her. If that made me a mean brother, I'd learn to deal with it. I dropped one hand from her ass and caressed the inner thigh that I had kissed, bringing my hand up to the point of almost touching her already glistening pussy. I heard her suck in a breath and hold it, expecting my touch, and angled my hand at the last second so that my fingers never touched her pussy and brought my hand back down her thigh. The disappointed groan from above me was all I had hoped for.</p>
<p>"I'll remember this." She threatened.</p>
<p>"Says the one who started this." I replied, sending another warm breath across her lips. My hand moved back up to part her ass cheeks again, and I took in the sight of her beautiful pussy and the rosebud above it. It was just too inviting. My tongue licked down her slit, making her jolt as if I had zapped her with electricity.</p>
<p>"Oh yessssssssssss." She gasped, gripping the sides of the table, and lightly pressing her ass back toward me. My tongue parted her labia, drinking in the hot fluids that poured from her. I leaned forward, thrusting my tongue deeper into her. As I drew my tongue back, I impulsively did something I'd never done before with anyone. I ran my tongue along her puckered rosebud.</p>
<p>"WOAHSHIT!" She yelped and flinched away from me in shock.</p>
<p>"That was my asshole." She stared at me wide eyed.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I just saw it and suddenly wanted to taste all of you. Guess I shouldn't have?" I muttered, slightly embarrassed. She visibly relaxed.</p>
<p>"Don't be." She said, "I was just surprised is all. No one's ever done that to me before." She turned back toward the table, parted her legs even farther than before, and bent over as seductively as she could.</p>
<p>I ran my hands over her hips, leaned in and began planting kisses on her warm lips. I felt her clit with just the tip of my tongue, and she shuddered. My tongue made a lap around it twice, then ran back the full length of her slit. In moments, we were back to our rhythm and I could feel her desire radiating from her warm center.</p>
<p>"You.. uhnnn... can do it again." She groaned. "If you want." I kept my focus on licking her beautiful, aromatic pussy, thrusting my tongue as deep into her as it would reach, not wanting to break the mood again. It was a different experience going down on her from behind like this, her anatomy being positioned the opposite of what I was accustomed to when eating her out. After a few moments, she slightly bent her knees, lowering her ass the tiniest bit. Taking this as a sign she did wish for me to repeat my earlier action, I slid my tongue the full length of her pussy and kept going up to her tiny puckered hole.</p>
<p>She didn't flinch away this time. I watched it twitch slightly in response to my touch. My hands lightly gripped her hips as my tongue traced the perimeter of her asshole. She sighed and put a hand to her breast. I applied a little gentle pressure and felt my tongue penetrate her just the tiniest bit.</p>
<p>"Oooooohhh.." she hissed. "that feels.. different."</p>
<p>"Should I stop?" I asked, pulling away slightly and planting kisses across her beautiful ass.</p>
<p>"God, no. Do whatever you want to me." She gasped.</p>
<p>I brought my hand up to rub her slit, gliding a finger into her as my tongue bathed her rear entrance again. She moaned above me and began to quiver. I rubbed her clit lightly with one of my fingers as I pumped a second one inside her, my tongue prodding gently just above them. Amy's hips pushed back toward me, trying to get more of me into her. I complied, increasing my hand and tongue pressure until I was penetrating both of her holes.</p>
<p>"So close." She moaned.</p>
<p>I intensified my hand's efforts on her pussy, while my other hand roamed her back and hips. I kept tonguing her asshole, finally inserting it as far as I could and dragging it out slowly in a circular motion. Her orgasm hit her hard as she released a long series of muffled moans, and she bucked away from me, dropping to her knees. Only then did I notice she'd covered her mouth with one of her arms trying not to cry out. I sat back, watching her beautiful form gasp for breath as she came down from it. I couldn't help smiling softly. I loved and marveled that I could do this to her.</p>
<p>I went to wrap my arms around her, but she motioned me away. She had done this once before after a particularly strong orgasm, telling me later that it was just too much sensation at that moment. I knew better than to take offense and pulled myself, smiling, up into my office chair to let her recover. I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes. They opened again a few moments later when I felt her straddle me in the chair.</p>
<p>Amy's arms wrapped around my neck as she looked deep in my eyes, her throat and chest still flushed from the orgasm I'd given her.</p>
<p>"You, my dear brother, are fucking amazing." She whispered softly.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>"Funny, I was thinking the same thing about you." I replied. Without meaning to, I inhaled sharply as I felt my cock brush against her pussy. She grinned and ground her hips against mine, increasing our contact.</p>
<p>"I need my big brother's big dick inside me." She groaned in my ear. "The hell with our rules tonight. I need it."</p>
<p>As if she felt I needed convincing, she thrust her hips toward me, raising herself up at the same time so that her nipples grazed my chest. She knew the effect this had on me, and if she didn't, the feel of my cock's lurch against her mound should have left no doubt. I shifted my hips a bit when she rose up again, and felt the head slide between her wet lips.</p>
<p>"Ooohhhh yessss." She purred as my dick made its way into her tight canal. I released a groan of my own.</p>
<p>I dipped to take one of her breasts in my mouth, bathing her nipple with my tongue. She moaned almost too loudly and caught herself. Amy began rocking herself up and down, impaling herself on my cock. I closed my lips around her nipple and tugged gently, hearing her react with a whimper. Tilting my head back, I brought my hand up to cup the back of her head and draw her lips down to meet mine.</p>
<p>Our tongues sought each other out, hungrily darting around in each others mouths exploring every crevice. We both groaned into each other as I thrust up to into her.</p>
<p>"You are so goddamned gorgeous, Amy." I breathed, breaking contact with her mouth a moment. "I'm so lucky to have you."</p>
<p>"You'll always have me, sweetheart. I'm so yours." She whimpered in my ear, gasping softly, as her thrusts increased.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, her thrusts stopped momentarily, and she slid her hands back to rest on my knees, arching her back away from me. With her hands on my knees like that, her beautiful breasts were thrust upward toward me and I could see the lust filled expression on her face. She began moving up and down again, her chest heaving, breasts bouncing. The sight of my beautiful baby sister bouncing on my dick like that nearly made me come on the spot. I felt cemented in place, my attention focused on her amazing tits and beautiful face.</p>
<p>Amy brought a hand up to cup one of her breasts, pulling on her own nipple and moaning as she impaled herself on me over and over. It may have been the sexiest thing I had ever seen, and the sharp gasp of air I inhaled made her grin. She knew what she was doing to me.</p>
<p>"Fucking hell, you look sexy like that, baby." I breathed.</p>
<p>She brought her head up to meet my gaze, an intense, predatory look in her eyes. Her body rocked forward again to regain her balance. She gave me a hungry, lustful smile as she cupped the breast in her hand and brought it up to her lips. Her tongue snaked out over her nipple, her shimmering eyes closing momentarily as she moaned into her own nipple. My dick throbbed appreciatively, and she cocked an eyebrow, acknowledging that she felt it happen. She gave her nipple another lick and wrapped her lips around the little nub. A whimper escaped her as her lips held her nipple in place and her hand dropped away. My hand shot up to replace it, holding her breast for her and the corners of her mouth curled in a small smile. She released her nipple only to give me another hungry look.</p>
<p>My head shot forward, my tongue rocketing out to lick the underside of the same nipple she had licked. Our tongues wrestled with each other for a second around her nub, sharing the licking duty on her breast. Her eyes went wide at that, and I felt a warm rush of fluid against my crotch. She locked my mouth to hers, breast forgotten, in a bid to silence the scream threatening to break out of her throat. My hands dropped to her hips, pulling her onto my dick as hard and tight as I could. Blood was rushing in my ears as I felt the first surge of my semen burst forth deep into her. She let out a high pitched cry, her hot breath forcing its way into my lungs, as rope after rope of my semen splashed inside her. Her vagina held my dick like a vice, pulsing around it, her own orgasm rocking her body as strongly as my own. As she continuously shook against me, her hands gripped my shoulders with a fierce intensity. Finally, after what felt like a glorious eternity, our lips broke contact and she collapsed against me, her head on my shoulder.</p>
<p>I held her to me, breathing raggedly. As I regained my senses from the incredible release I had just had, I was struck once again by the realization that I'd never been with anyone who even compared to Amy. She was, without question, the most amazing lover I'd ever had. She was always telling me that I was full of surprises, but she seemed to blow my mind on a daily basis. She certainly had blown me away tonight.</p>
<p>Her breathing began to slow against me, and I began to wonder if she was awake. I resented that our parents were home. I really wanted to carry her to my bed and cradle her all night. I loved her more deeply than I had ever loved anyone. The risk of one of our parents coming upstairs to look for either one of us was kind of remote, but still a real possibility. One of her hands moved up behind me and she ran her fingers gently through my hair. I guess she was awake, after all.</p>
<p>"I really, really needed that." She whispered dreamily against my neck. I couldn't see her face, but I could feel from the way her lips brushed my skin that she was smiling. She kissed the side of my neck affectionately.</p>
<p>"Makes two of us." I replied. "You made me need it a hell of a lot more by the end, though."</p>
<p>"You liked my little show?" She asked, a playful tone in her voice.</p>
<p>"God, yes. It was incredible."</p>
<p>"After that move you pulled, I felt like trying something I'd never done before either. I'm glad you enjoyed it." Amy pulled away from my shoulder enough to meet my lips in a smiling kiss.</p>
<p>"Did you enjoy what I did?" I asked, just a little hesitant.</p>
<p>She blushed visibly at my question, and looked away at the floor.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I did. I enjoy everything you do to me." Her eyes shifted back to meet mine. I saw the emotion swirling in them. "I love you so much, Adam. I really do."</p>
<p>"I love you too." I responded, giving her a kiss of my own. We held each other a while longer, before she begrudgingly climbed off of me and went to the bathroom.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I was left sitting in my chair alone that I saw the India ink dripping from the drafting table. Somewhere along the way, we had knocked over the uncapped bottle of ink. So much for that drawing. I pulled my shorts on and set about cleaning it up. Thankfully, there hadn't been much on the drafting table to get ruined. I smiled to myself, thinking that a year ago, I would have wanted to kick Amy's ass for knocking over a bottle of India ink like that. At the moment, I felt like it was more than worth it.</p>
<p>Amy, wearing her robe again, got back in time to find me on my hands and knees scrubbing ink off of the floor.</p>
<p>"What hap- Oh!" She asked as realization sank in. "Sorry about that."</p>
<p>"No big deal."</p>
<p>She dropped down next to me and used the washcloth she had brought to clean up our other mess from the chair and the floor. Something about the two of us on our knees cleaning next to one another struck her as amusing and she gave me a playful shove. I ignored her just long enough to finish cleaning, then pinned her to the floor with my hand over her mouth while I tickled the living shit out of her with the other. She thrashed like wild, screaming into my hand but muffled enough to not wake the house. Once I could felt she was sufficiently harassed, I let her up.</p>
<p>"Meanie." She pouted.</p>
<p>"As if." I laughed. I reached over to where she was sitting on the floor and brushed the mess of her hair from her face to behind her ear. My hand slid down to cup her cheek and she nuzzled her face into it.</p>
<p>"I whine about it a lot, but it is torture that I have to go to bed alone every night while the love of my life is only 30 feet away." She sighed, her eyes still closed. "Especially after an amazing night like this."</p>
<p>"That must really suck. I can't imagine what that would be like." I quipped. Her eyes shot open and narrowed at me. She was right, but I had a sense of duty to be a wise ass. Reputation to uphold and all that.</p>
<p>"You jackass. I'm being serious."</p>
<p>"I could ask if mom will let us move your shit to the basement. It would give me a room to use for an art studio up here and add at least another 50 feet of distance for you."</p>
<p>She fought hard not to grin, but I could see the muscles on the side of her mouth twitching upward.</p>
<p>"Kiss my ass, damn it."</p>
<p>"Uhm... I kind of alrea-" I started.</p>
<p>"Oh, shut the fuck up!" She laughed, cutting me off at the same time, and turned crimson at the same time. "I set myself up for that one, I admit."</p>
<p>"By the way, I thought it was pretty funny the way you turned 'whoa, shit' into one word earlier." My grin widened.</p>
<p>"Damn it, you are in a mood, aren't you?" She scooted over against me where I sat with my back against the bed. "You always make me laugh."</p>
<p>"I try. I like your laugh."</p>
<p>"What am I gonna do with you?" She asked.</p>
<p>"I'm pretty sure you've done a lot more with me than any sister is supposed to do." I replied. "Not that I mind."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm pretty sure brothers aren't supposed to do most of what you do to me either." She pulled my arm around her in a snuggle.</p>
<p>"Want me to stop?" I teased.</p>
<p>"Not in the least. I never want you to stop."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>We hung out until we could barely keep our eyes open. Finally, I walked her to her room and tucked her into bed. She made a show of not letting me leave. She pouted when I made myself go to the door to leave.</p>
<p>"Adam." She called softly when my hand touched her door facing.</p>
<p>"What?" I glanced back at her.</p>
<p>She'd pulled the covers down and removed her top. She held one of her breasts in her hand and as soon as she saw me look back, she gave her nipple a long, sexy lick. Releasing it, my goddamned tease of a baby sister gave me a seductive wink. I stared at her hard for a moment, trying to will myself to head for the door.</p>
<p>"Still want to go?" She asked as innocently as she could.</p>
<p>"No, brat. I don't." I sighed, but I left anyway. I could hear her chuckle as I closed her bedroom door behind me. I was still smiling to myself when my face hit the pillow in my own room.</p>

<p>Part Four.</p>
<p>I hate waiting in airports. And I really hated them this particular morning. It was just after five in the morning and I was stuck sitting in an uncomfortable chair, sipping mediocre coffee and trying to wake up. I'd managed to sleep about an hour and a half the night before and was feeling it. Amy was sitting in the seat across from me, dozing off with her head leaning on our mother's shoulder. Our father was reading the paper, about as cheerfully as he ever appeared, while waiting for the boarding call. I wanted to be back home in bed, and I wanted Amy's head on my shoulder. But neither of those things were going to happen at the moment. I knew I was just being grumpy, having only slept a couple of hours the previous night, and occupied myself with trying to find a song on my phone worth listening to at this hour. Giving up, I stood up and paced to the large windows facing the tarmac. It was far too early for this, I thought to myself, as I polished off my coffee and went for a refill. The plane wouldn't be boarding for another hour and a half or so. Dad's impatience could be infuriating.</p>
<p>As I waited in the short line for my coffee, I felt a hand slip around my waist from behind. Startled, I spun around and stared in Amy's momentarily alarmed eyes.</p>
<p>"I just wanted a quick hug." She rocked back on her heel a half step. I cut my eyes back toward the waiting area and realized we were well out of the line of sight from our parents. She realized what I was doing and gave me a grin.</p>
<p>"I'm not stupid, you know. It's okay."</p>
<p>"Sorry, I'm not awake yet." I relaxed a little and gave her a hug. "I thought you were asleep."</p>
<p>"Just resting my eyes. I saw you head over here and wanted a hug. May not be much chance for that this week." Her smile was back.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm not looking forward to that part." I half grumbled as I paid for my coffee, then added. "Want anything?"</p>
<p>"Blueberry muffin?"</p>
<p>"You got it." I replied and paid the cashier.</p>
<p>"Thanks." She took the muffin and headed back to sit with our parents a few feet ahead of me.</p>
<p>Upon boarding the plane, I discovered that while my parents were seated toward the front of the cabin, my seat was mid-cabin and Amy's was toward the rear. Resigning myself to my fate, I sunk into my seat and hoped to at least get a nap in on the flight. A few minutes later, a tall, gray haired guy in a business suit tapped me on the shoulder. I glanced up at him.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, but there's a pretty young lady back there who informed me that she's terrified of flying and would feel much better if her brother was next to her."</p>
<p>I glanced back at Amy, who was currently giving me one of her better shit eating grins.</p>
<p>"Yeah, she can be a real basket case on an airplane." I nodded.</p>
<p>"I told her I would offer to swap seats with you so she could be more comfortable." The man smiled.</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir. I imagine your arm would thank you if it knew the size of the bruises she'd be putting on it when we take off, as well. She's got quite a grip." I stood and let him take my seat. He chuckled at that as I made my way back to sit next to Amy.</p>
<p>"That was clever." I muttered to her, buckling my seat belt. She rubbed my thigh affectionately and smiled.</p>
<p>"I have my moments." She replied. "You aren't the only devious one in the family."</p>
<p>"Me? Devious?" I feigned indignation. "I most certainly am not."</p>
<p>"Whatever, jackass." Her fingers interlocked with mine and we settled in for the flight.</p>
<p>Our Uncle Dennis and his son Brad were waiting for us at the airport. I greeted them both and then hung back while the rest of the family proceeded to hold a conversation with them at breakneck speed. We collected our luggage from baggage claim and loaded everything into my uncle's huge SUV. Within minutes of being in the car, I fell asleep with my head against a back window. Amy sat next to Brad on the seat in front of me, as we were purposely putting a little distance between us. It was going to be a long, long week.</p>
<p>It was a three hour drive to their cabin in the mountains. I slept for most of it. When I did finally wake up, not long before we arrived, I was feeling much better about the world. And in serious need of a bathroom.</p>
<p>Calling Aunt Linda and Uncle Dennis' place a cabin was a serious understatement. They were both very successful in the tech field and loaded. The cabin was a large, two story affair on a mountainside with a four car garage attached. They had an enclosed back deck with a fire pit, an indoor heated hot tub, and a huge living area. It was the family's favored place for gatherings and we'd come here almost every Thanksgiving for years.</p>
<p>As soon as we arrived, I excused myself to duck into the garage's bathroom for a much needed piss. I washed up and got back to the car just in time to grab the last of the luggage and follow everyone inside. Aunt Linda, our other cousin, Courtney, met us inside and the rapid fire conversation continued. Brad and Courtney were around the same age as Amy and I, both in college themselves. Within minutes, Courtney had Amy by the arm, dragging her off to her bedroom. Brad and I wandered down to the basement game room to shoot some pool.</p>
<p>"You guys got here first, so if you're smart, you'll lay claim to that sofa over there." Brad motioned to a large sofa in the corner of the room. "It's a lot more comfortable than the others and you sure as hell don't want the inflatable mattress."</p>
<p>"Yeah, no shit." I laughed. I'd been stuck with the inflatable mattress a couple of times over the years. The last time I had been left with it, I'd opted to sleep on the hard floor instead. At least the floor didn't squeak with my every move. I tossed my bags on the better of the sofas.</p>
<p>"So, while you were out cold in the car, Amy told me you had another art show last week. How did that go?" He asked, as he tossed me a pool cue.</p>
<p>"So far, so good. The show lasts another two weeks. I've sold four pieces so far, though."</p>
<p>"Damn, son. You're doing good with that, then?" He sounded impressed.</p>
<p>"It is what it is," I shrugged. "I'm doing okay with it, I guess."</p>
<p>"Amy made it sound a lot better than that. She said you had the primary placement in the show and that you have the department head as a mentor. She's proud of you, dude." Brad looked at me puzzled.</p>
<p>"My sister's got a big mouth." I mumbled. Less than a day into this trip and she's already talking about me more than I was comfortable with.</p>
<p>"How's school going for you?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Not bad, bro." He replied. "I'm getting nervous about next semester. Only two more to go. I have a few classes I've been putting off because I know they are gonna suck and it's now or never."</p>
<p>"I hear ya."</p>
<p>"I think I'm gonna ask Brenda to marry me." Brenda had been Brad's girlfriend for most of college. I couldn't say that I was surprised to hear this.</p>
<p>"That's awesome man. I'm sure she'll go for it."</p>
<p>"Man, I hope so. I really think she will, but there's always that nagging doubt, ya know?"</p>
<p>"Well, I've never proposed to anyone, but I know all about nagging doubt." I replied.</p>
<p>"Nagging doubt?" A female voice piped up behind us. We both turned to see Courtney and Amy walking up to us. Courtney continued. "About what?"</p>
<p>"I was just telling Adam that I'm thinking of proposing to Brenda." Brad piped up.</p>
<p>"Ah. That again?" Courtney replied. Then to Amy and I, she said "He's been going on about this for about six months now. I think he's too chickenshit to go through with it and he's trying to grow a pair."</p>
<p>"My ass. I'm just trying to find the right time, is all." Brad sounded defensive enough for me to suspect Courtney may be on to something and had to suppress a grin.</p>
<p>We all chatted and shot pool for about an hour or so as more relatives arrived. Eventually we headed upstairs for to join the rest of the family for dinner. The remainder of the night was pretty uneventful. Amy would be staying in Courtney's room tonight as Courtney had a queen sized bed and it was something of a tradition for them.</p>
<p>When it came time for everyone to go to bed, I went down to the game room and sacked out on the good couch. I couldn't get comfortable, of course, as it always took me a night or two to get used to sleeping away from home. I had just hit play on the latest Radiohead album when I got a text message from Amy.</p>
<p>"I don't get to say goodnight in person tonight. This sucks. Miss your arms around me. Love you, baby."</p>
<p>I smiled at the message. This was the first night since Rome that we hadn't at least kissed each other. Emphasis on the 'at least'. I responded back in kind and settled in for a long uncomfortable night. At least I would be able to give some of the albums I'd picked up lately a proper listen, I thought. Three albums later, I finally fell asleep.</p>
<p>The next morning, the family gathering chaos began in earnest as the remainder of the extended family that would be attending arrived. By the early afternoon, I was ready to dive out the window into the snow and walk to the airport on foot. After spending the appropriate amounts of time greeting everyone and doing the small talk thing, I retreated to the game room and sketched for a while at the couch that had become my refuge.</p>
<p>A short while later, Amy and our cousins turned up and we all shot pool for a while. I had a difficult time behaving as Amy would bend over the pool table to take a shot, and I was reasonably certain that she knew it as she tended to take shots from angles that pointed her ass toward me when she bent. I had to remind myself that despite the majesty of the ass in front of me, it would be unwise to give it the smacking it so desperately needed in front of our current company. When there was an opportune moment to check my phone, I fired off a text calling her a dirty tease. She looked pleased with herself when she next looked at her phone.</p>
<p>That night when everyone went to bed, she sent me another goodnight message. It was a mild solace to know I wasn't the only one feeling the effects of our current lack of privacy. Of course, then she made it worse by sending a follow up text expressing a desire to have my cock in her mouth. The even more explicit text that followed nearly gave me an erection hard enough be concerned about unintentionally pole vaulting off of the sofa should I roll over. Considering I was sleeping in a room with four other people, there was no way I was going to risk rubbing one out. I spent a good twenty minutes trying to talk my dick into settling down. She could be such a goddamned tease.</p>
<p>The following evening, the parents set up shop in the huge living room, while the kids played in the game room. The rest of us moved out to the back deck around the fire pit. A few of Brad and Courtney's friends came over and soon we had about a dozen people gathered around the fire pit, perched on various furniture. We were all chatting, drinking beer, and enjoying the fire. Well, the majority of them were chatting. I did a lot of listening, being my typical introverted self. A lot of listening and a whole lot of trying not to focus in on the way Amy's face was lit up by the light of the fire. Amy was seated next to Courtney across from me. Brad was seated next to me, but his attention was mostly on Brenda, who was sitting on his other side. Courtney's best friend, Kayla, wandered over and sat next to Courtney on the other side.</p>
<p>I used to have a thing for Kayla. One look at her and it was easy to understand why. She was a short, shapely, strawberry blonde with large breasts and big green eyes. She was also one of those affectionate types who always seemed to want to touch you when she talked. I had masturbated to her image a few times over the years, but never gotten the nerve up to do anything about my attraction to her because there never seemed much point. First and foremost, she'd never expressed much interest in me. We lived almost a thousand miles apart. And guys were lined up from half of Colorado to date her from what I gathered. But all of that was then. This year, I could not have been less interested in her.</p>
<p>Before long, the girls got going on the topic of relationships, of course. After about twenty minutes, the inevitable happened. I was half listening, mostly just watching the way the burning coals shimmered in the fire pit while sipping my beer, when Courtney looked over at me.</p>
<p>"So how about you, Adam?" She asked.</p>
<p>"What's that?" I asked, looking up at her.</p>
<p>"You seeing anyone back home?"</p>
<p>I shrugged noncommittally, resolutely not looking at Amy despite feeling her eyes on me.</p>
<p>"Or are you just patrolling the art department for random ass?" She clearly had a few drinks in her at this point.</p>
<p>"Nah. I've been keeping to myself for the most part." I replied, giving roughly the same answer I'd given the last couple of years.</p>
<p>"Really? I would have thought being a big shot in the art department would have art major freshmen girls throwing themselves at you." She laughed.</p>
<p>"Big shot? Hardly." I laughed.</p>
<p>"That's not what Amy told me." She replied, shrugging. "She said you had one of the most prestigious spots in the art show last week."</p>
<p>"He definitely did," Amy jumped in. She picked her phone up from her lap and started pulling up photos from the show. "Check out some of his paintings."</p>
<p>As Courtney and Kayla looked through the photos, I looked over at Amy in mild embarrassment. She just smiled sweetly at me. She always seemed so much more proud of me than I was of myself. It baffled me. But somewhere, deep inside, I loved her more for it. I wanted her to be proud of me.</p>
<p>"Some of these paintings are really nice." Kayla said, while Courtney and Amy nodded.</p>
<p>"Oh my god," Courtney suddenly exclaimed. "Look at this! Someone actually got Adam in a tie!"</p>
<p>"Let me see." Kayla exclaimed. Amy started giggling.</p>
<p>"Oh, hell." I muttered. "Gimme that." Courtney passed the phone to me as Amy tried to intercept.</p>
<p>"Don't you delete that!" Amy threatened, suddenly alarmed. "It's not every day my brother is something other than a t-shirt."</p>
<p>"I don't recall signing a photo release." I cocked an eyebrow at her and smirked as I looked at the photo. I had never seen her take it. I was leaning against a column at the art gallery, in a dress shirt and tie, looking off to the side toward one of my paintings, a beer bottle absently hanging from one hand. As photos went, it was one of the better ones of me.</p>
<p>"I mean it, Adam. I will kick your ass if you delete that." Amy threatened again. There was a hint of actual malice in her voice.</p>
<p>Amy remained clearly on edge until the phone was passed back to Courtney. She knew very well how much I despised being in photos. I didn't delete the picture, though, and I remained slightly amused by her threats.</p>
<p>"So you really have paintings hanging up in an art gallery, and you're telling me the sensitive artist angle isn't helping you reel in chicks left and right?" Courtney asked mischievously.</p>
<p>I shrugged. "I do alright, I guess."</p>
<p>"Don't buy his attempt at being all mysterious." Amy chimed in, clearly relieved that her phone was no longer in my possession. "He's been out plenty."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?" Courtney glanced over at me. "He's holding out on us?"</p>
<p>"I'll say," Amy laughed. "He came down to breakfast one morning looking like he'd been mauled. Mom called him on it. It was pretty hilarious. He had this bite mark on his neck so deep you could count the teeth."</p>
<p>I buried my face in my hand. She enjoyed getting mileage out of that story. The little brat.</p>
<p>"Damn, Adam. I'm impressed." Kayla let out a low whistle. "You must have done something right to have a girl deliver that kinda damage."</p>
<p>There were a few laughs, while I hung my head. I glanced at Amy, who was grinning mischievously. I decided to just go with it.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I got a whole speech about using protection out of that one. Meanwhile, this brat sat there laughing at my ass." I pointed at Amy, while chuckling a little. Mostly I was chuckling at the memory of the relief I'd felt when our mother hadn't clued in on the true origins of the teeth marks.</p>
<p>Courtney, Kayla, and Brad all laughed their asses off at that. Amy grinned ear to ear, and only when everyone was looking at me did she give me a very sexy smirk, for only a moment. I suspected she was remembering that night with the same fondness that I did.</p>
<p>"I gotta say, cuz." Courtney laughed. "I think I'd have an ego problem if I were you. Not be all humble about it."</p>
<p>I just shrugged in response and left it at that, taking a long swig from my beer. I noticed Kayla's eyes linger on me a bit longer than the rest of them.</p>
<p>Much to my relief, the conversation soon steered back to one of Courtney's disastrous dates. We all laughed about the train wreck of a guy that one of her friends had insisted would be perfect for her. At some point during the talk, Kayla excused herself to get another beer and when she returned, she sat down next to me. Kayla grabbed one of my sketchbooks that had been sitting on top of the bag in front of me.</p>
<p>"Can I look at this?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Sure. Go ahead," I shrugged. She settled in and started flipping through the sketchbook. I noticed Amy stiffen up the tiniest bit at Kayla's move to sit next to me and wondered if she had been aware of my crush on Kayla in previous years. She probably had. Women seemed to be pretty perceptive about these things.</p>
<p>I turned to Brad, purposely avoiding much conversation with Kayla for the moment and asked if he was interested in going snowboarding the following morning.</p>
<p>"Yeah, man. Sounds like fun." He replied, then added. "Probably the only chance we'll get while you're here this time around, too. You're leaving on Saturday, right?"</p>
<p>"Flight leaves Saturday afternoon." I nodded. Brad was right. It was Tuesday night, the following day was the day before Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving day we'd be tied up with family stuff and most of the family would be on a shopping trip on Friday. This was probably the only chance we'd get to snowboard, if we were going to.</p>
<p>I finished the last of my beer and stood to get another. I saw that Amy's was empty and pointed to it, raising my eyebrows questioningly at her. She nodded, indicating she'd like another. I fetched two bottles and passed one to her when I returned. I noticed Courtney looking at me with mild curiosity out of the corner of my eye.</p>
<p>"Here ya go. There's some neat stuff in here." Kayla said, returning my sketchbook to me when I sat back down with my beer.</p>
<p>"Thanks." I mumbled, as I put the book back in my art bag. She took another swig from her beer and dried the moisture from the bottle on her pants leg.</p>
<p>"Is that the only one you have with you?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Here ya go." I pulled another sketchbook from my bag and passed it to her.</p>
<p>Kayla leaned against me, curling her legs up to the side and beneath her as she looked through the sketchbook. My right arm was pinned against me rather awkwardly. I glanced up to see Courtney looking at Kayla with a small grin of amusement. Amy was resolutely staring down at her phone, trying to hide her irritation. Her fingers gripped her phone so tightly, that I could see that her knuckles were white from where I was sitting.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>I stood up and made an excuse about going to the restroom. It was the best I could come up with at the moment. Kayla, looking a little uncertain, shifted to a more upright position on the bench as I passed by her. I could swear I heard Courtney chuckling as I left the room, but I wasn't certain that it was about what had just transpired. Fuck it. Let them think I'm just being shy and awkward. Whatever got me out of that situation.</p>
<p>I made my way to the bathroom and debated my options while I washed my hands for no other reason than to buy time. I went down to the basement and grabbed my coat from on top of my luggage and went out through the garage for a walk. It was pretty damned cold out, but better than staying in there.</p>
<p>I went a few hundred yards listening to my headphones when my phone chirped at me with a text from Amy.</p>
<p>"Where are you?"</p>
<p>"I went for a walk."</p>
<p>"Are you okay?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. I just didn't want to make a scene in there. Figured it was better if I just removed myself."</p>
<p>"She was pissing me off."</p>
<p>"I saw that. Couldn't think of a way to tell her I wasn't interested without making it weird for everyone. Sorry."</p>
<p>"You used to be interested. Not anymore?" Well, that answered that question.</p>
<p>"Not at all. You know me better than that." I sent back, pondering how the hell I got into this situation.</p>
<p>"Can't blame a girl for wanting a little reassurance, right? I mean, if we were around strangers, I could have claimed my territory." I actually chuckled a little at her reply. She had a point, but her wording amused me.</p>
<p>"Territory? I'm part of a turf war now?"</p>
<p>"Shut up, jackass. You know what I mean."</p>
<p>"When we get home, I'll give you all the reassurance in the world, beautiful."</p>
<p>"Mmm... I'm gonna hold you to that."</p>
<p>Feeling a little more confident that I'd navigated the minefield for now, I slid the phone back in my pocket and tried to warm my hands in my coat pockets. I walked for another quarter mile or so, then made the trek back to the house. Instead of going back to hang out around the fire pit, I went to the basement and curled up on the sofa, listening to some music. I'm not sure when I dozed off.</p>
<p>I felt a pair of soft lips touch mine. At first, my mind thought it was a dream about Amy, except the lips didn't feel like hers. But dreams are like that, I thought. Things are always a little off. Except I tasted mango lip gloss. I don't remember ever tasting anything in a dream. Do dreams allow you to taste flavors? I thought about that for a moment, then realized that I couldn't be dreaming because I was laying at an uncomfortable angle. I was laying at an uncomfortable angle in a dark basement on a sofa, with lips that tasted like mango lip gloss on mine. I opened my eyes just as the lips moved from my own and Kayla's face came into view.</p>
<p>"Wha..?" I started, a little too loudly.</p>
<p>"Shhh" She interrupted as quietly as possible, holding two fingers to my lips.</p>
<p>The fuck? My brain lurched into full motion again, the fog of sleep gone. I realized my whole debate about taste had taken only a second. That weird way that your subconscious mind bends the concept of time when you are not awake. Why the hell was she kissing me?</p>
<p>"Follow me." She whispered almost imperceptibly, smiling as she beckoned me to follow her with her hand.</p>
<p>I looked around the room and saw the other cousins sleeping on various furniture around the basement. Right at that moment, the air mattress across the room squeaked as my second cousin, James, rolled over. The poor bastard must have drawn the short straw on bed assignments.</p>
<p>I didn't want to follow her, but I didn't want to wake everyone up when I ended this nonsense. Jesus, this chick couldn't take a fucking hint. Part of me couldn't believe I was this annoyed, considering how much I wanted to be with her on previous trips here. But now, she was complicating my already complicated life and I didn't want that at all. This was one of those times when I was certain that if there was a deity above, they definitely had a sick sense of humor and considered me to be a favorite toy. I rolled off of the sofa and walked behind her, not bothering to pull my shoes on.</p>
<p>She led me back to the deck, although no one was in the room anymore and the fire pit was all but extinguished.</p>
<p>"You didn't come back earlier, so I thought I'd come down and find you." She smiled as she went to put an arm around my neck. I back peddled and she paused in reaction, giving me a perplexed look.</p>
<p>"What is this?" I asked, staying out of her reach.</p>
<p>"I'm just trying to get closer to you. You've always acted like you wanted me to." She replied, trying to sound as sweet as she could.</p>
<p>"Why now? You barely gave me the time of day before." I cocked an eyebrow. No way was I going to get into something with her, but I was still curious why the sudden interest. I suspected I didn't have all the pieces to this particular puzzle.</p>
<p>"I don't know. You looked cute earlier. I liked your drawings. I thought you wanted me." She suddenly looked shy and uncertain. She was playing up the cute angle with me, but I was immune to her charms.</p>
<p>"If this had been last year, you would have had me around your finger, Kayla. And I really don't want to hurt your feelings. But I'm seeing someone back home. This can't happen. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"Well, that's back home, right? You're still here for a few days. We can have a lot of fun in with a few days." She grinned, stepping forward to put a hand on my chest and tried to move closer to me.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Kayla. That's not me. I'm can't do that to someone I care about." I backed away again, not smiling.</p>
<p>"Okay, if that what you really want. It's your loss." She shrugged. I saw the bitter look in her eyes. It was obvious that she wasn't used to rejection.</p>
<p>"Look, it's not your fault. You're a very beautiful girl. If I were single, this would be a very different conversation. I'm sorry." I continued to work my way back toward the door. She stayed were she was this time, looking at my chest, not meeting my eyes. I hoped that I hadn't hurt her feelings, although I was more than a little annoyed that she thought I was the kind to cheat on someone. That wasn't in my nature, and sure as hell wasn't in my nature when it came to Amy.</p>
<p>I made my way back down to the basement and sat in the far corner of the sofa. I wiped my mouth a few times with my thumb. I'd always hated the taste of mango, and this was no exception. Christ, I was ready for this trip to be over. I didn't sleep much that night, too unnerved by the events that evening.</p>
<p>The next day was spent snowboarding with Brad. After spending the early part of the morning locked in heavy debate with myself, I decided to come clean with Amy about the incident from the night before. I sent her a long text message while Brad drove us to the park, explaining the course of events. Amy was wicked pissed at Kayla's boldness, but seemed to have calmed down after a while and thanked me for telling her what had transpired. I reassured her that she had nothing to worry about and hoped that it would be the end of it.</p>
<p>In the evening, worn out from a long day spent snowboarding on zero sleep, I sat in front of the fire pit and stretched.</p>
<p>"It's cold out here." Amy said as she flopped down next to me with a throw blanket. She spread the blanket across both of us and snuggled up next to me in a mostly innocent manner. For appearances sake, I kept my arms above the blanket. One of her hands rested lightly on my thigh under the blanket, hidden by my arm. She gripped my thigh tightly for a moment and whispered. "I still want to hurt the bitch, but thanks for not trying to hide it from me."</p>
<p>"This week needs to be over, I've had enough of this shit." I muttered quietly, hearing footsteps approaching.</p>
<p>"Mmhmm." She nodded in agreement as Courtney flopped down on the bench across from us.</p>
<p>"You look tired, Adam." Courtney smiled.</p>
<p>"It was worth it. Even if I wound up with my face in the snow more than usual." I chuckled. "But yeah, I wore myself out."</p>
<p>"Gotta be better than asphalt." said Amy. "I remember seeing you land face first on that more than once."</p>
<p>"Definitely better than asphalt." I agreed.</p>
<p>Brad and Brenda turned up with a few extra beers to pass around to those of us who were empty.</p>
<p>Brad looked over at me and commented "My ass is kicked, dude."</p>
<p>"Yep. Same here." I nodded.</p>
<p>Brad and I compared notes on our various snowboarding mishaps from earlier in the day. At some point, a short while later, Amy laid her head on my shoulder and fell asleep. I was amused at her move to stay close to me, while not being overt and arouse suspicion. As least that was what I thought she was up to until I heard her softly begin to snore. Brad left to drive Brenda home, leaving me with Courtney and a sleeping sister.</p>
<p>"Looks like you're trapped." Courtney said to me with a grin, nodding toward Amy.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I was just noticing that." I replied, cutting my eyes down at my sleeping sister.</p>
<p>"You really pissed Kayla off last night, from what I hear." Courtney said with a grin.</p>
<p>"Really? I was trying not to hurt her feelings." I sighed.</p>
<p>"You're fine. She just isn't used to rejection. I love her to death, but I have to admit it's pretty funny to see her trying to figure out how to deal with someone actually telling her no." She chuckled.</p>
<p>"Hmm?" Amy stirred and wrinkled her nose adorably.</p>
<p>"I was just telling your brother how Kayla was pretty mad that he shot her down last night." Courtney replied.</p>
<p>"Good for her." She mumbled, cracking open one eye.</p>
<p>"She's just pissed? I didn't hurt her feelings?" I asked, only mildly concerned.</p>
<p>"She's fine. Don't sweat it. She needed to come down a peg or two anyway. You probably did her a favor." Courtney chuckled.</p>
<p>Amy grumbled something unintelligible and closed her eyes again. I thought I made out the word "whore" in there somewhere, but I didn't want to ask for clarification.</p>
<p>A couple of minutes later I heard Amy start snoring softly again.</p>
<p>I looked over at Amy and shifted my shoulder. "Wake up, brat. Time for bed."</p>
<p>"What?" she groaned.</p>
<p>"I said time to get up and go to bed."</p>
<p>"Don't wanna." She mumbled.</p>
<p>"Courtney, go grab me a handful of snow, would ya?" I asked. Courtney started snickering.</p>
<p>"Nooooo." Amy cried softly and draped an arm across me. I moved her arm back to her side and shrugged a little more forcefully.</p>
<p>"Last chance, kid. Snow's coming." I warned.</p>
<p>"But I'm tired." She whined, dragging the last word out. She cracked open one eye and stared up at me pouting. "Carry me?"</p>
<p>"Carry you? What are you, a five year old?" I laughed. Had we been at home, I would have done it in a heartbeat. "Not happening, brat. Get your ass up and go to bed."</p>
<p>"Fine." She stuck her tongue out at me as she shuffled out of the room with the blanket hanging off of her shoulders.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving morning, I woke up early and hit the shower. I dried off and got dressed. I unlocked the bathroom door and the door handle turned in my hand, startling the hell out of me. I stepped back from the door, expecting it to fly open in my face. Instead, it opened slowly about a third of the way, and Amy slid into the bathroom looking over her shoulder as she did. She closed the door and locked it again, then spun and nearly ran into my arms. I can't say I wasn't relieved that it wasn't Kayla.</p>
<p>I broke our embrace with one arm just enough to turn on the water in the sink.</p>
<p>"You're out of your mind." I whispered to her, hoping the water would mask our voices to anyone who may pass in the hall. With at least a dozen people in the house who knew us, this felt like an incredible risk.</p>
<p>"I know. I just wanted a few seconds alone." She replied, planting her lips on my neck. I didn't notice until that moment that she was holding her travel kit with her. To anyone who wasn't standing right at the door, she was simply going to the bathroom as soon as I left. The overlap would only be apparent to someone who saw her enter or me leave. She could be a clever little shit, when she wanted.</p>
<p>I gave her a deep, lingering kiss, allowing one of my hands to cup her ass for emphasis. She melted into me immediately, a soft moan escaping her lips.</p>
<p>"I gotta go, baby." I whispered, letting my reluctance to leave her side show in my voice. She nodded, smiling.</p>
<p>"I just needed a quick kiss." Her eyes skipped down to the tent in my pants. "And to remind myself that I could do that to you."</p>
<p>I walked to the door, turned and walked right back up to her. I gave her another passionate kiss, this time groping her tits a moment before sliding my hand into her pajama pants and running my fingers over her slit, allowing the middle one to part her slightly. She melted again, groaning into the kiss. I pulled my hand away and slid my finger into my mouth, tasting her. She took a sharp breath and leaned up to kiss me again, but I slipped away to the door.</p>
<p>"Where do you think you're going?" She pouted.</p>
<p>"I gotta go," I repeated with an evil grin. "I just wanted to remind myself that I could do that to you."</p>
<p>"Goddamned tease." She replied, but she was smirking. She looked a little shaky as she leaned against the counter.</p>
<p>I laughed quietly and slipped from the room. I made it about five feet down the hall before I turned back toward the door. I heard the lock click into place.</p>
<p>"Damn it," I mumbled. I could have knocked, but I knew it was best I didn't. We'd already pushed our luck enough for one morning. I sighed and went to find breakfast.</p>
<p>The rest of Thanksgiving day went mostly without incident. Thankfully, Kayla had gone home the night before to spend the day with her own family. Amy and I felt continually trapped by our circumstances after that incident in the bathroom. We maintained a careful distance from each other, very much against our desires. We still stole glances at each other periodically throughout the day, both of us wanting this week to be over. Eventually, she got roped into helping out in the kitchen by Courtney while I shot pool in the game room with Brad.</p>
<p>When everyone sat down for dinner, Amy sat across from me. She made sure that she dipped over several times while passing serving dishes around, allowing me plenty of opportunities to see down her blouse. It wasn't long into the meal before I felt a bare foot sliding up between my legs. I shot her a dirty look, but kept my composure. She was absently listening to our mother chattering away with Aunt Linda, chewing happily on a piece of turkey, while her toes rubbed my cock to an erection under the table. I casually dropped my hand below the table and pushed her foot away.</p>
<p>The amount of food on the table was daunting. All of it looked absolutely incredible. I had overdosed on seasoned potatoes with turkey gravy, and was currently working my way through a pile of steamed broccoli, when I saw the mischievous smirk cross my baby sister's face. Uh oh, I thought. Conversations from the family surrounding us was just as abundant as the food. Maybe five minutes passed, and the foot returned, rubbing itself along my cock.</p>
<p>I reached for my phone and fired off a text message. "Cut the shit, damn it."</p>
<p>Understandably, for appearances sake, she waited a minute or two to reach for her phone. I had long since slid mine back in my pocket. Her lips curled upward in a grin when she saw the text, and I felt her toes make another determined stroke across the length of my dick. Really? I thought. The little brat was asking for it.</p>
<p>I picked up my dining knife, glancing about to make sure no one had their eyes on me, and dropped my hands below the table. She cocked an eyebrow at me, unsure what I was planning to do. Grabbing her foot before she had a chance to retreat, I spun the blade around backwards. I drug the back of the knife very lightly and slowly down the arch of her foot, tickling her foot in the process. Amy suddenly coughed and straightened, making a show of having swallowed something wrong to mask how hard she was fighting off laughter. She struggled to pull her foot away, while straining to not be obvious about it. Considering my point made, I released her foot, which retreated rapidly back to where it belonged. I pretended to show concern that she'd not hurt herself with her choking act and then settled back into enjoying my meal.</p>
<p>She stuck her lower lip out in an adorable little pout for a tiny moment, which made me chuckle to myself. Her foot ventured back to my turf under the table, but she confined it to rubbing my lower leg affectionately. This was acceptable to me as it was substantially less risky. I kept my dining knife resting on my thigh in case I needed it again.</p>
<p>She wisely kept her damned foot to herself for the remainder of the meal. That didn't keep her from going out of her way to be as cute as possible and giving me seductive looks every chance she got. At one point, I thought I saw Brenda giving Amy a strange look and then glancing at me, but she said nothing. That kept me slightly nervous for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>We didn't see one another much at all on Friday, as she took off with most of the family on a shopping trip while I remained behind on babysitting duty. This was my curse every year. I didn't want to do much shopping, because I hated crowds, so I would stay behind with the younger kids who didn't want to wait around in long lines all day. Kayla had returned to join Courtney for the shopping trip. She shot daggers at me with her eyes whenever I happened to be in the same room with her for a bit, but I did my best to ignore them.</p>
<p>Early Saturday morning, we loaded everything back in the SUV, said our goodbyes to everyone, and Uncle Dennis drove us back down to the airport. About fifteen minutes into the drive, Amy laid down across the backseat and rode with her head in my lap. She made a show of saying how tired she was, but we both knew it was just because she wanted to be close to me. After making sure my hand and her face were sufficiently out of sight of our parents, I spent most of the drive with my hand on her cheek or gently stroking her hair affectionately. She reveled in my loving touch. She tapped my wrist lightly at one point, and when I looked down at her, her mouth formed the words "I love you" soundlessly. I smiled down at her warmly and looked back out at the passing snow.</p>
<p>We were almost done with this trip. In some ways it felt much longer than the two weeks she had spent in Rome. Probably because I could see her the entire time and she was just out of my reach, so to speak. I had to admit gaining a little satisfaction from knowing that her week had been spent in a similar hell.</p>
<p>Finally home. I dropped my bags on the bed, fired up my laptop and selected an early Aphex Twin album to listen to while I unpacked. My bedroom door was open and I saw my sister walk by on her way to her bedroom. She gave me a quick, tired smile as she passed. The flight had been delayed, cramped, and uncomfortable. There wasn't anyone willing to switch seats this time either. We were all tired and cranky by the time we got home. I finished unpacking my stuff and flopped down on the bed with my laptop, intending to check my emails and screw around on the internet for a few minutes. I fell asleep in no time.</p>
<p>It was dark outside when I woke up. I glanced at the clock and saw it was just after eleven. Christ, I'd been asleep for hours. I guess a week spent trying to sleep on an unfamiliar sofa listening to distant relatives snoring around the room will do that to you. Stretching, I caught a whiff of myself and realized I was in need of a shower.</p>
<p>The house was quiet. I guess no one was awake. I padded down the hall to the bathroom, noticing Amy's door was closed and there was no light under it. She wouldn't mind me going in and waking her up, but I was a little self conscious of my body odor. It had been hot in the plane while take off was delayed. I guess my deodorant had lost the war.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>I'd been in the shower all of five minutes before I heard the bathroom door click open. I peaked over the top of the shower just in time to see Amy slip out of her bathrobe and drop it on the laundry hamper. She joined me under the water's spray a moment later.</p>
<p>"Mmm..." She sighed happily, as I wrapped my arms around her. "I've missed you holding me."</p>
<p>My cock was already erect and pressing against her stomach. My hands slid down and cupped the globes of her wonderful ass.</p>
<p>"You certainly were a terror this week." I mumbled.</p>
<p>"I can't help it that I want you all the time." She smiled up at me, as she started stroking my cock. "And it didn't help that Courtney kept wanting to talk about sex every night."</p>
<p>"She did?" I asked, groaning slightly as Amy dropped to her knees and began licking my hardened shaft.</p>
<p>"Constantly." She purred as she ran her tongue around the head of my penis.</p>
<p>I didn't reply as I was totally lost in the sensation of her mouth engulfing my cock. She pulled me into her and then withdrew, dragging her tongue along the bottom of my shaft. One hand cupped my balls while the other was drifting down between her legs.</p>
<p>"I love your cock," she gasped, before taking me back in. I leaned against the shower wall, one hand resting on the back of her head as she bobbed up and down my length. Fucking hell, she was good at this. It seemed like every time she did it, she improved her technique.</p>
<p>"It's pretty fond of yo-" I tried to quip, silenced by the sensation of my penis gliding into her throat as she took me in completely. The feel of her throat twitching to try to accommodate me nearly sent me into spasms before she withdrew, gasping heavily. She worked my dick with both hands, twisting them slightly as she glided them up and down my shaft. Amy coughed a little, trying to recoup from swallowing my cock.</p>
<p>She looked up at me, while she caught her breath. Water droplets splashing from my shoulders struck her face lightly making her blink every second or two. I found myself completely taken by the vision of her on her knees in front of my erection, naked and dripping wet.</p>
<p>"You are so sexy, I swear." I breathed. Her expectant look broke into a shy smile and she blushed a little. It was goddamned adorable.</p>
<p>"Am I really?" She asked as I nodded. "So are you."</p>
<p>I took her hands and pulled her to her feet. Our lips met and opened, our tongues seeking each other out and massaging each other. One of my hands made it to her ass again and squeezed appreciatively.</p>
<p>She quickly spun around to face away from me, pulling my arms up around her chest. Her hips rocked back to position my hard penis up along the crack of her ass and pressed against me. I groaned as she slid her ass up and down along my dick, wedging it between her cheeks. She let out a moan, grinding her ass crack against me.</p>
<p>"Put me up against the wall and do me from behind before we run out of hot water. I'm dying to feel you inside me." She growled.</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am." I replied, amused by her sudden assertiveness.</p>
<p>I moved up behind her against the wall as she parted her legs to make room for me. I reached down with one hand and grabbed my shaft, moving the head of my dick between her legs. It slid along her lips a few times, before I positioned it at her entrance. I moved forward a slight amount, the head penetrating her tight folds.</p>
<p>"Oh fuck," she hissed. "Yes! Put it in me."</p>
<p>I moved forward, sliding into her as far as I could, letting out a groan as her hot sex took me in. She was more than ready for me, and I moved through her wet vagina with long, smooth strokes. Emphasizing her request to be pinned against the wall, I put more of my weight against her back, smashing her breasts into the wall. Her arms were extended out to the side, palms flat on the shower wall. Her head turned to the side, eyes closed in ecstasy, as she moaned erotically with each thrust.</p>
<p>"That's it, baby." She moaned. "Fuck your baby sister! Take her. Make her yours!"</p>
<p>"Damn, you're in a mood, aren't you?" I whispered hoarsely with a smirk, as I gripped one of her hips in my hand and used it as leverage to thrust into her harder. Her mouth crept up into a grin by way of reply, as groans continued to be forced out of her body by my thrusts. She pushed herself away from the wall, bending over slightly to allow me to penetrate her deeper.</p>
<p>Her moans grew louder, and I shot my hand up to cover her mouth as I thrust. Amy took the hint and closed her mouth, making strained mewling noises instead. My hands glided back down her sensuous wet back, following the contours of her body. I ran my hands back up her body to cup and massage her breasts. She groaned in response, and started whimpering as I pulled her nipples gently.</p>
<p>"Are you close?" She panted.</p>
<p>"Getting there."</p>
<p>"Will you come on me?" Her voice was a hoarse whisper, struggling to get out the words between her groans of pleasure as I rocked in and out of her like a piston. "I want to feel you all over me."</p>
<p>"Yes." I replied, as it was the only thing I could manage to say, as her words made my head swim and my dick lurch. She was feeling seriously dirty tonight, I thought.</p>
<p>"You're gonna come... uhnnn... come all over..." She was panting again, her breath coming in quickening gasps. "your little princess? Paint her with... uhnn... your hard... cock?"</p>
<p>Before I could even reply, her whole body shook with the force of her orgasm. She buried her mouth against a forearm trying to stay quiet, releasing a muffled scream, as she supported herself with her other arm on the wall. The walls of her vagina squeezed down on my dick, and after a few more thrusts, I felt the rush of my own orgasm coming on.</p>
<p>I pulled out of her and backed away, my sudden departure from her body giving her the cue to move. She dropped to her knees in front of me and seized my shaft, aiming it at her face while she jacked it toward her with intent. Her body was heaving, her breasts swaying beneath me. The look of my baby sister kneeling in front of me, giving me one of the hungriest looks I had ever seen, was a magnificent sight that made me feel strangely powerful. I put a hand on the wall to steady myself as the first burst of my semen launched at her face, landing across her forehead and eyebrow. The next one struck her across her nose and mouth as she leaned further back. The remaining volleys landed across her neck and breasts as she jacked me until I stopped spraying. She dropped one hand to run it across her neck down to her breasts, spreading smears of my come across her while she kept the other on my cock. She made sure that she licked it clean, cracking open one eye to inspect her work, before moving under the shower's spray to clean off.</p>
<p>Exhausted, I sank to my knees on the floor of the shower and leaned against the wall. After she had cleaned herself up, she scooted up next to me. I wrapped my arms around her and gave her wet hair a kiss. She sighed contentedly and smiled up at me.</p>
<p>"I always wondered what that would feel like." She grinned.</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"It was pretty awesome. Made me feel so dirty, in a sexy way. Way too messy to do all the time, though. That's why I asked here. We're in the shower anyway." She laughed bashfully. "Did you like it?"</p>
<p>"It was pretty goddamned sexy, I have to admit. You have been going on like a woman possessed tonight. What that's about?" I hastily added. "I'm not complaining, mind you."</p>
<p>"I told you. I spent the last week having to talk about sex with Courtney every single night. And I couldn't even cuddle with my big brother after. I had a lot of pent up energy, I guess." She blushed. "At least you got to benefit from it, right?"</p>
<p>"Hell, yeah." I smiled. "I may need to send you to visit her more often."</p>
<p>The shower started rapidly cooling and we scurried to get out and dry ourselves. I tucked her into her bed, gave her a long kiss and sat on the edge of her bed chatting with her until she drifted off to sleep. It was good to be home again.</p>
<p>The remaining two weeks of the semester was very busy for both of us. First of all, I had to pick up my remaining work and profits from the Fall art show. Surprisingly, I had made a tidy sum of money from the show, having sold a total of five pieces, and set the money aside to use for Christmas presents, the big ticket item being something special I had in mind for Amy. We spent the majority of our time studying for finals and then actually taking the damned things. Surprisingly, I did rather well that semester. Not so surprisingly, Amy breezed through her math and finance finals like they were nothing.</p>
<p>I was quite busy working for Dr. Miller as well, spending time grading tests for him and crating up paintings at his private studio for an upcoming gallery opening that he was going to have in Chicago. Of course, no sooner do I make all the travel arrangements to accompany him to the gallery and attend the opening than our parents decide that they are going out of town that same weekend. Amy and I were both pretty irritated by that development. She had to work that weekend and it was too late for me to get out of going to Chicago with Dr. Miller, so we just had to suck it up and deal with it. That didn't stop the little brat from making comments hinting at various things she'd let me do to her and that she'd like to do to me if I stayed behind, however.</p>
<p>I was kept surprisingly busy behind the scenes at the opening. Everything from making sure the gallery adhered to Miller's pricing schedule to ensuring the pieces were hung to his specifications in terms of order and placement. By the time the opening actually took place, I was pretty worn out and spent the majority of my free time in Chicago napping at the hotel and texting Amy, aside from a quick dive into a music store that I had spotted to plunder their vinyl selection. I walked out of the place with four new albums, a rare extravagance for me.</p>
<p>My only other personal stop while there was at a jewelry store, where I spotted Amy's Christmas present in a display window. It was a beautiful white gold necklace with a teardrop shaped sapphire at its center, a small diamond rested on either side of the sapphire in the white gold setting. I thought it would really go well with several of the dresses I had seen her wear, and it would definitely complement her beautiful blue eyes.</p>
<p>I certainly looked out of place as I walked into the store. I had been hauling wooden shipping crates out of the back of a rental truck all morning, and I was dressed accordingly. The woman behind the counter shot me a look of disdain when I walked in wearing paint splattered khakis with a hole in one knee and my faded Einsturzende Neubauten shirt that I'd finally managed to reclaim from Amy. I guess I didn't look like a customer worthy of her trying to earn a commission from. She raised a surprised eyebrow when I pointed out the sapphire necklace that I wanted to see. The look on her face when I pulled out the cash to purchase it was even more amusing.</p>
<p>"Must be quite a girl." She commented with a smile as she rang up my purchase.</p>
<p>"She definitely is," I smiled back, still amused at her abrupt change of attitude.</p>
<p>She placed the necklace in a fancy jewelry box and placed that in what I considered to be an unnecessarily fancy black shopping bag along with my receipt and some sort of paperwork that proved the authenticity of the stones used in the necklace. I guessed these things mattered for something, but I wasn't about to ask the woman, providing her the satisfaction of knowing that I was indeed a low rent college student who was out of his depth in a place such as this. I spent the rest of my time in Chicago paranoid that I'd forget her gift there or that someone would steal it. It may have been the most expensive thing I had ever purchased, not counting my used car. I really hoped she liked it. It would be a hell of a drive to return it, I chuckled to myself.</p>
<p>Christmas time was always a big deal in our household, mostly due to our mother, who insisted on decorating the place up every year. She also insisted on live trees, which always made the living room smell pleasant and inviting. And made a hell of a mess, but that was another story. Despite our ages, our mother insisted on having Christmas stockings on the mantle every year. Even the stairs wound up with Christmas lights and garland wrapped up along the railings. It was quite a bit of overkill, in my opinion. But whatever. Hauling all that shit down out of the attic in boxes every year was one of the few things that my father and I ever did together, which strangely, made me look forward to it.</p>
<p>More than once, I'd come home from working for Dr. Miller to find Christmas music playing on the system in the living room and my mother singing along while she worked on dinner in the kitchen. This often led to me hauling ass to the relative safety of my room and, more importantly, the safety of the music collection residing on my laptop. In prior years, Amy would be squirreled away in her bedroom with her own music playing to block out the godawful supposedly joyful noise from downstairs. These days, she would hide out in my room with me most of the time. Not that she wouldn't have any other time of the year anyway.</p>
<p>She wasn't hiding at the moment, although she was in my room. She was stretched out face down on my bed, sleeping in her sweat pants and one of the many shirts she'd stolen from me. Our parents had left for my father's company Christmas party about an hour before, while I was still out helping John re-arrange stuff at his apartment to make space for his new roommate's furniture that was much better than the used crap that John had been using. When I arrived home, I thought the house was empty at first, until I got to my bedroom and discovered my lovely little sister asleep in my bed.</p>
<p>Now I was faced with a number of choices, many of them comical, and a couple of them sexual. Taking in the beautiful curves of her ass against the fabric of her sweatpants, the comical options pretty much went out the window. I sat gently on the edge of the bed and tucked an errant lock of her hair behind her ear.</p>
<p>"Hmm..." she purred and a small smile appeared on her lips. "You're home."</p>
<p>I ran my hand lovingly down her back, without any real agenda beyond just enjoying the feel of her. She yawned and performed a long, cat-like, full body stretch with her arms far above her head. It caused the shirt she was wearing to pull up exposing a bit of her midriff. My hand moved to the newly exposed patch of skin and was about to give the newly exposed flesh a gentle rub when she suddenly flinched away from me, writhing and giggling like mad.</p>
<p>"That tickles!" she squealed.</p>
<p>"So much for the gentle wake up call. My bad." I chuckled.</p>
<p>"You're gonna have to come over here and make it up to me." She replied, giving me a sly, seductive look.</p>
<p>I smirked as I crawled up onto the bed next to her. I dropped my hands to her sides again, sliding them under her shirt while ensuring that I used enough force to avoid tickling her this time.</p>
<p>"Can you give me a back rub, baby?" She asked after we made out for a few moments.</p>
<p>"No problem," I reply as I move to straddle her back legs just below her ass and start rubbing her lower back, palms wide,</p>
<p>"Mmm... That feels good." She moaned, as my hands moved across her back, massaging her.</p>
<p>Amy reached down and pulled her shirt up over her head and dropped it up by my pillow, giving me more access to her back. She hadn't been wearing a bra. I increased my efforts at giving a legitimate back rub, only now I was occasionally planting a kiss on her spine as I worked.</p>
<p>I worked my way up her sides, allowing my fingertips to drift down along her sides to graze the soft flesh where her breasts pushed out to the side from beneath her. I kneaded her muscles gently with the balls of my thumbs and she let out a groan of relaxation. By now, I was bending down hovering above her, my crotch resting on her ass. I paused just long enough to pull my shirt off and drop it to the floor. Then I settled back down on top of her, running my hands up her sides, along her arms, and sliding my hands over hers to grip them. My lips pressed to the back of her neck, kissing her in a soft line across her neck, making my way to her jaw. I kissed my way up to her ear, My lips found her earlobe and after whispering how much I loved her, I sucked on it gently.</p>
<p>Amy let out a slight moan, appreciating my touch. Her hands moved down the bed to her waist, hooking her thumbs into the band of her sweatpants and sliding them down her hips. She hadn't had any underwear on either. I let out a slow breath of appreciation as her beautiful ass came into view. I moved off of her so that she could slide her sweats off the rest of the way and stood to unbuckle my pants, dropping them to the floor. She gave my erection a hungry look and scooted over to sit on the edge of the bed and quickly wrap her lips around it.</p>
<p>"Oh god, Amy," I groaned as her mouth took me in and her tongue began swirling around the head of my cock. "That feels amazing!"</p>
<p>She dropped a hand between her legs and began rubbing herself, moaning softly around my cock. After sucking my member in long measured strokes for a few minutes, she somewhat begrudgingly released my cock from her mouth and moved back on the bed, beckoning me toward her with a curled finger and a seductive smile.</p>
<p>I moved back onto the bed next to her, and scooted into her open arms. We kissed, deeply and passionately, for several minutes as our hands roamed each others' bodies freely. Gently rolling her onto her back, I began placing small kisses and licks on her neck. My lips worked their way down along her shoulder. I brought a hand up to cup one of her creamy breasts, massaging her nipple as I caught it gently between my thumb and forefinger. She released a high pitched moan in response.</p>
<p>"I love the way your hands feel on me." She breathed. "I love... your mouth." Her voice seemed to tremble each time my lips touched her flesh. I relished, without ego, that I could have that effect on her.</p>
<p>I smiled to myself as my mouth continued to travel across her chest, making its way to her other breast. I fastened my mouth over her nipple, tracing it's outline with my tongue. Her breath quickened and one of her hands cupped the back of my head gently in appreciation. I felt her hips grinding her lower body up against my stomach as I bathed her nipple lovingly with my tongue. I caught the nipple between my lips and pulled on it gently. Her hips bucked hard against my stomach in response as she gasped sharply, and I began to smell her arousal.</p>
<p>As I made my way down her stomach, placing kisses down to the base of her hips, one of her hands started massaging her breasts while the other grabbed the bed sheet in a fist. Amy gasped loudly when I placed a kiss directly next to the top of her pelvic bone, a spot I had discovered was a highly erogenous zone for her. She was now writhing under my touch, her breath anxious in anticipation. I finally reached her beautiful, hairless lips and blew a hot breath of air across them. Her stomach fluttered visibly in response and her body tensed, waiting for me to make my move. Instead of the move she was probably expecting, I hooked my arms under her legs and cupped her wonderful ass in my hands. Her legs now rested on my shoulders as I raised her pelvis up from the bed toward my face.</p>
<p>She let out a mild yelp of surprise, followed by a loud moan as my tongue parted her folds in a series of long, slow licks. I thrust my tongue deep into her, drinking in her secretions as her body arched before me. I brought my lips up to her clitoris, circling it with my tongue, teasing it with light licks. Amy bucked her hips against my face, her body heaving in desire as my tongue spelled out my love for her.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"Oh fuck, baby! I'm gonna come!" She panted. I thrust my tongue back into her as deeply as I could, lapping at her fluids like a man dying of thirst. My hands clutched tightly at the cheeks of her ass, holding her to my face as she writhed against me. Her hands were grabbing at her tits, kneading them urgently.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Amy seized my head with her legs, trapping me between them. Her thighs were quivering urgently as she let out a loud cry. I held her tightly to my mouth, bathing her clit with my tongue as my beautiful little sister's orgasm rocked her to her core. My tongue moved further down, drinking in her wetness, trying to avoid overstimulating her as she rode out her orgasm.</p>
<p>When she finally subsided, and relaxed her grip on my head, I tilted my head and kissed her inner thigh. Her long delicate fingers ran affectionately through my hair, as she sighed contentedly above me.</p>
<p>I moved up on the bed, keeping her long, slender legs on my shoulders as I did, folding my beautiful baby sister beneath me with intention to bury myself as deeply inside her as I could.</p>
<p>Amy had her arms on my sides, pulling me up to her. She suddenly let out slight gasp, as my hard prick brushed across her tiny pink rosebud, more exposed at the moment by her position with her legs on my shoulders. Her hands moved up to stop me momentarily, and her half closed piercing blue eyes met mine.</p>
<p>"Do you want to try it?" She asked softly.</p>
<p>"Your ass?"</p>
<p>She nodded, chewing her lower lip as she looked for my response. This was something I'd never done, but I was intrigued by it as I had always loved her majestic ass. But, I'd also seen enough porn to know how easily I could hurt her if I did it wrong. The look on her face told me she wanted this.</p>
<p>"I do, but I've never tried it before. I don't want to hurt you." I replied, suddenly a bit nervous.</p>
<p>"Me, either." She gave me a small grin as she slowly rocked her pelvis, lewdly rubbing her anus against my erection. "We'll be careful."</p>
<p>I leaned my head forward and kissed her deeply, with her returning in kind. She patted my shoulder after a second, grinning into my mouth.</p>
<p>"There some lube in my nightstand." She whispered, "Top drawer."</p>
<p>I kissed her forehead and slipped out of the bed. I felt a little exposed and ridiculous as I went down the hall to her bedroom with my erection swinging out in front of me. Even though I knew we were alone in the house, I still felt self conscious about it. I quickly grabbed the bottle from her nightstand and went back to my room. What I saw when I walked through the door stopped me in my tracks.</p>
<p>Amy was laying on her stomach when I returned, a pillow beneath her hips propped her gorgeous ass up toward me invitingly. She looked over her naked shoulder at me as I entered the room, flashing me a seductive smile and a wink. My cock lurched involuntarily at the sexy vision before me and her smile widened a little when she saw it.</p>
<p>"Holy shit, Amy." I exhaled appreciatively as I sat on the edge of the bed. "You look amazing."</p>
<p>She smiled, and then almost purred in response to my touch as I started to massage her thighs. This was something new that I wasn't entirely sure how to best approach. Most porn makes everything look unrealistically easy, and enjoyable. I knew she needed to be as relaxed as possible if I wanted to avoid hurting her, so I started with a massage. I worked my way up to her upper thighs, and ass cheeks, working on first one side and then the other. Her contented sighs told me I was on the right track.</p>
<p>I let one of my hand slide down to cup her mound, feeling the heat radiating from it. She let out a moan as I rubbed her slowly, purposely getting my fingers slick with her arousal. I lowered myself on the bed and kissed the back of her inner thigh, just below where thigh becomes ass. Then I planted a few kisses on her ass cheek as I worked my way to her center. I moved my hand away to give her lips a long lick, passing up over the skin between her two entrances and making a circular motion over her orifice. Her body shivered below me. She started giggling.</p>
<p>"What?" I asked.</p>
<p>"You just kissed my ass again. I'm sorry. I shouldn't laugh. Keep going."</p>
<p>I grinned a little myself at the thought, and squirted a little of the lube into my hand, blowing in my hand to warm it and then coating my finger liberally. My mouth moved back down to rim her a few more times, which caused her giggles to be replaced with soft moans. I gently stroked down her side with one hand while bringing the lubed one up to trace the outline of her tiny orifice with my lubed finger. I applied gentle pressure and her ass permitted my fingertip to enter. Amy's small hand shot down to grab the hand that was lovingly stroking her hip. I paused, but she motioned for me to continue. She let out a whimper as my finger continued into her. I moved very slowly and carefully, listening for any sign that she wanted me to stop. I began moving my finger in and out of her, while my other hand remained gripped in hers. After a few minutes of this, I added a second finger, feeling her ass stretch to take me in. She turned her head to face me with a slight moan, but she didn't open her eyes. I kept working my fingers in and out of her gently, while planting kisses on her hip, side and back, until I felt she was ready for me to go further.</p>
<p>"If you want to stop, just say so. I won't be upset." I told her.</p>
<p>She smiled softly and nodded in reply.</p>
<p>I positioned myself behind her, and applied a generous amount of lube to my hardened shaft. I placed the head of my penis against her tiny hole and applied a little pressure. She grunted beneath me as the head penetrated her tight opening. I waited a few moments, letting her adjust before attempting to continue.</p>
<p>"You okay?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah, keep going." She assured me, but she took my free hand in hers again.</p>
<p>I carefully pushed myself deeper into her, I could feel the ring of her sphincter expanding and sliding over my shaft. The heat coming from her was incredible. It was a sensation completely different from vaginal sex, just as oral was a unique feeling. I had never felt anything gripping my length as tightly as this. It felt incredible. I paused immediately when she let out a groan that did not sound like pleasure to me. I looked at her questioningly.</p>
<p>"Just... give me a minute." Amy gasped. I could feel her ass clenching me. I desperately wanted to keep going, but nothing was worth hurting her over and I didn't move a muscle. She took a ragged breath and nodded for me to continue.</p>
<p>I slowly started pushing again, and her incredible ass took more of me in. She was breathing really heavy, and let out low groan as I continued sliding in. The groan became higher in pitch just as I was as far into her as I could go, my groin resting fully against her ass cheeks. I didn't move for a few moments, giving her time to adjust.</p>
<p>"I'm okay," She hissed through her teeth. My penis twitched inside her of its own volition. She let out a tiny whimper in response.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" I asked, stroking her back gently with my hand, kissing the back of her shoulder as I lay on top of her. "You don't sound okay."</p>
<p>"I just feel so full." She gasped, as if speaking was a challenge. "But I'm okay. Keep going."</p>
<p>"I won't be upset if you need to stop, Amy. I'm serious. I don't want to hurt you."</p>
<p>She squeezed my hand hard when I said that, and her mouth curled up in a smile. I felt her ass tighten its grip on me and relax as if to emphasize her acceptance.</p>
<p>"I know you won't hurt me, baby. I'm fine. It's just really intense."</p>
<p>I kissed her cheek, unable to reach her mouth from the way we were currently positioned, and slowly withdrew, before pushing back into her just as slowly. I kept going this way for several excruciatingly long strokes while she moaned deeply with each thrust. Very gently, I increased my pace a little at a time and she began to respond more favorably to my thrusts. Her moans and gasps sounded completely different from when I was in her pussy, deeper and heavier, but she didn't sound like she was in pain.</p>
<p>Before long, I was moving inside her at a normal speed and unable to keep from moaning myself. My hands moved along her body in unison as my cock thrust in her tight asshole. The feeling was indescribable and I knew it would not last long. By now, she was pushing back against me, groaning appreciatively. I planted kissed on her shoulders and neck as I kept up my rhythm.</p>
<p>"I'm going to come soon, baby." I whispered harshly. That seemed to encourage her further and she ground her ass back against me hard.</p>
<p>"Fill me." She groaned. "I want to feel your come in me."</p>
<p>A few more thrusts and I did that very thing. Her ass clenched around my shaft tightly, just as my orgasm hit and for a brief moment, I wasn't sure I would even be able to come with her clenching me that tightly. I let out a long ragged breath against her shoulder blade as my cock forcefully launched long ropes of semen deep into her bowels. She gripped my hand as tightly as she could, screaming into the mattress below her as my cock bathed her depths.</p>
<p>She released my hand and relaxed into the bed beneath me. I collapsed against her, my lips resting softly against her neck as she caught her breath. We lay like that for a few minutes after our orgasms subsided. Finally, I rolled off of her, my rapidly deflating cock sliding from her body. She let out a quiet sigh as I removed myself. Amy's beautiful eyes looked deep into mine as I lay next to her, my hand on her cheek, and an mischievous grin slowly crept across her face.</p>
<p>"What?" I grinned back, only because it was impossible not to smile when she gave me that particular look with the gleam in her eye.</p>
<p>"You just assfucked your baby sister. That's dirty." She whispered, smirking.</p>
<p>"I suppose I did," I snickered, having not thought of it quite that way. It did sound really dirty, not to mention completely perverse, when she put it like that. "Did you like it?"</p>
<p>"It's really different. Really, really intense. Courtney told me you have to really trust someone before you do it that way and now I know what she meant. It'd be really easy for you to hurt me. But I knew you wouldn't. You were wonderful about it." She kissed me, deeply. "I liked it a lot. But it's really intense. I could feel every movement, no matter how small, from your body. Everything. We can't do that every day, but I definitely want to do it once in a while."</p>
<p>"It was pretty incredible," I agreed. "And different. Definitely intense."</p>
<p>"But the best part," She looked at me seriously, her eyes suddenly looking very emotional, "is that it's something we both had never done. It's just ours, baby." Her lips locked with mine again in a long, gentle kiss.</p>
<p>"You're so amazing to me." She continued. "I wish sometimes I was still a virgin when we got together. But I wasn't. I didn't realize how special you were, even though you were right under my nose the whole time. If I had known, I would have saved everything for you. No one would have ever been allowed to even kiss me before you. But at least I saved this for you and only you."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter to me who did what before, sweetheart." I replied, taking her in my arms. I understood that it was something that was clearly important to Amy. "We love each other. Now is all that matters, right?"</p>
<p>"I know. I just think about it sometimes. That's one reason I wanted to try it." She sighed happily in my embrace. "I love you."</p>
<p>Christmas morning, almost a week later, was the usual calm family event that it had been over the last few years now that Amy and I were mature enough not to cover the living room in shredded wrapping paper, leaving a gigantic path of destruction behind us. I couldn't consciously remember when it had changed for me, but somewhere along the way, I became more excited about giving gifts and seeing the excitement in a person's eyes than I did in acquiring more stuff. I mused that growing up was a weirdly gradual process. You didn't just flip a switch one day and discover that you were mature. You seemed to ease into it without knowing.</p>
<p>I found it hard to keep my eyes off of Amy that morning. She was sitting on the sofa across from me in her pajamas and bathrobe, with her legs curled up under her. Her long black hair was kind of wild from having crawled out of bed shortly before, and she was giving me a sexy smile behind her mug of hot chocolate.</p>
<p>The gift exchange was a pleasant and mild affair. Amy's real gift was still gift wrapped and stashed under her pillow in her bedroom, where I hoped she would discover it later tonight after everyone went to bed. The present she'd unwrapped downstairs was of the normal, brotherly variety. I'd given her a nice green blouse similar to the one I had accidentally ruined many months ago, the night she'd come to me after Jeff had cheated on her, and a couple of movies that she had mentioned wanting to see. She gave me a really nice leather bound sketchbook that was refillable, along with a nice new calligraphy pen and a pack of acid free, heavy grade sketch paper. It was a really high quality pen, and I couldn't wait to try it out.</p>
<p>We spent the afternoon at our grandmother's house across town, hanging out with more members of the extended family and waiting for Christmas dinner. Naturally, this meant I spent the majority of the afternoon attempting to be invisible in a corner of the living room with a sketchbook. I didn't dislike my family, I was just quiet by nature and didn't have the kind of personality that lent itself to navigating rooms full of people backslapping and hugging everyone. It just wasn't in me. I would have much preferred to spend my day at home curled up in bed with my lovely little sister. That said, it did always make me smile to watch how effortlessly she moved through a room, commanding attention and guiding conversations. She seemed to have the ability to glide through the place without the constant feelings of awkwardness and self-consciousness that plagued me at all times when faced with more than three or four people at a time. Then again, she was a ravishing creature, and fully capable of making anyone stop and pay attention.</p>
<p>By the time we finally got home, Mom was fairly tipsy and our father shuffled her off to bed. Our mother didn't drink enough to get drunk very often, but for some reason, visiting our grandmother's generally seemed to bring it out in her. I think it was just that she got along so well with so many of the relatives there that she felt comfortable enough for it.</p>
<p>I set about cleaning up the last bits of debris from the living room's festivities that morning and wandered into the kitchen to grab a beer on my way upstairs. Amy was doing some dishes in the kitchen and after a quick glance toward the downstairs hall to make sure the coast was clear, I gave her a quick hug and planted a kiss on her neck. She grinned and leaned back against me for a moment, her hands full of dishwater that she mercifully kept to herself. I grabbed a beer from the fridge and retreated to my room.</p>
<p>After putting on a This Mortal Coil album, I settled in at the drafting table with my new calligraphy pen and started on a drawing. About twenty minutes later, Amy walked in holding the still wrapped present I'd stashed under her pillow.</p>
<p>"What's this?" She asked, quizzically.</p>
<p>"Looks like a Christmas present to me." I replied, as I began rinsing out the tip on the calligraphy pen.</p>
<p>"I know that much, jackass." Amy retorted, rolling her eyes at me. She sat on the edge of the bed looking down at it.</p>
<p>"Are you just gonna stare at it and insult people or are you gonna open it?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I didn't get you anything else, baby." She looked up at me apologetically.</p>
<p>"You didn't need to. I just didn't want to give you your real present in front of anyone." I leaned back in my desk chair, hoping like hell that she would like it.</p>
<p>Finally, she tore the wrapper off of the small black jewelry box and looked the box over. She smiled up at me.</p>
<p>"You got me jewelry?"</p>
<p>"Actually, I just liked the box, dingbat. I thought you could store stamps in it or something."</p>
<p>Amy cracked the box open and stared down at it with her jaw on the floor. She reached in the box and slowly moved the necklace with her finger as if she didn't think it was real.</p>
<p>"Adam!" She breathed. "This is beautiful!"</p>
<p>"You like it?"</p>
<p>"I love it!" She exclaimed.</p>
<p>I pulled the paperwork from my desk drawer and passed it to her.</p>
<p>"What's this?" She asked, looking in the envelope at the certificates.</p>
<p>"Some kind of paperwork they gave me with the necklace, verifying the authenticity of the stones and some warranty information."</p>
<p>"You mean these are natural gem stones?" Her eyes went wide. Clearly, she knew something about jewelry that I definitely did not.</p>
<p>"Yeah, there are unnatural ones?" I was puzzled.</p>
<p>She nodded but didn't answer as she flipped through the paperwork. Her eyes moved up from the papers to look at me.</p>
<p>"This must have cost you a fortune."</p>
<p>I shrugged, and didn't comment.</p>
<p>"This is too much." She said.</p>
<p>"It's not enough," I replied, smiling. I was quite satisfied with myself for having blown her away.</p>
<p>She nearly tackled me out of my chair, planting kisses all over my face.</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas, beautiful." I said to her, as soon as it was safe to do so.</p>
<p>The Spring semester schedule ensured that I'd be insanely busy. In addition to my art classes, I also enrolled in some required history and literature courses. Between the homework load and working for Dr. Miller, I was reasonably sure that the semester would fly by. I had put off the literature course for a few semesters now, and it was one also required for Amy's finance degree, so we managed to schedule that class together. We were both amused by that, as we'd never taken a class together in our lives, thanks to me being the older one. In her younger days, I'd helped her with her homework occasionally, before it became obvious that she was more adept at schoolwork than I was.</p>
<p>One night out at the bar, drinking a beer with John, I saw Megan walk in, Man-bun in tow, and go meet some people at a table across the room. A short while later, she spotted me and broke away from her friends to come over to our table. Her hair was blonde, on this particular occasion. A color I hadn't seen her have before, and I thought it looked out of place on her, but I wouldn't dream of telling her so.</p>
<p>"Hey Meg, what's up?" John asked.</p>
<p>"Not a lot. Just saw that you managed to get the recluse out of his cave for once and I thought I'd come say hello." She grinned at me.</p>
<p>"How's things going with Man-bun?" He prodded. Her eyes cut at him in annoyance.</p>
<p>"Great, really great actually." She replied, attempting to avoid the bait. "But, seriously, Adam..."</p>
<p>I was midway through polishing off the last of my beer and raised my eyebrows expectantly.</p>
<p>"You know that band Gorath?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Gorath was a local death metal band that played a lot of the local festivals and did the occasional club show. I thought they sucked, but I seemed to be in the minority.</p>
<p>"I'm doing the band photo for their new album, and they asked me to reach out to you about using one of your paintings for their album cover."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah? For free, I'm sure." I rolled my eyes.</p>
<p>"Nope. They got signed to some indie label and have a budget for the album. Not much, but it's something. Interested? They asked for you specifically."</p>
<p>"Maybe. I guess I could talk to them about it." I replied. I wasn't sure I had time to be bothering with it, but I'd give it a look. Not to mention that, despite my opinion of the band, they had a lot of fans around here and the exposure couldn't hurt.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>"Cool. I'll let them know." She started to turn back to her friends, and paused. Her hand fell to my forearm for a moment, and she smiled. "It's good to see you."</p>
<p>"Take care." I replied, as she walked away.</p>
<p>"Tell Man-bun we said hello," John called after her. She extended her middle finger over her shoulder at us and looked back with a grin when she heard us snickering.</p>
<p>John flagged a waitress and motioned for them to bring another beer. Looking back over at me and leaned forward.</p>
<p>"What happened with you two, anyway? You never have told me."</p>
<p>"Nothing. There never really was anything serious there. It just ended is all." I replied.</p>
<p>"If you say so." He shrugged. "I just see how she looks at you once in a while."</p>
<p>"She seems pretty happy with Man-bun." I nodded my head toward them, where Megan was currently folded up in Man-bun's lap.</p>
<p>"They do look good together." John acknowledged, "aside from that fuzzy ass cinnamon roll strapped to the back of his head."</p>
<p>We both started cracking up.</p>
<p>A few days later, I met with a couple of the guys from Gorath. They looked over some of my sketchbooks, pointing out things that they liked and giving me some ideas of what they were looking for. We hammered out the details of how much I would be paid, which wasn't much. And they gave me a small deposit and thanked me. I walked away from the meeting with the impression that they were definitely fans of my stuff, and I felt a tiny bit guilty that I was not able to say the same of theirs.</p>
<p>The work went faster than expected, and I met with the band again a few weeks later to show them four possible covers I had created. This time the entire band was there. They argued among themselves for the better part of an hour, looking over the options. After a spirited process of elimination, they settled on the design that I had liked the least. I chuckled as I collected the art back together. We made arrangements for me to deliver the finished piece the following week and for me to sign the release forms to allow it to be reproduced as an album cover. All in all, it was a pretty painless process. I made a mental note to look into the possibility of marketing myself to local bands as an artist for hire.</p>
<p>It was beginning to feel like I was making a bit of a name for myself around town as an artist. While I still had no illusions about trying to make a career out of art, the world was full of starving artists after all, I couldn't help taking a bit of pleasure out of the minuscule amount of income my paintings were generating.</p>
<p>The night before all hell broke loose, I was sitting on the sofa watching a nature documentary while Amy showered upstairs. She had just gotten home from a long day at work and I had picked up dinner for us while she was out. I was feeling pretty lazy, slouched on the sofa with my feet propped up on the coffee table. Our parents were away for a few days at some conference for our dad's work and wouldn't be back until the day after tomorrow. It was so much more relaxing when they were away and we didn't have to hide ourselves away in one of our bedrooms.</p>
<p>I took a swig from my can of coke and noticed the water shut off upstairs. My beautiful little sister would be down soon for dinner and I was really looking forward to spending time with her, as always. I had considered joining her in the shower, but she looked so tired when she came home from work that I wanted to give her a chance to relax. I went to the kitchen and pulled the cartons of food from the oven, where I'd left them to warm. Taking plates down from the cabinet, I saw her padding into the kitchen in her bathrobe, her hair pulled up in a ponytail.</p>
<p>"Hey, beautiful. Feel better?" I asked, as I leaned over to kiss her forehead.</p>
<p>She wrapped her arms around me in a lazy hug, resting her head on my shoulder while I held the dinner plates off to one side awkwardly. I wasn't complaining, of course, it was just that the physics of the situation made it hard to look entirely graceful.</p>
<p>"I had such a long day." She sighed. Then she sniffed the air, as she let go of me. "What smells so good?"</p>
<p>"I picked up dinner for us earlier, just before you got home. Hope you wanted Italian."</p>
<p>She flashed me one of her brightest smiles, and my heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>"I am totally in the mood for Italian."</p>
<p>"Perfect, then. Go park your gorgeous ass in the living room and relax. I'll bring you a plate in just a few." I smiled.</p>
<p>"You are so good to me," She sighed happily, as she wrapped me in another hug. She padded back down to the living room while I finished getting the plates ready.</p>
<p>We watched a movie while we ate and Amy cuddled up next to me on the sofa when we finished. At some point during the film, she fell asleep with her head on my shoulder. I knew she was exhausted from her day and decided to let her nap a while. I had the remote within reach, mercifully, and flipped channels until I found something worth watching.</p>
<p>Some time later, she stirred and nuzzled her face up against my neck. I smiled and kissed the top of her head, smelling the strawberry scented shampoo she used on her hair. Her lips touched my neck in a soft kiss, then parted as she gave my neck a small lick.</p>
<p>"Someone's awake." I grinned slightly.</p>
<p>"Mmmm" Was her only reply, as her hand came up to cradle my head as she kissed my neck again, planting her lips on it and sucking against my throat. I could feel her lips curl into a grin against my neck and experience told me that she was pleased with the bruise that she'd just left there. She shifted herself around on the sofa, turning to fully face me on all fours like a cat, and gave a very feline looking full body stretch.</p>
<p>She moved up to straddle me, her knees drawn up on either side of me as she took my head in her hands and began kissing her way up my neck to my ear. My cock got the message that its favorite person was on the move and began to be uncomfortable in my shorts. Her robe had partially fallen open by now, partially exposing her full breasts. She nibbled my earlobe gently, before moving up to put her lips to my ear and whisper how much she loved me.</p>
<p>My hands slid inside her robe, pulling the knot loose the rest of the way and fully exposing her creamy breasts to me. She shrugged out of the robe, letting it drop the floor behind her and wrapped her arms back around my neck to kiss me. My hands stroked her back, roaming over her body down to her hips and back. She moaned through our kiss when one of my hands found her left breast and kneaded it softly. Our mouths separated, both of us gasping to catch our breath, and she raised herself up allowing my lips access to her nipples.</p>
<p>"I know how to take a hint," I mumbled, just before my lips latched to her nipple. Her giggle at my statement disappeared into a moan as her chin rested on top of my head. She used one hand to support herself on the back of the sofa and the other was wrapped around my head holding me to her breast as I suckled on it.</p>
<p>"Jesus," she gasped, "I love what you do to me."</p>
<p>I brought a hand down to stroke one of her fabulous ass cheeks, causing her to purr appreciatively. She dropped her hips down to grind herself against my erection. She grunted in disapproval and disengaged from me for a moment to pull her panties off. I set some kind of speed record in removing my shorts and boxers. No sooner did my ass touch the sofa cushion again than she was back on me, grinding herself directly on my stiff cock. We both groaned at the sensation. I lost myself in the moment, wanting nothing more than to bury myself in her beautiful body as far as I could right that second.</p>
<p>"I need you," I breathed, thrusting my hips up to match her grinding. She whimpered at my words and I could feel the heat radiating from her crotch against my hard cock. She raised herself up positioning my dick at her entrance.</p>
<p>"Then take me." She whimpered. "I'm all yours."</p>
<p>I thrust up into her, our bodies joining, and a long groan escaped me as her white hot pussy enveloped my dick to the hilt. We started fucking in earnest, me sitting back on the sofa, her sitting up straddling me. My cock gliding in and out of her in a blur as she began breathing rapidly at the force of my thrusts.</p>
<p>"Oh god, yes! Take me, Adam! Take me!" She nearly screamed, her body writhing above me. I watched her breasts bouncing wildly as I brought myself up into her repeatedly. I had one hand on the small of her back, and the other pawing at her breasts.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she arched herself backward, propping one hand on the coffee table. If I moved my hand from her back, she would have fallen. Her breasts were thrust up at me and I seized one in my free hand, pinching the nipple between my fingers. She was an erotic vision, slamming her pelvis down to meet my thrusts. I felt the tingling in my balls and knew I was not far from coming.</p>
<p>"You've so amazing." I gasped. "I'm gonna come soon."</p>
<p>"Do it!" She cried. "I want to feel you come!"</p>
<p>I seized her hips with my hands, pulling her forward to me and slammed myself into her as the first jet of my semen launched deep into her. It must have triggered her own orgasm because she cried out and started shaking as her pussy pulsed over my twitching erection. I felt my body launch several more volleys of semen into her before it subsided and I relaxed my grip on her hips. She settled back against me, gasping for breath, and wrapped her arms around my neck.</p>
<p>"I love you so much." I breathed. She was still coming down from her orgasm, breathing heavily in my ear, and just kissed the side of my head in reply.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, she went to the bathroom to clean up a bit, and came back wearing her panties again. She had a damp rag that she used to clean me up, and I pulled my boxers back on after. Amy wrapped herself up around me in a lover's embrace and we collapsed back down on the sofa. Within moments, my sweet baby sister was asleep in my arms. I fell asleep myself a few minutes later.</p>
<p>"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!" My father's voice boomed through the house.</p>
<p>I snapped awake and shot to my feet just as Amy did the same. She covered her naked breasts with her arms and stared, wide eyed and pale, at our parents. They had come back early. In the past year, this was the first time that they had come back early. We'd slept right through them unlocking the door and walking in. To make matters worse, we'd fallen asleep on the couch downstairs, where we had sex the night before We were both still dressed in only our underwear. There was never a chance to react.</p>
<p>"Dad, calm do-" I began, slowly positioning myself between my rapidly approaching father and Amy.</p>
<p>The look on his face and his body language genuinely frightened me. I didn't think it was likely that he would hurt Amy, but I wanted her as far from harm's way as I could get her, just in case.</p>
<p>"SHUT THE FUCK UP!" He roared. He stopped just a couple of feet from me.</p>
<p>"Why the FUCK is she NAKED?" His eyes burned with rage, as the screaming continued. "What the FUCK did you do to her?"</p>
<p>I stared at him for a moment, trying to figure out what to say. I saw the hate in his eyes and knew there was no way this could possibly go well. There was no lie that would resolve this, so I just went for the truth.</p>
<p>"I love her."</p>
<p>My face exploded in pain as his fist collided with my nose. I stumbled back a few steps, trying to get my thoughts straightened out around the searing pain in my face. Before I could say a word, I registered just a flash of movement and felt a fist collide with my stomach. I went to my knees, fighting hard not to vomit from the pain in my gut.</p>
<p>"DADDY, NO!" I heard Amy shriek behind me. I saw Amy from corner of my eye as she rushed forward. I tried to catch her with my arm, but wasn't quite fast enough. She slipped between us, holding an open hand up toward him. "You don't underst-"</p>
<p>"She's your GODDAMNED sister, you disgusting shit!" He yelled over her, shoving her aside as if she were weightless.</p>
<p>His foot struck me in the ribs and I thought I felt two of them snap. Bolts of pain shot through my chest like daggers, weirdly seeming to originate deep inside my body. Fucking hell, it hurt. I couldn't think for a moment, everything focused on the pain resonating in my chest. I rolled to my side, hoping he was done, struggling to breathe. Amy's arms wrapped around me just at that moment, trying to shield me.</p>
<p>"DADDY, I love him! STOP!" She pleaded as he jerked her away from me like a rag doll. Her fingernails dug into my arm, accidentally scratching me as she tried to hold on. I saw her stumble back onto the sofa, and noticed her grab one of mom's vases from the coffee table. Oh shit, I thought.</p>
<p>I coughed and noticed flecks of blood hit the tile floor just before I realized a kick was coming. I moved to block it, but too slow, flinching in pain and felt the connect. He missed my ribs thanks to me trying to roll and hit the soft tissue beneath. I felt a weird pain and a shift of my organs that definitely did not feel natural. This time I puked bile. Thankfully not a lot, but enough to make my throat burn.</p>
<p>I was too blinded by pain to remember the vase for a moment, but as soon as I did, I shot a look toward the sofa. Mom, streaming tears, had Amy in her arms, struggling to keep her there and whispering to her. Amy still clutched the vase in one hand, gulping air from her adrenaline, her eyes pleading with mine for some affirmation that I was okay.</p>
<p>He didn't kick me again. He just glared down at me with his nostrils flaring, but didn't move from where he was. Very painfully, I pulled myself up to my knees, straining against the pain in my chest. I sucked air between my teeth as I struggled to my feet, using the recliner for support.</p>
<p>"Daddy, it's not his fault." Amy cried. I looked over at my beautiful baby sister, my princess, as tears poured down her face, her eyes fixed on me in horror. She had snatched her bathrobe from the floor and was holding it over her breasts. It was most certainly my fault, I thought, but air didn't seem to want to fill my lungs enough to let me say so. I gave her a nod, trying to be reassuring, which probably didn't work since I had blood dripping all down my chin from my nose. I looked back at my father, waiting for the rest of what was coming. More hits? A call to the police? I wasn't sure where this was heading. I was gulping like a fish out of water, trying to get enough oxygen in my body while every breath felt like I had napalm searing through my lungs.</p>
<p>"You have thirty minutes." He spoke in an even tone.</p>
<p>"What?" I choked out. I heard the words, but they didn't connect to anything in my head. I kept seeing white at the corners of my vision and fought to focus, afraid I was going to pass out. I was familiar with this, having seen the white in my vision field before, when I was struck in the head by a skateboard at the park years before. What a time to have a memory flashback.</p>
<p>"You have thirty minutes. Get your shit and get the fuck out of my house. You don't live here anymore." He repeated. I recognized a glint of satisfaction in his eye. I had finally proven myself to be the disappointment he always wanted me to be. My black sheep status had been fully earned and achieved. I would have seethed if I didn't hurt so badly. "You are not welcome here."</p>
<p>"Dad." I began as Amy started sobbing again, wordlessly. She was gasping so hard, I thought she'd hyperventilate.</p>
<p>"You don't get to call me that anymore. I don't have a son." He glared. My mother burst into a fresh round of tears.</p>
<p>"Thomas..." My mother began, but stopped when she saw the look that he shot her. I had never gotten the impression that he was ever violent toward her, but she backed down rapidly. The rage I saw in him must have frightened her as well.</p>
<p>"I love him, Daddy!" Amy cried, "Don't do this!"</p>
<p>"Thirty minutes. You'd better start packing." He said, as though she weren't even there. It was easy to see how this was going to play out.</p>
<p>I very painfully went to the stairs, pausing to look back at Amy who was still being held in place by my mother. I was grateful for mom, worried that Amy would make herself a target of our father's wrath. I was certain I'd end up in prison if that happened. There would be no stopping me.</p>
<p>"It'll be alright, Amy." I said, trying to be reassuring, although I wasn't very sure of that. I just needed her to be safe. She had to calm down.</p>
<p>My father's eyes burned with a fresh rage hearing me speak to his daughter. I stared back at him with determination. I'd taken all the beating I was going to, I thought. One more step and I'd fight back. I'd lose, given how badly I hurt. But I'd fight back.</p>
<p>I struggled up the staircase, trying not to look in as much physical pain as I felt, for her sake, and leaned on the wall of the hallway for support. I was sweating from the exertion and adrenaline. In my room, I struggled to grab the most important things from my room. I grabbed my laptop and sketchbooks, shoving them in my schoolbag. I grabbed a gym bag from the closet and shoved clothes in it. I could hear yelling downstairs as I packed. I strained to listen for any sign of violence. I would play along for now and find a more peaceful way to resolve this. I didn't think he would hurt her. I had no doubt he would love the chance to work on me some more, but I was fairly sure that she was safe.</p>
<p>Every step I took was torture, the pain in my sides and face was tremendous. I wiped my face with a paint rag and saw an alarming amount of blood on the rag. There was a sharp stab every time I took a breath. I wondered if this was what a punctured lung felt like. I decided to go to the emergency room when I left here. I'd have to make up a story of some kind, but I thought I may be seriously hurt. I couldn't tell, I wasn't thinking clearly around the searing white hot pain.</p>
<p>When I made the first extremely painful trip down the staircase, I saw my father pacing back and forth in the living room. I didn't see anyone else. I dropped my bags in the trunk of my car and went back upstairs to pack more of my stuff. Mom's car was gone. She had taken Amy somewhere, I guessed.</p>
<p>"You are not to come back here. Not to stay. Not to visit. You are through in this household." He said to me, not roaring this time. His voice was hard and grim. "After you leave today, I never want to lay eyes on you again."</p>
<p>"We never meant for you to find out like this. We were going to sit you guys down and talk to you about it."</p>
<p>"It wouldn't make a difference. You fucking degenerate piece of shit. Get your crap and go."</p>
<p>"Where's Amy?"</p>
<p>"She went with your mother. Now get out of my house." He growled.</p>
<p>After I finished packing the things that I needed the most and loading the car, I pulled away from the house with a little less than five minutes to spare. I parked at the end of the street and waited. Mom's car was still not in the driveway. She and Amy did not return in the several hours that followed.</p>
<p>I sat in the car for a long time. I cried sporadically, which hurt like hell every time my chest heaved. I wait until nearly dark, but never saw any sign of them. I punched the steering wheel in frustration, sending fresh lightning bolts of pain through my sides, and cursed aloud.</p>

<p>Part Five.</p>
<p>I sat on the bench outside of the hospital for a long while. I don't know if I was feeling shock, exhaustion, or just complete emotional devastation. Maybe I hurt so badly inside that my body shut down all feeling in response. I'm not sure. All I know is that I simply felt hollow. Hollow and numb.</p>
<p>It could have been all the goddamned painkillers they had given me for all I knew.</p>
<p>Finally, I made myself get up and start walking, although I wasn't sure where I was going yet. I walked about twenty yards, into the park that was next door to the hospital, and fell to my knees at the base of a large tree. I suddenly broke out in a silent sob, ignoring the searing pain coming from the center of my face. There were no tears. I felt like my chest was caving in on nothing at all and I had trouble breathing. I briefly wondered if this was what a heart attack felt like, but felt no numbness in my arm. I had only heard about the numbness thing, and had no idea if it was accurate for diagnosing heart attacks. I later suspected that this might have been a panic attack.</p>
<p>I must have been a sight as I walked through the park. Some guy with his face all bruised up from the broken nose, meandering aimlessly across a public park in a blood stained shirt. I noticed more than one person staring at me, not that I cared. I let out a dry, humorless chuckle when I reflected on the coincidence that I had left Amy's last boyfriend looking very much like I did now. Amy. I wanted to find Amy so badly. But they hadn't thrown her out. She still had somewhere to live. Maybe I should stay away for a while and give our father time to cool down. I didn't want to make it worse for her.</p>
<p>By the time dusk had arrived, I returned to my car and drove a while, finding myself standing in front of Dr. Miller's studio. I didn't know where else to go. If I went to one of my friends, I'd have to explain what had taken place. That was not something I could handle right now, and I had at least enough clarity to know that much. John may have let it go for a little while, but eventually he'd make it his life's work to get the story out of me. Meg? Hell, no. That would cause more trouble than it would solve. I let myself in the studio and sat gingerly onto the sofa in the back of the room. The doctor had told me my cracked ribs would hurt for weeks. Slouching on the sofa was out. Instead, I leaned back against an armrest carefully avoiding putting pressure on my kidney. I was under strict instruction to return to the hospital if I saw blood in my urine and to avoid putting unnecessary pressure on my left kidney where I had been kicked. Out of sheer exhaustion, I slipped into the fitful sleep of those who know, without question, that they will never be the same again.</p>
<p>When I woke up, I saw Dr. Miller sitting at one of the tables with a cup of coffee. He heard me stirring, and turned his head toward me.</p>
<p>"What the hell happened to you, Adam?"</p>
<p>I hadn't thought this far ahead, and didn't know what to say. I looked down at the hospital bracelet still on my wrist.</p>
<p>"I was in an accident. I didn't know where else to go."</p>
<p>"You couldn't go home?" He poured a second cup of coffee and slid it over to me.</p>
<p>"I... can't go home." I felt the brace on my nose shift as my face struggled to stay composed. "I don't have one anymore, I guess."</p>
<p>"I see." He sighed, and looked at me sternly. "Are you in some kind of serious trouble? Legally, I mean."</p>
<p>"I don't think so." I shook my head. "Not drugs or anything like that, if that's what you are asking."</p>
<p>"What kind of trouble are you in, then?" He looked down at the coffee in front of me and back at me.</p>
<p>"The kind that makes me it were something as simple as a drug problem by comparison." I mumbled as I picked up the cup and took a sip. The brace kept shifting on my nose and was just too irritating. I pulled it off and dropped it on the table.</p>
<p>He smirked a little at that. "Good. You still have a bit of wise ass in you, at least."</p>
<p>"Dr. Miller, I don't know what to do. I feel like everything in my life has been ripped away from me." I surprised myself at how it felt to say that out loud. I sounded like a whining asshole. "And now I sound melodramatic. Crap."</p>
<p>"Call me Jeff, Adam. This isn't about school right now, and we're friends, wouldn't you agree? When we aren't on campus, you don't need to call me Dr. Miller."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>"So tell me what's going on, then. Be honest."</p>
<p>"I'm not sure I should tell you. I suppose there are some legal sides to it, but that's really really minor in the grand scheme. It's heavy stuff. You will probably want to throw me out of here if I tell you and I really don't want that."</p>
<p>"Try me. You may be surprised." Dr. Miller took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>Fuck it. I needed to tell someone, I guess. "I fell in love with someone I shouldn't have. She's completely amazing. But the consequences of being with her have caught up with me."</p>
<p>I motioned to my face and lifted my shirt so that he could see the large discolored bruises along my rib cage. You could actually make out a shoe print in one of them.</p>
<p>"My father did this to me. I haven't seen him since then. I probably deserved it. I've been disowned and I don't know where my sister is. I love her. We've been sleeping together for quite some time. We overslept night before last and were caught. Fucking stupid mistake to make."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know. I'm fucked up in the head."</p>
<p>"I didn't say that." Dr. Miller replied. "How long was this going on before your father found out?"</p>
<p>"Almost a year, I guess. Maybe longer."</p>
<p>"Hmm... Okay." He slapped his hand on the table. "Becky, my wife, is on her way up here with some food. I called her when I found you asleep in here. We need to get you fed and cleaned up. But here is what I am thinking."</p>
<p>He paused to drink "I'll get her to stop by the house this afternoon and grab some blankets and a couple of pillows for you. You can stay here in the studio for a while. Until you get your feet under you, at least. There's a fridge, a stove, the bathroom. It's not really meant to be lived in, but it will do for now."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Jeff. This means a lot." I replied with genuine gratitude. I looked around the place a moment. I could make do.</p>
<p>"Do you think your family will allow me to go to your house and get some more of your things?"</p>
<p>"I have no idea. I don't know what will happen with them anymore. But, I have to talk to Amy."</p>
<p>"I highly doubt that will be a possibility right now." Dr. Miller gave me a look. "Besides, you are in no condition to talk to her anyway. You need to get your head together first. And, to be honest, you'd probably scare her to death if she saw what you look like right now."</p>
<p>I hung my head in resignation. He was probably right.</p>
<p>Dr. Miller refilled his coffee and leaned against the counter, looking me over.</p>
<p>"You aren't the first person to find themselves in this predicament, and you won't be the last. You'll get through it, and you'll find yourself a stronger person. I don't expect you'll believe that, though."</p>
<p>I definitely didn't feel very strong at the moment, and I wasn't very sure about getting through it, either. I nodded at him anyway, wishing it didn't hurt to breathe.</p>
<p>"This key is for a storage locker on Oak Avenue. The remainder of your possessions are stored there. Your father was going to throw it all out, but I persuaded him otherwise.</p>
<p>It would be foolish of me to think that your father and I could keep you two from contacting each other in some way. We both know that just isn't possible. But I beg you to take some time and consider just how much damage your reckless, irresponsible behavior has caused. We are both devastated by the selfish, vile choices you two have made. But we are the only ones who have knowledge of it. This could easily ruin both of your lives if people found out, and has already changed the two of you irreparably. Your relationship with each other and with us will never be the same again. Had your father chosen to go to the police, you would be in jail right now. I don't even want to think of the years of psychiatric counseling that you are both desperately in need of.</p>
<p>Deep down in your heart, you surely can see this. You are too smart of a person to not be able to see it.</p>
<p>I am begging you to be the stronger, responsible older brother that I know you can be, Adam. If you truly love her as much as you say that you do, please stay away from her. Give her a chance to heal and move on with her life. I know that you are both hurting right now. But you still have a chance to lead fulfilling lives, have careers, meet other people, eventually raise families of your own. Maybe, somewhere down the line, things will work out where you will be able to mend some of the fences with your father.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that you heal and find happiness. I hope and pray that you take my words to heart. Do the right thing, Adam."</p>
<p>I read the words on the page several times before dropping the letter on the desk. Dr. Miller looked me over as he set down another box of art supplies.</p>
<p>"I assume that wasn't a letter filled with forgiveness and begging you to come home?" He asked dryly.</p>
<p>"Nope. That was pretty much the exact opposite of what it was." I sighed bitterly, before getting to my feet and going to help him unload the rest of the supplies from his car.</p>
<p>He had contacted my mother and she'd asked him to deliver the letter and key to me. She told him that my father had taken a vacation from work and was currently taking Amy to visit some of his relatives in New York. I knew, in an vague way, that our father had a brother in New York and some other relatives, but I had never met any of them. Clearly, they were determined to put as much space between us as possible.</p>
<p>As much as I wanted to see Amy, I didn't have the slightest idea how to find them in New York. Maybe once they got back, I could sneak over while our parents were at work. But my mother's words nagged at my mind as I gingerly stacked canvases in the corner of the room. I wasn't sure what to do.</p>
<p>In my dream, I fought back. When the first hit connected with my nose, I took the blow. When the second hit me in the stomach, I did nothing. When he kicked for my ribs, I rolled. I yelled for Amy to get out of the house. Somehow, she was dressed now. She tries to argue with me. She's screaming at my father to stop. He grabs her elbow and flings her away from us, intent on getting to me. I tackle him. In that dream logic way, the fight is just over. I grab Amy and we leave. We sleep in my car near the park. I tell here that we'll be okay. I tell her that everything is fine. I wake up in the dark art studio alone.</p>
<p>It's only three in the morning. Fuck. I never slept anymore. And with dreams like that, who the hell would want to?</p>
<p>It had now been three weeks since we'd been discovered. I hadn't left the art studio at all except for food, even then only late at night when there were fewer people around. The idea of even engaging in small talk with people filled me with complete dread. Dr. Miller's wife, Becky, was a registered nurse. She checked up on me several times, monitoring the healing progress on my ribs. More than once, I caught her eyeing my supply of prescription painkillers, doing a mental count of how many she thought I should approximately have left. As devastated as I was, it had never occurred to me to purposely overdose myself on the pills.</p>
<p>I didn't want to be around people at all if I could avoid it. I flinched every time Becky would try to put a reassuring hand on my shoulder. Being touched by someone suddenly became a totally unwelcome sensation. I didn't know how to deal with it. Grief and stress do fucked up things to your mind, I guess. I certainly couldn't bring myself to go back to class. Anytime I got around any place that reminded me of Amy, I would be wracked with grief again. I wasn't sleeping, barely eating, and felt like someone had carved out a large chunk from the center of my chest. I went by my parents house a few times, always after dark, and the upstairs bedrooms were always dark. I never knocked, simply stood out at the street and watched the house for a few minutes. I saw no sign of Amy there on any of these visits.</p>
<p>My phone had been disconnected the day after I took up residence in the art studio. It had been a relatively simple affair sign up for a new cell phone plan under my own name, but I immediately discovered that Amy's phone had been disconnected as well. My facebook page and email accounts had several messages from friends asking where I was, why I hadn't been to class, and so on. I didn't want to reply. The idea of talking to anyone who knew me made me cringe. Checking Amy's facebook page revealed that she hadn't posted anything to it since before we'd been caught.</p>
<p>Facebook's message window popped up on my laptop screen as a message from a friend appeared and I remembered that I had my settings set to show people when I was online. Instead of replying, I went to settings and deactivated the account. Then I went to my email accounts and did the same. I felt a strange sense of relief at being cut off from the world. I shut down the laptop and paced the room a bit.</p>
<p>I still had pain in my chest, but it had started to ease up a bit. My face only showed minor discoloration from the bruises now, but was still really tender when I touched it.</p>
<p>I began thinking about ways to get away from here. Some kind of fresh start. Somewhere no one knew me and I could try to put myself back together. It didn't feel like that was possible here. I had too many memories here and all of them filled me with ache. I didn't have enough money to really move and have any sort of security. I considered the military for the first time in my life, and quickly realized that wasn't going to be the answer. After doing some research on the peace corps, which I was only vaguely familiar with, I decided that was not my answer either. By sheer coincidence, Dr. Miller offered me a solution that I had not seen coming just a few days later.</p>
<p>"I heard about a job opportunity that I think could be really good for you, if you wanted it." He began.</p>
<p>I was disinterestedly picking away at a bowl of pasta and glanced up at him.</p>
<p>"An artist friend of mine in Milos is looking for an assistant. Room and board is included. It would be a serious change of pace for you, and you could learn a lot of technique from him."</p>
<p>"Milos? Where is that?" I asked, trying to place the name but coming up empty. As long as it wasn't here, I was probably going to take it.</p>
<p>"It's an island off of the coast of Greece. Quite a beautiful place, I must say. I took my wife there to visit him a couple of years ago."</p>
<p>For the first time in a month, I felt a tinge of interest in something. This could certainly be the change I was looking for. Greece? Damn. That was farther than I'd ever traveled in my life. I didn't know a damned thing about Greece, either. In my head, I pictured that they ate a lot of lamb, for some reason. Other than some vague memories of Greek mythology stories from my childhood, I couldn't have told anyone more than five sentences about the place. Statues, of course. They had ancient statues.</p>
<p>"Room and board is included?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It isn't much of a salary, I should point out. But when you factor in room and board, it's more than sufficient."</p>
<p>"Is he an artist I'm familiar with?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Have you heard of Theron Cain?"</p>
<p>"He works in oils, doesn't he? Surrealist landscape artist? You have a book of his work in your office."</p>
<p>"That's the guy. Are you interested?"</p>
<p>I really had nothing to lose at this point. It could certainly help clear my head to get away from here for a while. I didn't know how to find Amy at the moment, although it was only a matter of time. What was worse is that I wasn't completely sure that I should. For her sake, not my own. I kept thinking about letter my mother had written. Would Amy have a better life if I wasn't in it? I know she wouldn't think so. At least not now. I didn't really care much what happened to myself at this point.</p>
<p>The following day, I rented another storage building in the same complex as the one my possessions were already stored in and transferred everything to the new space. I did not know how long the current one was rented for and it was the last bit of control that my parents had over me. Severing that tie, put me completely on my own. I also stored most of what I had brought with me when I moved into the art studio. The rest of my possessions fit into two bags. I spent the remainder of the week getting my passport photos taken, booking my flight, and selling my car. I didn't get that much for it because I was needing to sell it in a hurry, but the hell with it.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, a few hours before my flight, I took a cab to my parents street and made a very bored cab driver park a couple of doors down while I gave the place one final look. I watched my father exit the house and drive away. Summoning every bit of courage that I possessed, I got out of the cab and walked to the front door.</p>
<p>I looked down at the porch cement as I knocked, almost afraid of who would answer the door. But no one did. I knocked again, and got no answer. I heard no signs of movement in the house at all. It was empty. I took a few steps out onto the lawn and looked up at Amy's window. I couldn't see anything except the ceiling of her room. I looked at the door handle and saw that the locks were shiny and new. Of course he had changed the locks. My keys would be worthless. Feeling defeated, I returned to the cab and headed for the airport.</p>
<p>Nineteen hours and three planes later, I stepped off out of a tiny single engine plane near some town called Zefiria on the island of Milos. I walked to baggage claim and waited for my luggage. The airport was not very large and it took only a few minutes. As soon as I picked up my bags, I turned to see a fairly attractive. short brunette woman, who looked to be in her late thirties to early forties smiling up at me.</p>
<p>"Adam Matheson?" She said in a thick British accent.</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am." I replied, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"I'm Margaret Cain. Theron asked me to pick you up."</p>
<p>"Ah! Nice to meet you." I extended my hand. She shook it firmly with a surprisingly tight grip.</p>
<p>"Welcome to Greece. Was it a nice flight?"</p>
<p>"It was long. Especially the Newark to Athens flight. But I'm glad for a change of scenery." I took on my recently adopted fake persona of a person who felt like they still had a reason to breathe.</p>
<p>"I imagine it was. But hopefully you will like it here. We'll meet up with Theron in Klima for lunch and get you settled in." She led me out to her car.</p>
<p>I had read up a little bit on Milos before leaving the States and was surprised that the entire population of the island was less than five thousand people. Then again, the whole island was only about 14 miles across. The photographs I had seen did not even begin to do the place justice. It was breathtaking. For the first time in a long while, I felt something almost like optimism. This was a far cry from home. The rock formations that lined some of the beaches were astonishingly beautiful. White and gray monoliths, carved away by the waves, jutting up proudly from the earth like bones of giant, long extinct creatures of old. Amy would love this place.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Theron was already at the small cafe near the beach when we arrived. He was a thin man who looked to be in his mid-forties, dressed in a simple t-shirt, shorts, and sandals. He stood up to greet me in an accent every bit as thick as Margaret's.</p>
<p>"Adam? Pleasure to meet you, sir. I am excited to work with you. Please, sit." He gestured to the table.</p>
<p>"Thanks." I sat down and found myself slightly taken aback by his pleasantness. A waiter brought a cup of coffee and took my order.</p>
<p>"I saw you once before at an art show at the university, but didn't get a chance to speak with you. I didn't know then that our paths would cross like this, or I would have been sure to introduce myself." He continued.</p>
<p>"Oh really? I'm sorry, but I don't remember seeing you there. No offense." I was surprised.</p>
<p>"It's quite all right, I was there early for only a few minutes and left soon after. But your work was a big part of why I was there."</p>
<p>"Mine?" I replied in genuine surprise. I had been looking around at the architecture of the buildings that surrounded us, but now he had my full attention.</p>
<p>"Jeff has spoken highly of you, Adam. He insisted that I should see your work and I happened to be in town for business at the time of the show. I came by and saw the ones you had displayed. I was quite impressed. I even bought one of your pieces, you'll see back at my studio."</p>
<p>"Wow. Thank you so much." I didn't know what else to say. A famous, successful artist had actually liked one of my paintings enough to buy it. I was blown away.</p>
<p>"Which painting, may I ask?" I was really curious now.</p>
<p>"I believe it was titled 'Judgment'. A haunting black and white piece. It resonated with me on a deep level, although I only recently came to figure out why that might be." He gave me a careful look.</p>
<p>My initial excitement had faded visibly and he had seen it happen.</p>
<p>"You aren't a fan of the piece, I take it?"</p>
<p>"I almost didn't put it in the show. I don't like that one at all."</p>
<p>"Because you had a lot of emotion tied up in it, no doubt." He wasn't asking.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I was in a dark frame of mind when I painted that one. Bad memories." I fought to stay composed. The guilt and uncertainty of that night didn't hold a candle to the shit I felt now.</p>
<p>"Guilt. Shame. Fear. You can see it all in the design. It's a powerful piece, once you have most of the puzzle pieces in place to know what you are seeing."</p>
<p>"You took all that from that painting?" I felt really raw and exposed.</p>
<p>"I didn't at first. I just knew it resonated. Once Jeff told me about your relationship with your sister, it all made sense. It made me even more glad that I bought the piece. It will remain in my collection forever." He said as he watched me pale in shock. Margaret gave us both a small smile and stared thoughtfully at her salad.</p>
<p>"Dr. Miller told you about that?"</p>
<p>"You can relax, Adam. Your secret is safe."</p>
<p>I looked up at him, still in shock. Margaret reached over and took his hand on top of the table.</p>
<p>"Theron here is my brother." Margaret spoke up, smiling as she kissed the back of his hand. "And I've loved him since I was a small child."</p>
<p>"We have been together since we were in college ourselves. We fought it for a long time, but resisting our feelings for each other became too much to bear. Before finally accepting the love we felt for each other, Margaret was nearly suicidal, and I was on a self destructive path of a different variety. So we know very well how you feel."</p>
<p>"Holy shit." I leaned back in my chair.</p>
<p>"Sorry!" I added hastily, realizing I had cursed in front of my new employer.</p>
<p>"Don't be." He laughed. Margaret started snickering as well. "But you can see why Jeff thought you would benefit from working with me. Both for your art and your life. And hopefully you can understand why I might be able to recognize the pain you felt when you painted 'Judgment'."</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Jeff told us what happened with you. I'm sorry you experienced such harsh rejection by your family. Our own situation was much different. We were orphaned when our parents died in a plane crash many years ago. They never knew about us. Our extended families were another matter entirely." Margaret spoke up, giving my arm a sympathetic squeeze.</p>
<p>I fought to keep my tears in check. I had known these people less than an hour and already found myself with all of my cards on the table. I was a raw, broken, shell of a person with nothing more to hide.</p>
<p>"Hopefully, you can find some comfort and happiness here with us. We want to help you however we can. And I meant it when I said I was a fan of your work. I really am looking forward to working with you." Theron sounded sincere.</p>
<p>"I can't believe this. This whole situation." I looked out at the beach, taking in the beautiful blue water. It seemed impossibly blue.</p>
<p>"It's a lot to take in." Theron agreed. "When Jeff called me, I knew I had to try to help. It's not often that you meet someone who's gone through a situation as unusual as ours."</p>
<p>"I imagine not." I chuckled for the first time in weeks. "I can't believe you are fan of my stuff."</p>
<p>"Why not? You have talent, Adam. You aren't well known to the art world yet, but that will change with time." He sounded certain when he said it, as if it were a fact and not a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Theron led me through a large work space. The walls and ceiling were stone, making me ponder how old this place was. Large windows allowed natural light to flow through the room. Huge canvases, some as much as fifteen feet long, leaned against the walls. I had never painted on a surface that large and couldn't imagine how long it must take to paint something at that scale. He motioned to a short corridor the was set in one back wall. He hit a light switch and set one of my bags on by the doorway. I walked into the room and looked around. For a room made out of stone, the place looked rather comfortable. The walls were stone, painted white, and the only wood in the place was the furniture and door frames. There was a bed in a back corner, with an end table next to it. A work bench, book case, and closet made up the back wall. A small round table with two chairs was set in the center of the room. A simple and beautiful hand made vase was centered on the table.</p>
<p>"It's not much, but I think you'll find it comfortable." Theron said. "Feel free to repaint the place if you don't care for the color. This was the color that the house came with."</p>
<p>"I don't need a lot, really." I replied.</p>
<p>"There is a small kitchen over through this doorway here. And a bathroom through that door over by the corner. I'm afraid there's not a television out here, but we can take care of that soon." He continued.</p>
<p>"I can watch plenty of stuff on my laptop, there's really not a need for a TV. I don't really plan on watching much television anyway."</p>
<p>"Whatever you prefer is fine. If you decide you'd like a television out here eventually, we will be happy to help you with that. We would have set you up in the main house, but thought you might prefer the privacy that being out by the studio can provide."</p>
<p>"This is great, Theron. This is much better than I was anticipating. The way Jeff talked,, I expected that it would just be a bed in a corner and maybe a closet." I responded.</p>
<p>Theron nodded in response, but seemed pleased.</p>
<p>"I'll leave you to get settled in for a while then. I'm sure you are worn out from the flight and all." He turned and headed for the door, then paused. "Listen, I know you have been through a lot lately. If you ever want to talk about it, I'll be glad to listen. I imagine given the peculiar circumstances you have dealt with, there haven't been many people you can talk to about it."</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>"Alright then. There's not much in your fridge out here right now, but Margaret will take you into town tomorrow to get you stocked up. When you are ready for dinner, come up to the main house and we'll go get something. I'm afraid neither of us are very good cooks. Especially when compared to the local cuisine."</p>
<p>With that, Theron left me in my new home. I sat at the small round table, pulled out my laptop and connected to the internet using the WiFi password Theron had given me. I checked Amy's facebook page and saw, as before, that nothing had been updated on it in weeks. I closed the laptop and sighed. There really wasn't much more I could do right now. Was it a mistake to come here? I couldn't stay back in Austin, I was going crazy there. I folded my arms, and put my head down. Too late now, either way.</p>
<p>The rocks felt insanely hot against the backs of my legs. I couldn't tell for sure, but it seemed like I was at least eighty or a hundred feet up. I had spent the last half hour climbing up the side of the rock formation overlooking the bay. The crystal clear, blue water below looked warm and inviting. The base of the rock outcropping to my right looked was what had originally commanded my attention, however.</p>
<p>I stood up, taking in the smell of the breeze blowing in across the water, and looked to the right. I felt hollow as I stared down at the rocks below that were so white that they looked like they were glowing. I felt a strange sense of relief at the thought of taking the jump. I chuckled bitterly at the idea that I'd leave behind one final painting of deep red on the white rocks below if I did it. Man, I have a fucked up sense of humor sometimes. I sighed heavily.</p>
<p>Is this really the kind of person I am? I kept asking myself this question. Ever since I had discovered this particular rock formation a couple of weeks before, it had continued to draw me back to it. The idea of feeling nothing felt so much better than feeling the hollowness that continued to plague me. Coming here hadn't solved that hollow feeling as I had hoped. I had always considered the idea of doing something like this to be cowardly, to be letting whatever you were facing win. But here I was, debating with myself whether or not I was the kind of person who would take the selfish route to relief. I was out of tears by now, and just felt drained and empty.</p>
<p>Here I was, sitting in one of the most beautiful places I had ever seen, feeling just about as lost as I ever had in my life. Not today, I finally thought to myself, I'm being irrational about this again. I turned back to the left over the water. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement. I glanced over and saw Margaret's small shape sitting on a boulder far below, about twenty yards away. She was watching me with what looked like a worried expression. It was hard to tell from this distance. Her small hand came up to wave at me. I waved back.</p>
<p>I stepped back a couple of yards then ran toward the cliff edge, launching myself out over the water as I'd done at least a dozen times since my arrival. There was that brief moment of panic, worrying that I hadn't kicked off the cliff side hard enough. Then came the all too brief half second feeling of weightlessness, followed by the rush of wind, just before the splash. I felt the warm water wash over me, air bubbles churned noisily all around me. I gathered my bearings, and propelled myself through the water in long strokes toward the surface. I broke through the water and felt the hot sun on my face, as I took a deep breath. I made my way to the shore a few moments later to find Margaret standing there with a towel in her hand.</p>
<p>"I know you don't believe it now, but it gets better Adam." She said sadly, handing me the towel.</p>
<p>"If you say so." I replied, wiping my face with the towel.</p>
<p>"I didn't believe it when people tried to tell me that, either. I don't blame you for doubting me. But I'm glad you decided to stick around a while longer. We love having you here." She commented, trying to hide the concern in her voice. She put a hand up to my shoulder and gripped it just a little. An attempt to be reassuring, I guess.</p>
<p>"Thanks. It just overwhelms me sometimes." I sighed. "I start thinking stupid thoughts. I know it's not rational, at least. It's easier to ignore when I realize that."</p>
<p>"I know. Recognizing it is the real turning point." Margaret nodded.</p>
<p>"I can't do it if you're watching me, anyway. I'd feel too guilty for making someone watch that happen." I stared back at the pile of rock.</p>
<p>"That's the idea." She gave me a soft smile.</p>
<p>"That's playing dirty, lady." I gave her a tiny smirk.</p>
<p>"Yep. I can tell you have a kind heart. Under the circumstances, I'm willing to exploit it. And I'm not sorry, either. Do you want to eat something? We can go get some dinner if you like?" She asked.</p>
<p>"I'll pass. But thank you. I'm just not really hungry right now." I replied as I looked back up at the cliff. I didn't know then that it was the last time I'd climb that particular group of rocks.</p>
<p>Margaret was right, it did eventually get better.</p>
<p>The next few months went by quickly. I found that I quickly became good friends with Theron and Margaret, despite them being almost twice my age. Theron worked on with very large canvases, often more than twelve feet across and had me help him stretch the canvas material over the frames to set them. He also kept me busy with sawing and sanding wood to use for the canvas frames. None of this seemed to be anything he couldn't handle himself, and I suspected that he had me doing it more to keep my mind occupied than because he actually needed the help. The busyness helped ease my depression.</p>
<p>I learned that Margaret was heavily involved in pottery, which explained her deceptively strong hands. She taught me to throw clay and use the pottery wheels. I found the process tiring and tedious, but was still fascinated with the end results. My attempts to make relatively simple things like bowls and cups were generally agreed upon by both of the Cains as dismal failures. Out of sheer stubbornness, I used one of my lopsided bowls for paint mixing, until I accidentally dropped it one afternoon, effectively ending my fledgling career as a potter.</p>
<p>Theron enjoyed fishing and paddling his small boat out around the island. Eventually, he got me to go fishing with him. I found it surprisingly enjoyable. He laughed when I asked about sharks and explained that there weren't many to be found around the island and that he'd never even heard of an attack in the area. I quickly discovered the caves along the water's edge and spent a lot of time swimming in the tide pools inside them. I loved the quiet solitude of the place, and often walked the beaches at night.</p>
<p>Theron and Margaret were both very interested in how my relationship with Amy had started and asked lots of questions about her. I showed them the drawing that I had done of her the night she fell asleep on the sofa and agreed that it was the most realistic drawing that they had ever seen me produce. I missed her constantly.</p>
<p>By the end of the fourth month, I found myself standing in front of a large, blank canvas for the first time in what felt like ages. I was positioned by an open window with the fresh salt air blowing in from the bay. Theron was across the room working on a canvas of his own. I put on my headphones, after several weeks of not listening to any music at all, and called up the first song that came to mind. One that reminded me of Amy. It was a song that I had loaded on her phone the day before she left for Rome, and it was a favorite of mine. Radiohead's "All I Need" started playing on repeat as I picked up a tube of paint and set to work.</p>
<p>For a few minutes, I stood with the brush full of paint just sitting in my hand next to the canvas. Finally, I just dropped the brush in the rinse water and squirted crimson paint into my palm. I began smearing it on the canvas, creating vine-like curves across the length of it. I added more crimson and yellow to my palm and kept working the image. It was like trying to finger paint as an adult. There wasn't as much control. But the raw image felt more visceral to me for some reason. As it began coming together, I worked faster. I became enthralled in the work and lost myself in it.</p>
<p>When I finished coating the entire canvas in paint, I grabbed a rag, wet it, and began wiping away sections of the acrylic paint in a circular pattern, being sure to leave some of the image intact, creating an effect of round objects that were lighter in color than the rest. I grabbed my bottle of water and splashed some on the canvas. Then I cupped my hand and put a small amount of white paint in it, adding water and creating a milky thin wash. I splashed that across the canvas as well. The resulting look of the image was somewhat like it was cloudy and melting. Finally, I grabbed a brush and began working on details in crimson. The raw, hand painted background adding a new dimension to the design in a way I hadn't done before. Hours later, I leaned back against a bar stool and looked over the finished design.</p>
<p>"Damn." Theron spoke up, startling me. I looked over to see he and Margaret sitting on the stone steps behind me that lead up to the dining area of the studio, watching me.</p>
<p>"That was fun to watch," Margaret said, smiling. "Are you finished with it?"</p>
<p>"I think so." I said, somewhat embarrassed to be observed like that. Amy was the only person who had ever really watched me paint outside of a classroom before.</p>
<p>"I think you are, too." Theron said. "Most impressive. I love it."</p>
<p>I washed up my brushes and cleaned the paint off of my hands. I felt a sense of accomplishment for the first time in a long while. Another of the clouds over my spirits seemed to fade away a little.</p>
<p>It was late afternoon and I was famished. We all went out to eat at the cafe in Klima again, and I went to the beach while they returned home. I sat atop a large rock formation and looked out at the beautiful clear blue water as the sun disappeared for the night. I didn't feel at peace, but I felt as close I thought I probably ever would. I missed Amy with everything that was in me, but I felt like maybe I was giving her the chance that my mother so desperately wanted for her to have a normal life. I wondered what she was doing now. I wished she were here with me. This view would have blown her away. I wished to take her down to one of the tide pools inside the caves and make love to her there with the only light shining up from where the outside sun would shine through the pool. The familiar knot tightened in my stomach and I wept silently in the dark.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, I went down to the studio and looked over the painting I had done the day before. I was pleased with the results and placed it against the wall. I grabbed a fresh canvas, picked a song, and went to work on it. By evening, I'd completed another. I became prolific. My color choices became brighter than I normally used, not because I was in a better mood, but because I didn't want to use the typical earth tones that tended to be my routine color choices. I also began to work on a larger scale, the largest of them being one that measured six feet across. That one had overdone it and I settled into a more comfortable two feet by four feet format for most of them.</p>
<p>A few more months passed and I participated in a couple of small local shows around Greece. I even had a couple of paintings on display in one of the larger galleries in Athens. I began to make a small amount of money, nothing even close to enough to live on, but at least I was generating some income from my paintings. Still, I couldn't help admitting that I was achieving a tiny amount of success as an artist, which was something I could never have fathomed happening. Much like the rest of my pay since arriving here, I simply put the money in savings and more or less forgot about it.</p>
<p>One afternoon, after delivering a new painting of Theron's for display at a large gallery in Athens, I walked a couple of blocks down the street to grab some lunch at a small cafe. Not knowing my way around Greek cuisine very well, I blindly ordered the youvetsi from the menu. It arrived shortly after and was edible, but not something I would typically order for myself. I sat at a curbside table under a large umbrella, picking at it disinterestedly and watching traffic pass by.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>I was lost in my thoughts for a while, thinking how much Amy would love to check out the architecture around here, when I heard a feminine voice speaking to me. Her Greek accent was thick, but her English was flawless.</p>
<p>"It's not their best dish, is it?"</p>
<p>I looked up to see a very attractive, tall, slender woman with olive skin and green eyes smiling down at me. She had long, dark hair pulled back in a light ponytail and was dressed in an elegant black dress with a small black purse in her hand.</p>
<p>"It's fine, really. I'm just not that hungry." I replied.</p>
<p>"Do you mind if I join you?" She asked, politely. I couldn't think of a polite way to decline her on a moment's notice, so I gave her a small smile and motioned her to a chair.</p>
<p>"Thank you. I get tired of eating alone at lunch every day." She smiled again. "You don't recognize me, do you?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I don't." I was now puzzled. Did I know her from somewhere?</p>
<p>"I'm Natali. I work at the gallery."</p>
<p>"Oh, right! I'm sorry, I should have remembered." I pondered if I had ever seen her there. I never paid much attention to the people there. I think I vaguely recalled seeing a tall, dark haired woman around.</p>
<p>"How do you like working for Mr. Cain?"</p>
<p>A waiter came up and she ordered moussaka without so much as a glance at the menu.</p>
<p>"It's a good job. Keeps me busy, but still allows me time to work on my own paintings. He and his wife are good people."</p>
<p>"They seem to be." She agreed.</p>
<p>After a few moments of silence, Natali asked, "So what brought you here from America?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. A fresh start somewhere new. I wanted something different." I shrugged.</p>
<p>"Somewhere new? You are in one of the oldest cities in the world!" She laughed brightly. It took me a moment to realize she was making a joke.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well. It's not Austin, so it's good enough for my purpose."</p>
<p>"Austin? Texas?" She asked, her green eyes seemed to stare through me. It made me uncomfortable, even though she was polite and friendly.</p>
<p>"Yeah." I replied as I picked at my pasta. It was the sauce, I decided, that made the dish unappetizing.</p>
<p>"You don't look like what I picture an American from Texas to look like." Smiling at me again.</p>
<p>"I left my chaps and spurs in the States." I quipped.</p>
<p>She looked me over for a moment, a couple of wrinkles appearing between her eyebrows. Then one of her eyebrows cocked to a high point.</p>
<p>"You are joking with me." She decided aloud. I couldn't help chuckling.</p>
<p>"Ah, you are!" She exclaimed, delighted. "You should smile more. You have a nice smile."</p>
<p>She put a hand gently on my forearm, and it finally dawned on me that she was flirting.</p>
<p>"Thanks." I picked at my food some more, scraping the offending sauce away.</p>
<p>"You really don't like that very much, do you?"</p>
<p>"Not really," I admitted. "I'm not used to the food here, yet. Still trying different dishes."</p>
<p>"Would would you eat if you could have anything?"</p>
<p>"That's easy. Egg rolls. Hot and sour soup. Some good lo mien." I replied.</p>
<p>"I know a place. If you'd like to meet me for dinner?" Her eyes met mine expectantly.</p>
<p>I looked back down at my plate, trying to think of how I could turn her down without hurting her feelings. The obvious answer occurred to me a half second later.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I've got to head back in a couple of hours."</p>
<p>"Oh. That's too bad. Maybe another time." She briefly looked down, her smile faltered a little. But it returned almost immediately.</p>
<p>"Maybe so. When I don't have to get back to the island so soon." I lied, aiming for politeness.</p>
<p>"Sounds good to me." She replied, brightly.</p>
<p>We finished our meal, or more accurately, she finished her meal as I picked at mine in disdain and paid for our bills separately. I turned to wave goodbye to her and instead was met with a brief hug. She gave me her business card with a home number written on the back and walked back toward the gallery.</p>
<p>She seemed like a nice girl and was certainly beautiful, I thought. But the idea of getting involved with anyone just made my stomach churn. There was only one person I wanted to be with. I flipped the card over in my hand and read over it.</p>
<p>"Natali Panagakos," Her name was followed by some Greek lettering that I assumed meant sales representative or something similar. The only other thing I could read on the card were the words "fine arts." Fair enough, I shrugged. I slipped the card in my back pocket and walked back to the ferry.</p>
<p>Back on Milos, I told the Cains about the encounter over dinner. They both listened with great interest. Margaret was, of course, completely amused at my obliviousness to having been hit on by a girl until she had touched me.</p>
<p>"I know her family," Theron observed. "They are nice people. You could certainly do worse if you decided to pursue her."</p>
<p>"I'm not going to pursue her. That wouldn't do anyone any good, I don't think." I replied, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"I understand." He replied as he exchanged a slight glance with Margaret, who shrugged. I didn't know what that meant and I didn't ask.</p>
<p>I was pretty sure that I was better off alone at this point. The relationship I'd had with Amy was irreplaceable. There wasn't any reason to bother with anyone else as far as I was concerned.</p>
<p>Eventually, November rolled around and I realized for the first time that I had a pretty decent idea of where I could find Amy. She would likely be in Colorado for the week, as called for by family tradition. I pulled out my laptop and priced flights to the US. I chose a flight and sat with my credit card in my hand, about to put in the information to buy the ticket when I froze up. I must have lingered there for ten minutes, indecisive. What would I even say at this point? How could I approach the entire family that way? It's not like I could just knock on their door, walk in, hug everyone except my parents, and sweep Amy up in my arms. What if she didn't want me anymore? The very idea sounded absurd. I closed the laptop and went for a walk.</p>
<p>The afternoon of Thanksgiving Day, which meant nothing other than Thursday in Greece, I sat at my kitchen counter staring at my phone for a few long minutes. I finally picked it up and called Aunt Linda's place. On the fourth ring, someone picked up. I could hear the jovial atmosphere in the background. I swallowed hard at the sound of Aunt Linda's voice.</p>
<p>"Hello?"</p>
<p>"Happy Thanksgiving, Aunt Linda."</p>
<p>"Oh my god, is this Adam?!" She exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is. I'm sorry I couldn't be there this year. I miss you guys." I tried to sound better than I felt.</p>
<p>"I'm so glad you called. We miss you, too! Holly! Holly, it's Adam." I heard Aunt Linda call to my mother. Shit, I thought to myself.</p>
<p>"Aunt Linda!" I tried not to shout, trying to get her attention back.</p>
<p>"Yes?" She sounded puzzled by my desperation.</p>
<p>"Is Amy there?"</p>
<p>"No, she's not, Adam. She stayed in California for the break. You didn't know that?" Now she definitely sounded confused. My heart sank. California? How the hell was I supposed to find her there?</p>
<p>"Okay, thanks. Send everyone my love." I replied.</p>
<p>"Don't you want to say hello to your mother? She's right he-" I hung up before I had to face that conversation.</p>
<p>I slumped at the counter and stared at the wall for a long while.</p>
<p>When I left the United States, I had originally expected to be gone for just a few months at most. I had now been in Greece for three years. I had come to really enjoy living there and the idea of returning to the States filled me with a sense of dread. At one point I looked into renting a house near Theron and Margaret's home, but they were adamant that I continue living in the small apartment built off of Theron's studio. I felt that I was about as comfortable as I could ever expect to be, and although the gaping hole in my life that Amy had once occupied was still there, it had diminished somewhat. I can't say that she was ever far from my thoughts.</p>
<p>Over time, Natali's gentle persistence eventually wore me down and we went out on a date during one of my visits to the mainland. Before the date even started, I knew that it was a mistake. I carefully explained to her that I was just not in a place emotionally where I could handle being in a relationship with someone. I made sure that she understood it wasn't about her and that I thought she was a great person. She claimed to understand and, after a slightly awkward couple of weeks, we settled into a comfortable friendship. I had worried that she was holding out hope for me to eventually want to be with her, but she began dating another guy soon after and I relaxed.</p>
<p>She was a fan of my work and showed some of my pieces to a friend who worked at a gallery in Rome. Before long, I had pieces showing in a gallery there, as well. When I traveled to Rome to deliver the pieces, I stayed at the Palazzo, the same hotel Amy had stayed at when she was in Rome several years before. I pulled out my phone in the hotel room and looked through the pictures she had sent me from that very hotel. As silly as it seemed, even to me, I wondered if I was staying the the same room that she had. I sat on the balcony that night, listening to Swans' "Love of Life" album, and wished she were with me.</p>
<p>A few months later, I was in my biggest gallery show yet. This time in London. Theron had a big show there and had pulled strings with the gallery owner to be sure that I was included in the show. Theron gave me a thirty foot section of wall space near the entrance to his gallery and ensured that my name and art was included on the promotional materials for the gallery opening. As I selected pieces for the show, I joked that I felt like the opening act for a concert. He commented that it was a good comparison.</p>
<p>Theron and Margaret both found my thought process surrounding the pricing of my work for the show to be hysterically funny. Every time I would jot down a price on the list, Theron would come behind me and scratch through it, writing in absurdly ridiculous amounts instead.</p>
<p>"Oh, fuck off Theron! No one is ever going to pay 18,000 quid for that. I painted it in three hours.. I practically pissed on the canvas!" I exclaimed, trying to write the price back in at two thousand. Honestly, I still felt I was ripping people off asking two thousand for it.</p>
<p>"This isn't those piss ant little college shows you used to do. This is a real show at a serious gallery. They don't know you did that in three hours. And so what if you did? Eighteen thousand is a bargain for that painting. I think you should price it at twenty five thousand quid, myself!" Theron barked back at me.</p>
<p>"You have got to be kidding me. I don't know if you've been drinking the salt water out there or what, but you are out of your goddamned mind." I shook my head at him in frustration. Margaret just cackled at our bickering.</p>
<p>"I should be taping this." She remarked at one point, earning looks of exasperation from both of us.</p>
<p>They finally bullied me into agreeing to their pricing plan, arguing that they had years of experience in the art world and that I didn't understand the value of my work. By the time it was all said and done, I had set a total value of my paintings to be featured in the show at a little over 340,000 Euro. I found that number staggering to contemplate.</p>
<p>The three of us flew to London together the week of the show and they were both further amused by my excitement about seeing England for the first time. They had both grown up there, and found the place to be rather dull.</p>
<p>The night of the opening, I was dressed in a suit and tie. It was not my idea, but Margaret had insisted. The gallery was packed with people and I was slightly thrilled to see the degree of interest in my work. Theron introduced me to a couple of other very well known artists that were friends of his and I felt I did a fairly good job of hiding my sense of awe at meeting some of them. I was surprised to find that a couple of them shared my generally cynical view of the art world. But what really unnerved me was the realization that some of the art critics that attended the opening were looking over my work and taking notes.</p>
<p>I don't think it had hit me until that moment that my work would be viewed by serious, world renowned art critics this evening. Theron was off working the crowd, greeting some fans, and so on. Margaret noticed the look on my face and brought me a glass of wine. She assured me that it was going well so far and that I didn't need to be concerned about the critics. I drained the wine in about thirty seconds and a server handed me a replacement.</p>
<p>An older British woman approached us and claimed to be a fan of my work. I tried to be gracious about it, but was again very uncomfortable with the idea that I actually had fans. It turned out that this woman had purchased one of my paintings at a previous show in Athens and had actually come to this show to see my work, not Theron's. Margaret flashed me a huge smile when she overheard that and nodded at me as if to say she had told me so. The woman gave me an email address and asked that I send her photos of any new pieces I would consider selling that were not currently on display. I assured her that I would and she went on her way. I didn't find out until later that it was considered extremely rude by most serious artists and galleries for a buyer to request to see work that was not currently on display. I didn't see a problem with it, myself.</p>
<p>About an hour after the show started, I was able to ignore the critics milling about and began to get bored. Truthfully, I was surprised I lasted that long. I normally lost patience with these things in the first twenty minutes. I sipped a glass of wine, wishing it was a beer, and was chatting with Margaret when I heard a soft voice behind me that made my heart seize up.</p>
<p>"Your new work is beautiful, Adam."</p>
<p>I turned and saw Amy standing before me, a shy and hesitant smile on her face. Her eyes were tired but warm and beautiful. She was dressed in a tight, dark blue dress that ended a few inches above her knees with matching heels. The sapphire necklace that I had given her for Christmas years before dangled from her gorgeous neck. Her hair, now longer, was hanging loosely over one shoulder, exposing her neck fully on one side. She didn't look a day older than when I'd last saw her, over three years before. She took my goddamned breath away.</p>
<p>I opened my mouth to speak, and words wouldn't form. I just stared at her for a long moment, just as she stared at me. My mind started racing through thoughts so quickly that I could hardly form them into words. Part of my mind was screaming at myself at the top of it's lungs to speak, while another was racing through questions. Did she resent me? She would have every right to. I left her behind. I fucking left her behind. Why the fuck did I do that? Did she still want me? Need me like I needed her? Speak, goddamn you! She's right here. Fucking speak! Has she moved on? Is she over me? She's here. She can't hate me. Right? Make your mouth work. Hug her. Hold her. Don't. You. Fucking. Cry.</p>
<p>"I wasn't sure I should come." She finally spoke, her lower lip trembling with uncertainty.</p>
<p>"I'm so glad you did." I replied, taking my first breath of air in what I thought may have been nearly a minute. In my mind, my words sounded distant, like I was on autopilot for a moment. I wasn't prepared for to see her. I had so much to say. I tried desperately to get my thoughts in order. Fuck! She was really here! I ached to hold her in my arms.</p>
<p>"So it's okay that I'm here?" Her voice cracked a little, still hesitant. A storm of emotions was clearly visible in her beautiful blue eyes. I could only imagine the same could be seen in mine, assuming I didn't look as afraid as I felt. Afraid of her. Afraid of myself. Afraid she'd leave. Afraid of... everything.</p>
<p>"It's more than okay. I just can't believe that I'm seeing you." I stepped forward and hugged her, no longer able to control my impulse. The hell with my fears, I had to hold her. At least once.</p>
<p>Her arms wrapped around me in a tight embrace and she started shaking. Her wonderful, familiar scent filled my lungs. My body had missed her on a cellular level, as I felt rocked to my very core by the warm softness of her small frame encased in mine. Every fiber of my being was focused on holding her in my arms again. I felt a tightness deep in my chest, a feeling I had possessed for so long that I no longer remembered it was not a part of me, slowly begin to uncoil.</p>
<p>We didn't speak for a few long moments, neither of us willing to release our grip on the other. We both seemed to physically vibrate with the power of the moment we were sharing.</p>
<p>"You were so fucking hard to find." She nearly whispered, her voice choking the words out. I could feel her tears dampening my shoulder.</p>
<p>"I've missed you so much." I breathed in her ear, my voice cracking around the knot in my throat. I tightened my arms around her in a squeeze for a moment but couldn't will myself to let go of her yet. A tear of my own slid down my face, despite my efforts to contain it.</p>
<p>Finally, she pulled away from me a few inches, her hands sliding down my arms to take both of my hands in hers. She smiled at me as warmly as ever, relief and elation written all over her face despite the tears that caused her mascara to bleed tiny black lines. Many of my questions fell away from my mind in that moment, no longer relevant as I looked in her eyes. They still shone with her love for me. As blue as the water back home.</p>
<p>I heard someone clear their throat suggestively nearby and glanced up to see Theron standing a few feet away with his arm around Margaret. They both had huge expectant grins painted on their faces. Hell, Margaret looked like she may start bouncing at any moment. Margaret wordlessly held a tissue out to Amy, who took accepted it and held it to each of her eyes.</p>
<p>Theron mouthed the word "Amy?" to me, although he looked certain that he already knew the answer. I nodded slightly, suddenly remembering where I was and that we were in a room full of people.</p>
<p>"You must be Amy." Theron said. Amy glanced at me with a puzzled expression, but nodded to him.</p>
<p>"This is Theron Cain and his wife, Margaret. This is Theron's show." I explained.</p>
<p>Theron extended his hand and Amy shook it politely, her other hand still holding mine.</p>
<p>Margaret leaned over and planted a kiss on Amy's cheek, motioning to me. "I can't tell you how important you are to this man. I'm so very glad to get the chance to meet you."</p>
<p>Amy didn't seem to mind Margaret's well meaning affection, despite her being a stranger and hugged herself to my arm, which was still trapped fiercely in her grip.</p>
<p>"He's everythi-" She started to speak and buried her face in my shoulder instead, shaking against me. I pulled my free arm up around her and held her close.</p>
<p>People were moving through the gallery, blissfully unaware of us and the tremendous importance of our reunion. We weren't being stared at, but I wanted to be alone with Amy all the same. I didn't care about the show at all anymore. My little sister was back in my arms and that was the only thing that mattered to me right now. I looked up at Theron, who nodded at me as if reading my mind.</p>
<p>"Get out of here, man. I'll call you in the morning and tell you how the rest of the show went. You've got more important things to take care of." He smiled at me, and put his arm around Margaret again.</p>
<p>Margaret's eyes were shimmering like she was going to start crying at any moment as she smiled more widely than I would have guessed she was capable of.</p>
<p>"Thanks." I acknowledged, and led Amy out of the gallery to the street. Her arm was still wrapped around me as we walked. I wasn't going to complain.</p>
<p>I started to hail a cab, but decided to walk for a while instead.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"Do you need to sit somewhere?" I asked her. She shook her head, letting out a little gasp as she tried to recompose herself.</p>
<p>We walked alongside the gallery building in silence for a few moments, without a destination in mind. I tried to organize my thoughts, not wanting to terrify her with a mountain of questions and declarations. She seemed to be calming down and I thought she was probably trying to do the same. We passed a well tended pavilion that was positioned next to the gallery and came across a Starbuck's.</p>
<p>I walked toward the entrance and Amy, seeing the building, broke her silence.</p>
<p>"You always hated Starbuck's. You said they were a cult and were going to slip potassium in the coffee at any moment and take out half the world's population."</p>
<p>"I still do. And I stand by my theory." I replied, grinning a little at the memory. "But you used to love the stuff."</p>
<p>"Let's find somewhere else." She said, sliding her hand down my arm to interlace our fingers. I suspected her arm was tiring from the grip she'd had on mine for so long now. I know my arm was grateful for a little respite, but I would have died before I voiced a complaint.</p>
<p>We kept wandering down the block and I suddenly had a silly urge to state the obvious.</p>
<p>"We're walking the streets of London together. Who would have thought that would happen?" I asked.</p>
<p>She stopped walking and gripped my hand a little tighter signaling to do the same. I turned to face her as she moved in closer to me. Smiling up at me, she said "I'd always hoped to."</p>
<p>I got lost in her smile for a moment and, impulsively, I kissed her. Her lips met mine and parted immediately. Our tongues gently explored each others' mouths, remembering their favorite places. It wasn't a hungry, driven kiss. It was a passionate, loving kiss. I felt years of tension and longing falling away from me. If anything had ever felt more right to me in my life than this moment, I didn't know what it would be. My free hand came up and wrapped around the side of her neck, my thumb resting just beneath her ear. She purred contentedly against me, letting out a relieved sounding sigh.</p>
<p>"Was that okay?" I asked, hesitantly, when our lips parted. I didn't know where we stood, really. I didn't know if she had someone else in her life, now. It had been years, after all, and I'd acted on impulse, kissing her almost instinctively. She hadn't acted like it was a bad move, but... Christ, I was thinking too much again.</p>
<p>"Oh god, yes. Do it again." She exclaimed and moved her lips back to mine. We kissed again, deeper this time, a little hungrier. She whimpered into my mouth, a satisfied sound that told me that she felt this was as right as I did.</p>
<p>We were interrupted when my arm was struck by a woman with an armload of shopping bags as she passed us and I suddenly remembered we were standing on a relatively busy sidewalk.</p>
<p>"Sorry, excuse me." The woman said over her shoulder.</p>
<p>"We're gonna get run over if we keep standing like this," I muttered and we resumed our walk.</p>
<p>Amy took the lead now, and it took me a moment to realize where she was leading us. There was a diner up ahead that had booths lining the walls and didn't look extremely packed at the moment. I held open the door for her and followed her inside.</p>
<p>Once we were settled into a booth and I finally had both hands free for a moment, I reached up and loosened my tie. As I slid it into the pocket of my suit jacket, Amy shot me a look.</p>
<p>"Why'd you do that?" She asked.</p>
<p>"It was uncomfortable," I replied as I unbuttoned the top button of my dress shirt and felt a great sense of relief.</p>
<p>"You look good in a suit." Amy observed.</p>
<p>A waitress came and took our order. I didn't ask, but I think we both ordered more out of politeness and nervousness than anything. I certainly wasn't hungry. By the time our waitress headed for the kitchen, I felt I had put off the inevitable long enough. It was time to ask questions. I wasn't quite sure where to start.</p>
<p>"Are you vacationing here or..?" I ventured.</p>
<p>"Kind of. I guess. I came here looking for you." She smiled at the last bit, reaching across the table to take my hand.</p>
<p>"Wow. You heard about the show in Austin?" I didn't think it had been advertised that widely. I mean, I understood that it could be found online, but I hadn't thought it would so prominent as to be heard about in the States.</p>
<p>"Well, Portland, actually. I found an announcement for it online and saw your name."</p>
<p>"Jesus. And you came all the way here in case it was me, just from seeing my name?" I was a little surprised, even though I shouldn't have been. I would have gone farther, if I knew for sure she'd be there.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you did, don't get me wrong." I added defensively, as a tiny grin crept over her face. I wasn't exactly oozing confidence at the moment. In a perfect world, she might end up mocking me for this one day. How weird is it that I missed her making fun of me? Hell, I missed everything about her.</p>
<p>"This is incredible. You're really here. I really found you. We're together." The words nearly exploded from her as she broke into on of her most excited smiles that spread from ear to ear. "I almost can't believe it."</p>
<p>"Yeah" I chuckled, feeling slightly giddy as her words sunk in. "We're together. You really found me."</p>
<p>"I love you." I told her, feeling nearly as nervous as I had the first time I had said those words to her in a non-familial context.</p>
<p>Her long delicate fingers moved to intertwine with my own again. She looked up at me, her stunning blue eyes locked with mine. "I love you, too."</p>
<p>"So there's no one waiting for you back at the hotel? Or in Portland?" I asked, regretting my insecurity immediately.</p>
<p>"No, baby. There's no one but you. There could never be anyone else." She squeezed my hand, rubbing her thumb over mine.</p>
<p>"That's a relief," I sighed. "I mean, you let me kiss you and all, so I thought... I just... Fuck." I brought my other arm up on the table and buried my face in the crook of my elbow. This is my little sister, the love of my life. Why can't I just talk to her? Fuck. I sighed in exasperation.</p>
<p>She reached across and ruffled my hair. I looked up into her soft smile.</p>
<p>"I'm nervous too, baby. It's okay." She reassured me.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I just have so many things going around in my mind."</p>
<p>"Me, too." Amy replied. "So let me ask, you don't have a girl waiting for you back... wherever?"</p>
<p>I raised my head from the table and looked at her again.</p>
<p>"No one could ever replace you. Why even bother trying?" She adopted the relieved expression I'd had a few moments earlier.</p>
<p>"So, do you live in London now?" She asked as our waitress arrived with our coffee.</p>
<p>"No, but I do live in Europe." I tried to give her a mysterious smile.</p>
<p>"Really? That's exciting."</p>
<p>"It wasn't at first. But I've gotten used to it." I sipped my coffee.</p>
<p>"Can I ask what happened after I went upstairs that morning? When I came back down, you were gone and he wouldn't tell me where you went."</p>
<p>She had been taking a sip of her coffee, but she set it down and stared at it for a long moment. She reached over and picked up her spoon, dumped a sugar packet in her coffee and started stirring. Her small tongue slid across her lower lip, moistening it, as she prepared to speak.</p>
<p>"I was screaming at him. I couldn't believe he was blaming you for everything. And what he fucking did to you. My god..." Her eyes welled up a little, but she seemed to contain it. "It got to where I was just incoherent. I don't even remember what I was yelling anymore. I was so scared, you seemed so badly hurt."</p>
<p>She paused. "How bad was it? I never could get an answer. I found out you went to the hospital, but all they would say was that you were discharged the same day."</p>
<p>"It could have been worse." I shrugged. I didn't want to get her worked up over it now, I'd long since healed from that whole debacle.</p>
<p>"Anyway, mom took me out to the car and drove to grandma's for a while. She just wanted to get me away from him for a while. And away from you, I guess. Later, dad took me to see our uncle in New York for a couple of weeks. That was a horrible trip. I didn't want to go, of course. He threatened to have you arrested if I didn't. He refused to listen to anything I had to say about us. He was convinced that you had taken advantage of me somehow, and wouldn't let me tell him otherwise. I don't know how I never realized what an asshole he was to you before. I know you made black sheep jokes, but I didn't see how serious it was." She dropped her spoon on her napkin and took another sip of her coffee before looking back at me. The sadness in her eyes gnawed at me. I reached up and put my hand to the side of her face, hoping to reassure her. She nuzzled her face in my palm for a moment and kissed my palm before she continued speaking.</p>
<p>"Anyway, you know he canceled the cellphones. He shut off the internet connection at the house, as well. He was trying to do anything he could think of to eliminate ways for you to contact me for a while."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I figured that was what happened."</p>
<p>"By the time we got back home from New York, I was a complete wreck. I dropped out for the semester. Mom had put the rest of your stuff in storage, so your bedroom was mostly empty. I used to go in your room and just sit against the wall on the floor for hours. It was as close to you as I could get. It used to piss him off something awful. Dad even took the painting that you had given me out of my room and put it in storage with the other stuff. He never knew about this, at least." She placed her hand on the necklace I had given her.</p>
<p>It made me ache to think of how much it must have pained her to be there. At least I had been able to go somewhere new, without constant reminders of her everywhere.</p>
<p>"After a couple of weeks, mom sent me to Colorado to stay with Aunt Linda and Courtney for a while. She told them that you had some huge fight with dad, had left home, and that I was have a really hard time dealing with it. So I stayed there for a couple of months with them. I missed you so badly that I broke down one night and told Courtney the truth about us. She was shocked, but eventually she accepted it. She's never told anyone. She tried to help me find you, but by then you seemed to have disappeared off of the planet."</p>
<p>"That was two or three months after?" I asked, remembering that I had left for Greece by then.</p>
<p>"Yeah, not quite three months. We had no luck at all. When you called Aunt Linda's that first Thanksgiving, Courtney was really upset that she couldn't get to the phone in time. Mom was pretty upset, too. She just wanted to know you were okay. We weren't the only ones looking for you, either. John contacted me a few times, so did Megan. No one knew where you went. When you decided to disappear, you did a damned good job of it. Oh! Megan married Man-bun, by the way. Turns out his name is Eric." She gave me a weak smile, that grew when I started laughing.</p>
<p>"Oh wow." I laughed. I couldn't imagine Megan being married. "Does he still have a man bun?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I haven't been back there in a while. I got a job with a finance company in Portland after graduation. I've only been there a couple of months, though. I took a few days off to come here."</p>
<p>"So you got your degree? That's awesome!" I exclaimed, genuinely proud of her.</p>
<p>"Thanks," She smiled, amused at how excited I was for her. The waitress returned with our food and made sure we didn't need refills on our coffee.</p>
<p>"So what happened after Colorado?" I asked, picking up a piece of bacon and eyeing it with intent.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to go back home. I just couldn't take it there any more. I applied to transfer my credits to UCLA and was accepted. I qualified for a couple of grants and moved into the dorms there. I hit the books hard to keep myself busy. I wasn't really trying to graduate early, but that was a pleasant side effect. I was just trying to keep moving. Most of my free time was spent online trying to find any mention of you."</p>
<p>"I imagine there wasn't much to find."</p>
<p>"Not a damned thing." She agreed.</p>
<p>"Until last month when I found the announcement online for the art opening, I was worried you might have died or something. But, surely we would have gotten word of that. It was really lucky that I even heard about the show. I wasn't looking for you to be in Europe. I thought you might be in Houston or Dallas or somewhere close by. Maybe San Antonio. Surely, at least in the same country. I thought one of my best chances to find you might be if you did a show somewhere. I'm subscribed to mailing lists for art galleries all over the place. It must be more than a hundred of them. Some of the listings are for multiple galleries that do these cross promotions for each other. That's the only reason I saw anything for the show at all. When I saw your name and saw the show was in London, I couldn't believe it I feel like I haven't slept in weeks, waiting for tonight to get here. I even called the gallery from the States trying to find a home address for you. They wouldn't tell me anything."</p>
<p>"Probably thought you might be a stalker." I chuckled.</p>
<p>"My turn to ask a few things." She said, as she watched me swallow the last of the piece of bacon.</p>
<p>"Go for it."</p>
<p>"Where have you been all this time? Where did you go?"</p>
<p>" At first I stayed at Jeff... er... Dr. Miller's art studio. Once I was able to, I tried to find you and couldn't figure out how to reach you. I used to sneak by our parent's house and watch for you, but you were never there. After a while, I just kind of fell apart. Everywhere I went reminded me of you. And it hurt to be around. I was so fucked up by it all. I just couldn't stay anymore. After about a month or so, I got offered a job as Theron's personal assistant in Greece. I took it as a chance to try to get myself together. I've been living on an island in Greece ever since."</p>
<p>"Holy shit. Greece? Really?" She looked at me wide eyed, forgetting she had a fork full of shredded potatoes in her hand.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Milos, Greece."</p>
<p>"Wow. That explains your tan. What's it like?"</p>
<p>"It's fucking beautiful. The water is an amazing shade of blue and crystal clear. There's these incredible rock formations along the beach and all kinds of natural caves. It's really something." I told her as I glanced down at my hands. Tan? I hadn't realized.</p>
<p>She smiled wistfully at my description. "It sounds amazing."</p>
<p>"You like Portland?"</p>
<p>"It's okay. Rains a lot. Humid."</p>
<p>"I didn't exactly plan on Greece." I explained. "Well, I guess I kind of did, only because it was somewhere besides Austin and it was the first opportunity to come up. I would have gone anywhere. I could have been offered to go to Nigeria and I would have gone. As long as no one knew me. Somewhere without memories."</p>
<p>Amy nodded and looked out the diner window at the cars driving by out on the street, taking in the sights of London. I watched her, still trying to wrap my head around the idea that she was here. It blew me away that she had come all this way just to find me. I would have done the same if I knew that she wanted me as badly as I wanted her. But Amy had done flown here blindly after not seeing me for three years. It suddenly occurred to me that she was a braver, stronger person than I. But I had always kind of thought so.</p>
<p>"When do you head back to Greece?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Our flight leaves Monday afternoon. Yours?" It was Friday. I hadn't thought about it until this moment. There was no way in hell I was going to lose track of her again.</p>
<p>"I'm supposed to fly back day after tomorrow, but I don't think I'm going. I don't really care if I ever go back to Portland. I don't want to be away from you again." She looked at me with a hopeful expression in her eyes, as if she needed to hear that I wanted her to stay.</p>
<p>"Fuck Portland. I need you with me, Amy." I replied taking her hand again for emphasis.</p>
<p>Amy's whole face lit up in a beaming smile and she looked like she was about to launch herself over the table at me. Instead, she darted around the table and wrapped me in a huge hug, squealing in delight like she was a little kid again. I couldn't help chuckling at her. For a moment, she was my adorable little sister. And the woman of my dreams. Even now, years later, my brain sometimes hiccuped over those strangely stitched together bits of data.</p>
<p>"Oh god, Adam. I'm so fucking excited!" She gasped, as she tried her best to crack a few of my ribs in her embrace. I was hugging her back, of course. But I wasn't trying to inflict bodily harm. I happened to glance over the top of her head and noticed our waitress standing next to a couple of other staff grinning at us. I didn't care. I never wanted to let her go.</p>
<p>"I love you so much, Adam." She cried, tears of happiness sliding down her cheeks.</p>
<p>I held her to me, stroking her hair softly. "I love you too, beautiful. I love you with all my heart."</p>
<p>Finally, her arms gave out on her, and she settled in on my side of the booth with me. I pulled her plate across from her side for her and passed over her coffee. She finished her meal half sitting in my lap. I didn't mind. Although, I did have to chuckle when a bit of shredded potato went rogue and slipped down the cleavage of her dress, sending her on a flustered trip to the bathroom.</p>
<p>We spent hours sitting in the booth catching up about what had happened over the past couple of years. Amy brought me up to date on family matters, in as much as I cared to know. Brad had finally proposed to Brenda and they were married. Amy had attended the wedding as a bridesmaid, and endured a number of questions about my absence. She told me about attending UCLA and we compared our experiences in Rome. Between the time change and the long, emotional evening, Amy's adrenaline and excitement about our reunion finally lost the battle to fatigue and she suddenly seemed about to fall asleep next to me in the booth.</p>
<p>I flagged down our new waitress, as there had been a shift change in the interim, and got our bill. I made sure to tip our new waitress well, and gave her a second tip, requesting that she pass it to our former waitress. I had long had a soft spot for what I considered to be an unjust pay system for wait staff.</p>
<p>Amy climbed out of the booth and took my hand as soon as I stood up. I couldn't help noticing that one of my ass cheeks had fallen asleep. I freed my hand from hers to stretch a second, only to have it snatched back the moment I lowered my arms. As we walked out of the diner, I noticed that it looked like the sun might be coming up and checked my watch.</p>
<p>"Holy shit. It's almost five." I commented.</p>
<p>"No wonder I'm exhausted," Amy yawned. "Where's your hotel?"</p>
<p>"Whoa now... I'm not sure that's proper." I attempted my best poker face.</p>
<p>"Oh? Um.. Okay, I can-" She began, looking a little crestfallen.</p>
<p>I pointed to the tall hotel, almost directly across the street from the gallery. "It's that one."</p>
<p>"Don't do that to me. I'm tired, damn it." She whined, with a hint of amusement in her voice.</p>
<p>We walked back to the hotel, the movement causing her to wake up a little along the way.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have listened to mom." She said as the elevator doors closed in the hotel a few minutes later.</p>
<p>"I know. I'm sorry." We both knew she was talking about the letter.</p>
<p>"That's why you didn't keep trying to find me, right? After the first year, I mean."</p>
<p>I nodded, feeling guilty. I could have tried harder, and I knew it.</p>
<p>"It's okay. I get it. I saw the letter. It would have screwed me up, too." Her hand reached over to take mine. "But she's not us. And she doesn't know how strongly we feel about each other. She was wrong. Hell, she probably even realizes that by now. Not that the she isn't too stubborn to admit it. It doesn't matter anymore. You're here now."</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>The elevator doors opened a moment later and we walked down the hall to my room. I fought with the lock a moment, listening to her snicker softly as I did so. Mercifully, the damned lock finally disengaged and I let her in the room.</p>
<p>"Wow, that gallery must love you." She exclaimed as she looked around the room. While not lavish, it was a rather nice hotel room with a large living area in addition to the tiny kitchen and bathroom.</p>
<p>"This was Theron's doing. I never spoke to them." I replied.</p>
<p>She looked down at herself as if something had suddenly occurred to her.</p>
<p>"Do you have a shirt I can borrow? I can't sleep in this dress." She asked. I briefly considered suggesting she sleep nude, but found myself too shy to suggest it.</p>
<p>I walked to my luggage and pulled one of my shirts out for her. She took it from me and kissed me on the cheek.</p>
<p>"Thanks, baby." She smiled as she entered the bathroom and closed the door.</p>
<p>Feeling only the tiniest bit of disappointment at her lack of exhibitionism, I flopped on the sofa in the living area of the hotel suite. So she didn't want to get naked in front of me. Big deal, I told myself. She's back in my life, that's what matters. I didn't get much further in my thoughts than that before I was fast asleep.</p>
<p>I woke on the sofa, still in my dress shirt and slacks from the night before, with a hell of a sore neck from the angle I'd fallen asleep in. The sun, coming in through the windows was bright and I checked my phone to see what time it was. Holy crap, I thought to myself, when I realized it was already past noon. Suddenly, I remembered the night before and scanned the room. I spotted the lump bundled up on the bed and walked over to it.</p>
<p>Amy lay fast asleep, curled up in a fetal position under the blanket. Only her face, a bit of shoulder, and one hand could be seen under the wad of blankets she'd piled on herself. I guess it had been chilly when we came in the room, I couldn't remember. I noticed her dress carefully draped over a chair at the desk in the corner. Oh yeah, she'd borrowed a shirt. I leaned against the wall and folded my arms, just watching her sleep for a few minutes. Just being in the same room with her made me feel better than I had felt about the world in a long time. I marveled, not for the first time, at her angelic beauty and how peaceful she always looked when she slept. I thought about going to take a shower, but that might wake her up and I didn't want to do that. She looked too beautiful and peaceful to disturb.</p>
<p>"What?" she asked, snapping me back into focus. She stretched a long, full body stretch with both arms far above her head. The blankets shifted down her body a bit, revealing the way my old Cure shirt hugged to her body. I could make out the swell of her breasts beneath the shirt.</p>
<p>"Just watching you sleep." I replied.</p>
<p>"Mm... I did a bit of that last night myself." She yawned and scratched at her rib cage. "When I got out of the shower, you were dead to the world."</p>
<p>"Never even heard the shower turn on. Damn." I had been exhausted from nerves before the show, combined with the adrenaline of our reunion and the long night, I hadn't stood a chance of staying awake. "Speaking of showers... Back in a bit."</p>
<p>After I showered and changed clothes, she got up and took her dress into the bathroom with her to change. I couldn't help but be appreciative of her long, sexy legs sticking out from under my shirt as she vanished into the bathroom.</p>
<p>While she was changing, her phone began chiming from the nightstand. I glanced at it, reflexively and saw it was Courtney. For a moment, I considered answering it, just to mess with Courtney's head, unsure if she would recognize my voice, but thought better of it. It went to voicemail.</p>
<p>"Can you zip this for me?" Amy asked as she emerged from the bathroom holding her dress up. "Was that my phone?"</p>
<p>I couldn't help and admiring the curve of Amy's spine as I zipped it up in the dress, taking the liberty to wrap my arms around her from behind and plant a kiss on the side of her neck when I was done. She purred softly, and melted back into me, framing my arms around her with her own. She rocked back and forth for a few moments with her eyes closed, until she started trembling slightly. I moved to release her and ask what was wrong, but she snatched me back to her fiercely as soon as I shifted away.</p>
<p>"Don't." She said, softly.</p>
<p>"Okay," I replied, a little uncertain.</p>
<p>"I've missed you holding me so much. Just.. hold me, okay?"</p>
<p>"As long as you like." I replied, more than content to oblige. "Are you okay?"</p>
<p>"I'm perfect. I missed you is all. This feel so right." Her eyes were still closed as she leaned back against me, still rocking lightly. "Don't let me go."</p>
<p>"I won't. I promise. Never again." I tightened my grip around her a little, and meant every word.</p>
<p>A short while later, apparently satisfied for the moment, she collected her phone from the night stand. As she was putting on her heels, she asked "So what's the plan today?"</p>
<p>"Lunch, for certain. I don't need to be back at the gallery until this evening. Probably should check in with Theron at some point. What do you have in mind?"</p>
<p>"I'd like to go to my hotel and change before lunch, if that's okay. After we eat, maybe go see some of London? We may never be here again." She gave me a hopeful smile, one she knew was hard to resist from a lifetime of practice. I flashed on a memory of using that smile on our father when we were kids in order to score a dollhouse she'd had her eyes on for months. It had worked then, just like it working now. Hopelessly wrapped around her finger as always. Damn it.</p>
<p>We caught a cab to her hotel, where Amy changed into a simple black dress that extended almost to her ankles but had a fascinating habit of clinging to the curves of her body when she walked. For something that left so little flesh exposed, it was looked very sexy on her. After lunch, we went to see the royal palace and took a walk through St. James's Park along the lake. As we walked, she told me about her job and the friends she had made since living in Portland. I told her more about Milos and the nearby islands. Over the last couple of years, I had become acquainted with a few locals on Milos, mostly shopkeepers that I frequented and neighbors. Ever the introvert, my only true friends on the island were limited to the Cains.</p>
<p>Amy insisted we pester a female passerby to take a photo of us on the blue bridge that crossed the lake in the park, and I obliged her in the name of not spoiling the mood. She was well aware of my disdain for having my photograph taken and took advantage of my generous mood by asking the kind woman to take a few more pictures than seemed necessary. When we resumed our walk, she took my arm in hers and planted a kiss on my cheek. We had just enough time to check out the Churchill museum before going back to collect her things from her hotel and transporting them to mine.</p>
<p>I had to meet Theron at the gallery shortly after to take care of a couple of minor press interview type things that Theron's agent had set up. They went pretty much as I expected, only asking me a couple of minor questions and then focusing on Theron. I was basically a tag along for this show and I was perfectly comfortable with that. Honestly, even if they didn't ask me a single question, I was still pleased. Never, in my wildest dreams, would I have expected to have my paintings hanging in an art gallery in London. Throughout the interviews, Amy continually smiled at me from the bench that she shared with Margaret. They seemed to chat quite a bit among themselves and have a decent time of it.</p>
<p>Over dinner at a nearby restaurant, Theron informed me that the show had been very successful the night before. But both he and Margaret were much more interested in hearing about how Amy had come to be in London at the same time as us. He seemed pleased with himself when he learned that Amy had found out about the show from an announcement that she had found online.</p>
<p>"I guess I have more than one reason to be grateful to him for letting me piggyback onto his show, now." I commented to Amy, knowing that it would annoy Theron who found my self deprecation to be an irritant.</p>
<p>"He didn't piggyback onto my show. I invited him to share the gallery with me. The humble prick won't give himself any credit." Theron smirked to Amy, barely taking my bait.</p>
<p>"Adam never really has when it comes to his art." Amy replied, causing me to roll my eyes. I caught an elbow to my ribs in retaliation. That hadn't happened in a long time and my reflexes weren't up to par.</p>
<p>"You should hear how he used to go on about his skateboarding prowess when he was in high school, though. You'd think he was trying out for the Olympics." She added, causing Theron and Margaret to chuckle.</p>
<p>"Really, Amy? How many dinners did I have to sit through hearing about human pyramid this and team cheer number 437 that when you were cheer leading?" I looked at Theron, "You want to know what's truly tedious? Listening to someone spend hours practicing a cheer loudly across the hall from your bedroom."</p>
<p>We all had a great time at dinner carrying on, us telling stories of growing up back in Texas, the Cains telling us about growing up around Manchester. I quizzed him thoroughly about several of the bands that I loved from that area and was disappointed that he knew little to nothing in the way of interesting tidbits about them. I had hoped that he had seen them at early club shows or something before they made it big. Turns out Theron was too much of a bookworm for his own good and missed out on a lot of great concerts, for which I thoroughly berated him, much to his sister's amusement. Amy rolled her eyes at me, not for the first time, for going off into one of my long winded music nerd rants.</p>
<p>Throughout the meal, Amy kept her hand on my thigh, occasionally giving it a slight squeeze. She leaned on my shoulder a lot, seeming to want to keep herself in contact with me as much as possible. I wasn't complaining in the least, as I wanted the same thing.</p>
<p>The night air was crisp on the walk back to the hotel, and I found myself wishing I'd thought to bring a jacket. Amy must have felt the same way because she stayed cuddled up against me for the entire walk. We parted ways with Theron and Margaret at the hotel and retired to my room.</p>
<p>I sat on the couch in the hotel room, flipping through channels without interest while Amy showered. I thought over the logistics of getting her to Greece. We'd probably have to ship her stuff separately, I thought. I didn't know how much stuff she had, but it wasn't going to be cheap, I suspected. Maybe I'd finally go back to Austin and get the last of my stuff out of storage while I was at it. It'd be good to sever that last tie with the place. And I'm sure Dr. Miller was sick of me sending him money every six months to renew my lease on the storage space. I was trying to remember how much stuff I had left in that storage building when I heard the water shut off in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Amy walked out of the bathroom wearing the shirt she had borrowed from me the night before. Her long, slender legs were bare under the shirt once again, which extended almost halfway to her knees. Effortlessly sexy, I thought, as my eyes worshiped her lovely form.</p>
<p>"You probably shouldn't be looking at your sister like that." She said shyly, biting her lower lip.</p>
<p>"I shouldn't?" I replied, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Not if you want her to keep her clothes on." She grinned as she sashayed toward me. I found myself temporarily without a response as she neared. Her skin was flushed a slight pink from the hot water of the shower, and I could feel the heat radiating from her body although she hadn't yet touched me.</p>
<p>She stood next to me, looking down at where I was sitting on the couch with a tentative expression. I reached out and placed a hand on one of her warm, soft thighs just above her knee. Her eyes closed a moment and she let out a small sigh. Hooking my hand behind her knee, I drew her closer to me.</p>
<p>"Come here," I breathed. She sat happily across my lap, hooking an arm around my neck. Her skin was so warm and soft against me. She gave me a delighted smile, her lower lip caught between her teeth. My little sister could be so goddamned adorable.</p>
<p>Without thinking, acting on a reawakened instinct that had been dormant for years, my hand slid under her shirt over her ribs and cupped her breast. My cock, already erect, strained against my the fabric of my boxers like a wild beast shoving angrily against the bars of its cage. She whimpered, closing her eyes and clutching herself against me tightly.</p>
<p>"Oh god, Amy." I breathed as her nipple hardened against my palm. "I've missed you so fucking much."</p>
<p>Her lips found mine and our tongues met in a sensuous battle. She gripped my head in both of her hands, arching herself toward me. The fresh, mint smell of her toothpaste filled my lungs. My hand massaged her breast, as the other moved beneath her shirt, resting on the bare skin at the small of her back. Amy groaned her pleasure into my mouth, pausing to let out a ragged breath.</p>
<p>I rolled her nipple gently between my thumb and forefinger before giving it a light tug, causing her to gasp sharply. I could feel her entire body tremble in response. She rubbed her thighs together in my lap and looked up at me through half closed eyelids.</p>
<p>"Do that again." She sighed. A small smile crept across my lips as I complied. Again, I was rewarded with a sharp gasp, and I became aware that I could smell her arousal. Her thighs were locked together tightly in my lap, her eyes squeezed shut tight. The sound that escaped her lips made both my heart and my cock lurch like a bad driver downshifting on the highway.</p>
<p>I pulled her close to me, nuzzling my face against the side of her neck before planting my lips on it. She purred against me, petting the back of my head with one hand as I held her. My lips moved up the curve of her throat, pausing to feel her pulse racing through the vein in her neck. Impulsively, I licked it, using my tongue to feel the throb of her heartbeat. I kept going to her jawline, then nibbled her earlobe gently, causing her to shiver.</p>
<p>"I love you so much, beautiful." I whispered directly into her ear canal. I punctuated the statement with a kiss right where her ear and her jaw met, a spot I remembered she loved to be kissed. "I still can't believe I'm holding you again."</p>
<p>She pulled away from me slightly, looking directly in my eyes. Her eyes shimmered before me, filled with a deep and consuming love that was plainly visible within them. Her mouth opened the tiniest bit, and I thought I heard an intake of breath before she dove on me. Her mouth and tongue working their way the length of my neck as I had done to hers. She bathed the area between my clavicle and neck with her tongue before fastening her mouth to the tendon just above it and sucking as hard as she could. I couldn't resist a tiny chuckle, despite the erotic moment, as I knew exactly what she was up to. She liked to leave her mark on me, but was often unable to do so as much as she wished due to the secrecy of our relationship. But that need for secrecy was no longer present, and she claimed her territory with abandon.</p>
<p>I continued to massage her breast with my hand, while she kissed all around my neck, unwilling to release my hold on her wonderfully soft flesh. It had been so long since I'd held her in my arms and felt her body against mine. I had long wondered what it would be like to be with my little sister again like this, imagining in my head that the hunger for her would overtake me and I'd all but tackle her to the ground and take her right wherever I happened to find her.</p>
<p>Instead, I found myself worshiping every moment I spent with her, taking my time to enjoy every sensation that was revisited on my body and making sure that I gave her more than she gave me. I knew that part of that was a bid to prolong the moment I actually entered her, which I still felt anxious about. It had been more than three years, after all. I knew my chances of lasting long once she invited me to enter her were all but non-existent. So I felt like it was my mission to be sure that everything else was totally memorable for her. She was the most precious thing in the world to me, and I wanted her to know it.</p>
<p>Amy, apparently satisfied with her efforts on my neck, let go of me to put a hand on either side of the sofa behind me and lifted herself up from me. She swung a leg around, pivoting so that she was straddling me and settled back down against me. I felt my erection pressing against her crotch, and even through the clothes we had on, I could feel the heat emitting from her.</p>
<p>"There," she sighed contentedly as she ground her panties-clad mound against my crotch, "that's more like it."</p>
<p>Suddenly finding myself with better access to her body without risk of letting her fall to the floor, I moved my other hand under her shirt to take her second breast in my hand as well. She moaned her approval, followed by her breathing becoming more rapid. My thumbs grazed her nipples, toying with them while I palmed her breasts, pushing them together and kneading them like a kitten with a rag.</p>
<p>She mumbled something I couldn't make out between her raspy breaths.</p>
<p>"What was that?" I asked softly, nuzzling her throat gently before I placed a kiss on her esophagus.</p>
<p>"I said I've missed you touching me. Your hands on me." She repeated. "Fuck, I feel like I'm about to come already."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't mind," I grinned into her throat, as I found and gently tugged both of her hardened nipples at once. A loud groan shuddered from her body, her thighs quivering so much that I could see them vibrating from the corner of my eye. She ground her crotch against mine.</p>
<p>"That was playing dirty." She groaned in my ear, tilting her head the other way causing her long black hair to fan out and away from the side of her neck I had not yet kissed. I didn't feel the least bit guilty.</p>
<p>Instead, I dropped my hands from her breasts and hooked my fingers around the hem of her shirt, lifting it up. She raised her arms as I pulled it off of her, exposing her beautiful, round, creamy breasts to me. I took a moment, with my hands resting on her hips, to appreciate the vision before me.</p>
<p>"You're staring at me." She blushed.</p>
<p>"I can't help it. You're so beautiful." I replied, cupping a breast lovingly in my hand as I gazed at her.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you think so. You're not bad either, you know." She smiled as she tugged on my shirt as well.</p>
<p>I leaned forward from the back of the couch so she could pull my shirt off and drop it beside us on top of her own. She moved back against me and I felt her nipples graze against my chest, the contact sending delicious chills through me. I hugged her bare torso against mine, feeling the warmth from her body. My hands glided down her back to cup the globes of her ass, pulling her against me as she planted kisses across my shoulder.</p>
<p>"Take me to bed, baby. I need you." She breathed. I was in no position to deny my beautiful sister anything, and tightened my grip on her ass to ensure I was supporting her. I stood as she wrapped her legs around my waist and carried her to the bed, gently setting her down on the edge of it.</p>
<p>She rolled away from me and I was left staring at the graceful curve of her bare back and her gorgeous ass, now only partially hidden from my view by a very small pair of black panties. She climbed up on to the bed and laid down across it. She looked over her bare shoulder at me with a glance that made me swallow hard. I pulled off my shorts and boxers, then crawled into the bed, planting a kiss on her spine as I lay down.</p>
<p>Amy rolled to face me, smiling wickedly, and slid down the bed. I felt her hot breath on my penis and held my breath in anticipation. Her tongue bathed the head of my cock for a moment, then her mouth closed over it and began moving me in and out of her mouth. I gathered her hair in my hands, keeping it out of her face as she alternated between licking and sucking my shaft. Her delicate fingers raked their nails lightly over my balls, making me suck in a sharp breath.</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>"Oh god, baby. You're amazing." I sighed, as she purred happily in response. Her eyes were watching mine as I gazed down at her. I brought a hand down to graze her cheek, affectionately, and her eyes close softly. She let out a contented hum that vibrated down my cock and made it lurch against her. I felt my balls tightening up and ran my fingers through her hair, trying not to buck my hips into her face.</p>
<p>"Jesus, Amy. I'm gonna come." I groaned. She just purred around my cock and began bobbing her head faster. Within moments I began erupting in my sweet baby sister's mouth. She moaned excitedly, swallowing my load as fast as she could. For a brief moment, I felt like I would never stop ejaculating. But, it finally subsided, and I rolled onto my back, out of breath. Amy crawled up to join me, laying her head on my shoulder. I put an arm around her as she cuddled up to me.</p>
<p>"Did your baby sister do good?" She softly asked, with a hint of playfulness in her voice.</p>
<p>"So good," I replied, before my hand crept over to play with her exposed breast. She smiled against me as I kneaded her soft flesh, feeling her nipple against my palm. She was clearly enjoying the attention and playfully gave my neck a series of small kisses, licks, and nips as I felt her up. Eventually, I let my hand slide down her side, tracing the outline of her wonderful flesh. It glided down over her ribs, along the side of her stomach which now fluttered under my gentle touch, up along the swell of her hip and finally settled to clutch her ass. She moaned deliciously under my touch and seemed to hold her breath the lower my hand moved.</p>
<p>"I'll never get tired of your touch, baby." She breathed.</p>
<p>I smiled and gave her ass a good squeeze as a reply, then rolled her onto her back and began kissing her breasts. One of her hands was on my head, holding me to her breast as my tongue worshiped her nipple with great reverence. Her other hand was clutching the pillow above her in a fist, as she arched her back, trying to force more of her breast in my mouth. Amy let out a loud moan that filled the room. I continued to suckle on her nipple for a few more moments before moving to give her other nipple a similar treatment.</p>
<p>Amy's stomach fluttered every time my lips touched her skin as I moved progressively lower on her body. Her gasps became more and more audible as she was lost to the sensation of my touch. My fingers hooked into the material of her panties at her hips and she raised her ass to allow me to remove them from her. The smell of her arousal made my erection ache with need. I'd had my eyes closed, taking in her scent, and I suddenly realized that she was no longer shaved. Instead, she had a neatly trimmed patch of black fur above her lips. I didn't comment on it, instead choosing to nuzzle it lightly with my cheek in a fluid motion as I moved the last half inch to slide my tongue over her slit.</p>
<p>Her body trembled in response and I heard a sharp gasp above me. I parted her welcoming folds with my tongue and began lapping at the glistening secretions that her body released. She writhed above me, both of her hands clutching at her breasts as she released a series of ragged moans. Sliding a finger into her, I brought my tongue up to gently make a pass over her clit. No sooner did my tongue make contact than she bucked her hips, letting out a cry of release loud enough that there was no way the people in neighboring hotel rooms did not hear. She doubled over away from me, thighs clamped tightly together, eyes clinched. Her entire body was shaking from the force of her orgasm.</p>
<p>I moved up next to her, feeling a little pleased with myself, and gently stroked her hair. She rolled over to smile at me, and wrapped her arms around me. Her lips moved up to meet mine in a long, passionate kiss. She pulled me against her and rolled onto her back, I rolled with her until I was positioned above her. Her legs parted and she snaked a hand down to grab my shaft.</p>
<p>"I'm dying to feel you inside me." She sighed, giving me one of her most seductive smiles.</p>
<p>She positioned me over her entrance and I gently slid forward, easily gliding into her wet folds. We both moaned as her pussy swallowed my entire length, her body welcoming me into her like the long, lost love that I was. I began to move in and out of her, thrusting gently as her body began thrusting back at me. Her feet came up to hook behind my thighs, pulling me against her harder with each downward stroke. Her body felt like it was on fire beneath me. She whimpered and moaned with every stroke, jagged breaths escaping her as she shoved herself against me for all she was worth.</p>
<p>"Oh, Adam," she moaned my name, "Oh fuck."</p>
<p>I increased my thrusts, knowing that there was no greater feeling in the world than being inside her. My need for her seemed to transcend the physical. I didn't believe in souls, but if I did, I might have argued that my soul yearned for her as I continued my thrusts. She began holding her breaths, then releasing them in small whimpers as her orgasm drew closer. I rolled my hips a little as I thrust, trying to increase the sensation for her of my dick sliding into her tight canal. One of my hands moved up to massage her breast, and she let out a loud moan.</p>
<p>"So close, baby. I'm so close." She whispered, as both of her hands clutched the bed sheets above her head.</p>
<p>I could feel my own orgasm beginning to build as I took in the erotic vision below me. She was the loveliest and most exquisite creature I'd ever seen, and seeing her losing herself in ecstasy was something that had always rattled me to my core. It felt magnified ten fold by this moment, our bodies joined after so long.</p>
<p>"Come for me, princess." I whispered against her ear. "I want to hear you come."</p>
<p>Her hands wrapped around the back of my head, holding me against her face as she placed her mouth against my ear.</p>
<p>"Soon, my love," she managed to gasp into my ear between moans. "Oh god... All for you... uhhhn... baby."</p>
<p>Her hands kept my head gripped tight, as her groans raised in pitch and intensity. She seemed incapable of speaking as our bodies rocked together.</p>
<p>"That's it, beautiful. Come for me." I repeated, feeling the walls of her pussy clenching hard against me. She let out a loud cry, her quivering thighs gripping my hips as tightly as she could. Amy's small frame bucked hard against me, her chest heaving and forcing out a series of loud cries as wave after wave of her orgasm slammed through her body. My own body propelled toward orgasm in response to her cries and I groaned out her name as my cock released a jet of semen into her body, triggering a second orgasm from deep within her. She shook violently beneath me, vibrating like a tuning fork as my dick continued to erupt, bathing her walls with my come.</p>
<p>When I became aware of my surroundings again, erection fading rapidly inside her, I realized that she was crying.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" I asked, concerned, brushing her hair from her lovely face.</p>
<p>"Nothing at all." She sniffled, smiling as she rolled over to cuddle tightly against me.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes, another tear sliding down her face toward the pillow, to lock them on my own. "I was starting to think I may never see you again. But here you are. And it's everything I want it to be. I love you, Adam. I love you so fucking much."</p>
<p>"I love you, too. I'll love you til I'm dead and gone." I replied, pulling her more tightly against me.</p>
<p>By morning, we'd had sex four times, I'd lost count of her orgasms, and we were both feeling rather raw and sore. When we finally fell asleep, wrapped in each others arms, the sun was beginning to come up. I know I would have happily slept until afternoon if the hotel room hadn't rung at ten in the morning and woke me up. I strained to reach it from my current position half under Amy's sleeping form.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" I answered groggily.</p>
<p>"Long night?" I could hear the humor in Theron's voice.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" I asked, not being awake enough yet for verbal warfare.</p>
<p>"Well, we were going to see if you two wanted to meet for breakfast in an hour, but why don't we try to meet up for lunch instead? Say around one? Clearly you need more sleep."</p>
<p>"Sounds good. Lobby at one?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Perfect. See you then."</p>
<p>I think I was asleep again before the phone finished settling on the cradle.</p>
<p>A couple of hours later, freshly showered, I sat in the lobby with Amy. Theron and Margaret walked up to us, smiling. They both looked tired.</p>
<p>"Didn't sleep much either, I guess?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Well, we would have, but the couple in the room next to us kept us up half the night." He smirked. I'd forgotten their room was next door to mine.</p>
<p>"Oh god!" Amy blushed deeper than I had ever seen her, and buried her face in her hands. I started cracking up, finding her embarrassment far too amusing to be very bothered by my own role in the matter. Theron and Margaret were both laughing as well.</p>
<p>Finally, Margaret put a hand on Amy's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Relax, dear. A little lost sleep is a tiny price to pay for seeing your brother so happy this morning. I've never seen him this way."</p>
<p>Amy looked up at her and went from blushing to pale.</p>
<p>"Oh, I guess he was too busy to catch you up on things." Margaret smiled, reassuringly. Then she sat up in a formal pose and motioned to Theron. "Amy, I'd like you to meet my brother, Theron."</p>
<p>Theron nodded his head, smiling, and said. "Nice to meet you, Amy."</p>
<p>"Wow." Amy looked at me wide eyed and back at them.</p>
<p>"That's how I wound up in Greece." I explained. "I told Dr. Miller the truth about what happened when he wanted to know why I couldn't go home when I left the hospital that day. He was friends with Theron and thought that it may help for me to be around people who understood what we'd been dealing with."</p>
<p>Amy nodded and began to relax. She took my hand in hers.</p>
<p>"Now then, have you bothered to check reviews of the show yet? I imagine not." Theron asked me.</p>
<p>"No, I haven't."</p>
<p>"I thought not." He replied with a smirk, passing his tablet computer to me. "You sounded a bit preoccupied last night."</p>
<p>Amy blushed again, but not as red as she had been. I looked down at the tablet. The screen was on a website of a world famous art critic. The article talked about how successful Theron Cain's new exhibit was and talked, at length, glowingly, about the work of a new artist named Adam Matheson. My jaw fell open and I looked up at Theron who was now grinning ear to ear.</p>
<p>"What?" Asked Amy. I passed her the tablet.</p>
<p>"That's not the only one, either." Theron said. "I've read nothing but positive reviews all morning."</p>
<p>"Holy shit." I replied.</p>
<p>"...Matheson's work exposes the unspoken visceral truths of the human condition." Amy read aloud from the article, grinning at me like a madwoman.</p>
<p>I cocked an eyebrow at her.</p>
<p>"What the hell paintings was he looking at?" I asked as Theron burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"Let's get some food, we can look over reviews later." Margaret spoke up, amused, but clearly hungry.</p>
<p>"Definitely," I agreed, having not eaten since before the show last night.</p>
<p>"What time is your flight?" I asked Amy, suddenly remembering that she was supposed to return to the States today.</p>
<p>"In about... six hours," She said, looking down at her phone to check the time.</p>
<p>"Are you trying to get rid of me already?" She teased.</p>
<p>"Hell, no. I'm just thinking about how long we have to decide how we're handle everything, logistically speaking.." I replied.</p>
<p>Over lunch, we worked out that Amy would go back to Portland that night after all, in order to get things ready to be able to join me in Greece. When I got back to the island, I'd work on getting things ready for a second person to share the apartment for a while, until we could find something a little bit larger. Then I'd likely fly to Portland to help her get things sorted out and packed.</p>
<p>At one point during the meal, Amy got a phone call. I watched in mild amusement as she excitedly told Courtney that she had, indeed, found me in London. There were a lot of half finished sentences machine gunning back and forth across the phone line, and Theron began snickering. I wasn't far behind him, earning both of us stern looks from Margaret. Amy was nearly bouncing in the booth when she told Courtney that she was moving to Europe to live with me.</p>
<p>After lunch, I made arrangements to meet back up with the Cains after seeing Amy off at the airport and we parted company so that Amy I spend time together before she had to leave.</p>
<p>"When did you get to London?" I asked, taking in the amount of clothes she had spread across the bed in the hotel room. Most of them had been packed already, and for reasons unfathomable to me, she had unpacked just to return them to her bags a few minutes later. If Theron was right and there were a lot more shows on the horizon, I suspected I'd see a scene like this play out many times in the future.</p>
<p>"Friday afternoon. Why?" She asked as she started stacking the clothes in her suitcase.</p>
<p>"Just noticing that you still pack three times as many clothes as you need."</p>
<p>"Oh shut up."</p>
<p>I picked up a heavily creased piece of paper, that had fallen from her luggage. It had been folded and refolded so many times that it practically fell open in my hand. It was a printed page from the gallery's website promoting our exhibit. It mentioned Theron most prominently, but stated that the exhibit would also feature "new works by American abstract artist Adam Matheson." My name had been circled on the page with a pen multiple times and had several question marks drawn next to it. Little feminine looking hearts were doodled along the edge of the page as well as what I thought looked like a couple of flight numbers.</p>
<p>"Snoop." Amy said, looking up from her packing.</p>
<p>"Stalker."</p>
<p>"Gonna get a restraining order?" She asked playfully. Her hair sliding forward across her face as she packed.</p>
<p>"I don't think I have to worry too much. You're not very good at it." I smirked.</p>
<p>"Well, I didn't have much to work with, jackass."</p>
<p>"I haven't been called that in a long time." I chuckled. She laughed too, and we fell into a comfortable silence for a few minutes while she finished packing up the last of her stuff. It was so great hearing her laugh. Being called a jackass gave me a warm familiar feeling in my heart. Most of my life, that had been a term meant to annoy me. In some ways, it still was. But it's funny the meaning had changed over the years. And how badly I now realized I had missed the moniker.</p>
<p>"Do you still talk to our parents?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I keep in touch with mom. It's tense sometimes. She knows I was still looking for you. She keeps holding out hope that I'll drop it. Dad, not so much. It's never been the same. I tried to not be angry with him. I mean, I know we shocked the hell out of them both, but he reacted so badly. What he did to you." She shuddered at the memory. I was never that horrified by his actions against me. I had worried more about her than myself throughout that whole event. I realized now just how hard it had to have been for her to witness. And it seemed to have burned in her memory. "We just don't have much to say to each other, anymore. At least not much that won't lead to a screaming match. He knows I resent him. And I don't think he's in too big of a hurry to try to change my mind about it."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I don't know that it would ever have gone any differently. I always knew that our relationship would cost us. No matter how many ways I thought of to try to tell them about us, I always felt like the end result was the same. They just couldn't accept it. And I can't even really fault them for that. It's got to be a hard thing to come to terms with. And it's not like we exactly eased them into it, either."</p>
<p>Amy came over and sat in my lap, wrapping her arms around me in a big hug. She smelled wonderful.</p>
<p>"It was worth it though, right?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Absolutely worth it." I replied, returning her hug.</p>
<p>"Are you going to tell them you found me?" I asked. My fingers ran through her hair affectionately. Her eyes closed and she tilted her head into my hand.</p>
<p>"I'll need to tell mom sooner or later." She said with a sigh.</p>
<p>"I can't just leave the country without a word. Unlike some people." Amy emphasized the word 'some' while giving me a look of fake irritation.</p>
<p>"That should be an interesting conversation. I don't envy you." I tactfully elected to ignore the second part of her comment.</p>
<p>"You're not going to disappear again while I'm in Portland, right?" She smiled while she asked, but I could see the glint of worry in her eyes. "I know it's a silly thing to worry about. I just.. want to hear you say it, I guess."</p>
<p>"I'll never disappear on you again, sweetheart. I promise."</p>
<p>"You'd better not. I'll stalk you again just to kick your ass." She reached for her phone and checked the time.</p>
<p>"How much longer before we need to get you to the airport?"</p>
<p>"I really need to head over there in about two hours."</p>
<p>My heart sank a bit at the thought of her going away again, even if it was only for a couple of weeks. Hopefully, I'd be able to visit her in Portland sooner than that.</p>
<p>"That sucks."</p>
<p>"I was just thinking the same thing. You think two hours is long enough for sex, a shower, and a cab ride to Heathrow?" She grinned at me and ground herself in my lap suggestively.</p>
<p>"We can certainly give it a good try."</p>
<p>It was hard to let her get on the plane. I got the feeling that it was just as hard for her to leave me behind. We exchanged our phone numbers and she made sure that she got Theron and Margaret's as well. I held her in my arms at the boarding gate until the flight attendant finally told her to get on the plane or miss the flight.</p>
<p>I stayed at the airport until I saw the plane take off, pondering the turn of events that had occurred in the last 48 hours. We had been reunited for less than two days. And then she was gone again, even if it wasn't for very long. I resisted an urge to walk to the ticket counter right that moment and book the next flight back to the States. I felt a familiar tightness in my chest that I hadn't experienced in a couple of years. I sat on a bench with my hands on my knees, staring resolutely at the ground. Taking a few deep breaths, I managed to calm myself down. Finally, I caught a cab back to my hotel and took a long nap.</p>
<p>That night, I met up with Theron and Margaret for dinner. They could barely stop smiling at me the entire time and made me self conscious. Margaret, in particular, was beside herself with excitement.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a long couple of weeks." I mused.</p>
<p>"I have a feeling it's going to go by faster than you think." Theron replied between bites of steak.</p>
<p>"I hope so. I just need to get a new bed and clean up the apartment a bit. There isn't a lot of prep work to be done, really." I thought out loud as I stabbed a piece of potato with my fork and stared at it absently.</p>
<p>"Thanks for being okay with her moving into the apartment with me. It really means a lot." I added, looking up at Theron.</p>
<p>"Absolutely. We wouldn't have it any other way." Margaret spoke up as Theron nodded.</p>
<p>"Did you get a chance to look over any other reviews yet?" Theron asked, knowing full well that I hadn't.</p>
<p>When I shook my head, he wiped his hands off on his napkin and pulled his tablet computer out again. He opened a website and passed it over to me.</p>
<p>"Matheson is an essential and uniquely American voice responding to the current postmodern condition." I read aloud, making a sour face at the screen.</p>
<p>"Seriously, where do they get this stuff? What the hell does that even mean? Do these guys just keep a thesaurus on the back of their toilet and make up statements about the stuff they look at? Look at this bullshit." I motioned to one of the paintings photographed in the article and read from the caption beneath it. "...a raw, visceral look into a fractured mind.' Seriously? It's an aborted attempt to paint a goddamned nautilus shell that I added a bunch of godforsaken sponge textures over!"</p>

<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>Theron was laughing so hard that his face was nearly purple. Margaret was cackling as well, trying to keep her tears of laughter from streaking her makeup.</p>
<p>"You are hilarious when you start ranting, you know that?" Theron gasped.</p>
<p>"So I've been told." I replied, still looking at the article and wondering what the hell these critics saw that I didn't when I painted. I suspected that they were making things up in order to justify their jobs.</p>
<p>"The point is, things are gonna start happening. You don't see this many positive reviews without calls starting to come in from other galleries. You'll see." He gave me a knowing grin.</p>
<p>"Yeah, right." I replied, sarcastically. There was less conviction in my voice, and they both picked up on it. The reviews were very positive, and I was beginning to seriously wonder if I was might have a real shot at making a living at an artist. I was still far from convinced, of course.</p>
<p>That night I tossed and turned in the hotel bed, unable to get comfortable. I stared at the ceiling waiting impatiently to hear that she had landed safely in the US. Frustrated, I raided the room's minibar and was pouring myself a rum and coke when my cellphone chirped at me with a text from Amy.</p>
<p>"Just landed. Missing the hell out of you already. Love you."</p>
<p>Breathing a sigh of relief, I sent back my reply. "We'll be together again soon. Just not soon enough. Love you, too. This is going to take forever."</p>
<p>"Did you find my present?" Present? I glanced around the room. Was I missing something?</p>
<p>"Present?" I sent back.</p>
<p>"I left a memento in your suitcase. ;)"</p>
<p>I walked over to my suitcase and dug around in it for a moment. I didn't see anything that shouldn't have been there. After a little reflection, I did notice something missing though.</p>
<p>"Did you steal my dress shirt?" I sent.</p>
<p>"...maybe." I started chuckling when I saw her reply.</p>
<p>"Brat."</p>
<p>"I left something in return. You didn't see it?"</p>
<p>I went back to the suitcase and dug some more. I found the black pair of panties she'd worn the night before shoved in the pocket of my dress slacks.</p>
<p>"Found 'em."</p>
<p>"Just something to remind you of me until we can be together again. ;)"</p>
<p>"Tease."</p>
<p>"Yep. Guilty. Not sorry, either. I'm going to sleep in this shirt every night. I won't ask you to do the same with my underwear. Unless you want to, that is."</p>
<p>"Not happening." I smirked as I sent my reply.</p>
<p>"Damn. A girl can dream."</p>
<p>"New fetish?"</p>
<p>"Nope. I've got plenty of those already. Funny thing is, they all involve my big brother."</p>
<p>"You're going to make this last bit of time apart as hard as you can, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"I like making it hard."</p>
<p>"Still a damned tease." I smirked as I sent the reply.</p>
<p>A few moments later, an image arrived. Chuckling to myself, as I remembered her photos that she had sent me from Rome, years before, I clicked the image file to open it. It was a photo taken in what appeared to be a bathroom. Her torso was in the photo, covered only by my dress shirt which was left unbuttoned. The curve of her breasts and the space between them was clearly visible in the photo, but her nipples remained covered by the shirt. It was sexy as hell.</p>
<p>The phone vibrated again with another text.</p>
<p>"Feeling teased yet?"</p>
<p>"Definitely."</p>
<p>"Good. I'm at my car now, gotta drive home. Goodnight, love."</p>
<p>"Goodnight, beautiful."</p>
<p>I plugged my phone into the charger on the nightstand and double checked the alarm. Swallowing the last of my rum and coke, I kicked back on the bed to try to sleep. It took a while, but I eventually drifted off.</p>
<p>By the time we got back home in Milos, the London gallery had sold several of my pieces, even at the insanely inflated prices. Theron gave me a smug grin at the news and I had to admit defeat on the pricing argument. The gallery also had multiple requests from other galleries trying to reach out to me for possible shows, just as Theron had predicted.</p>
<p>Theron pointed out that I was now in the kind of position as an artist that I needed to get representation. He offered to set me up for a meeting with his agent, and I gratefully accepted the help. I had no idea how to even begin to navigate the intricacies of arranging showings and contracts with galleries, much less when dealing with them in multiple countries. Offers were coming in from Germany, Italy, and France already. It had not even been a full week yet. How the hell was this happening? My mind boggled.</p>
<p>Theron and Margaret just beamed at me like proud parents while I stared at them incredulously.</p>
<p>"I told you that it was only a matter of time, Adam." Theron grinned over dinner that evening.</p>
<p>"You did. But it's just crazy. I mean, damn. Surely, they'll figure out it's a fluke and pull the offers, right? I mean, there's no way my stuff's going to be hanging all over Europe like that." I was still mystified by the whole thing.</p>
<p>"It doesn't really work like that. The real trick is, you can't let it go to your head when things get rolling. Don't go spending all kinds of money on stupid shit. Save it. Invest it. Don't be that guy that starts making money and spending it just as fast, you know?" He advised.</p>
<p>"If it came to that, Amy could probably help. She's got a degree in finance. I'm sure she would have some investment ideas. I don't know anything about that kind of stuff. If, by some chance, I wind up making decent money at this, I don't see myself blowing it all anyway. But I do hear what you're saying. I appreciate the advice."</p>
<p>"You've already made more from the London show than the last three years combined and it's only the first week. Things are going to start happening faster now. You need to be ready for it."</p>
<p>"Jesus." I needed a beer.</p>
<p>Theron and I met with his agent, Damian, in Athens a few days later. After going over the details of what help he could offer me, we argued a bit over his percentage. I signed some paperwork and we shook hands. I walked out of the meeting with an agent. I was now an artist with representation. Damn.</p>
<p>I messaged Amy that the meeting had been successful, hoping that I didn't wake her up. The ten hour time difference meant it was still in the middle of the night in Portland.</p>
<p>I spent the next couple of days cleaning up the apartment and repainting over a failed mural attempt that I had been tinkering with on one wall of the living area. Margaret was a little upset with me for painting over it, knowing how many hours I had sunk into the project. She was amused at how much work I put into trying to make the small apartment look less like a bachelor pad.</p>
<p>"You think Amy is going to care one bit about what the place looks like after so long apart?" She asked me.</p>
<p>"Probably not, but I'd like her to at least be comfortable here. I checked out the rent house at the end of the block again yesterday. I think it may be a real possibility if all goes well."</p>
<p>"Talking about moving out again? We've told you that you are more than welcome here as long as you like." She sounded exasperated.</p>
<p>"My stuff fits here just fine right now, but once I get the rest of my stuff shipped from Texas as well as Amy's stuff, it's going to be more than cramped. Trust me. You've never seen her closets. We'll need the space." I was being serious, but couldn't help grinning at Margaret's smirk.</p>
<p>"You may have a point there." She conceded as she glanced at the lone closet in the apartment. "It really isn't a very big space."</p>
<p>I finally returned to my home town a few days later. It was a short, overnight trip to pack and ship my remaining possessions from the storage building that I had been sending Dr. Miller money to maintain for me while I was away. I did not expect to see Austin again after this, having no further reason to be there in my estimation. It felt really strange to be back, but it didn't feel like the horror show of an existence that it had been when I left. Unlike before, I didn't feel a cloud of doom over me with every step. Amy and I discussed going to Austin together to talk to our mother about her leaving the country to be with me, but had decided against it.</p>
<p>I originally planned to rent a car, but realized that my driver's license had expired while I was abroad. Resigned to my fate, I took a cab to a favorite diner to grab some lunch before I got busy with the things I needed to take care of. I was midway through what I thought might be the best cheeseburger I'd ever had in my life, while answering an email from my new agent about a possible show in Berlin when I saw my mother walk into the diner with two of her friends. I had been in the country for all of three hours and I had already managed to step in shit. God damn it. I stared down at my phone, hoping she wouldn't see me.</p>
<p>"Adam!" My mother exhaled, excusing herself from her friends to walk over to my table. Screw every possible moment of my life, I thought to myself. I had no idea what I was going to say to her.</p>
<p>I looked up at her, genuinely unsure of what to say.</p>
<p>"Hi." I said, with a little apprehension. To be fair, she looked as apprehensive as I felt.</p>
<p>"How have you been?" I asked, feeling about as awkward as one could.</p>
<p>"Um.. Okay, I suppose. And you?" She asked.</p>
<p>"I am... Probably the best I've been in a long time," I paused. "This is really weird, mom. Do you want to sit?"</p>
<p>I pointed at the red chair across from me.</p>
<p>She sat in the chair and looked me over. She looked like a sea of emotions were boiling behind her eyes. I was suddenly glad that we were in a public place.</p>
<p>"You have gotten really tan. Are you working construction or something? What do you do?"</p>
<p>"I mostly paint." I looked at my arms. Had I really gotten that tan? Amy had told me the same thing. Weird.</p>
<p>"Houses?"</p>
<p>"I'm am an art assistant. I paint canvases in my free time. Same thing I did here." I fought back an urge to sneer.</p>
<p>"Do you live here in Austin?" She asked.</p>
<p>"No, I'm just in town for the day."</p>
<p>"Oh." She blinked. "We haven't heard from you at all."</p>
<p>"Dad told me not to. He was pretty damned clear about his feelings on the matter, if you recall." I had a little gravel in my voice when I said it and hadn't exactly planned to.</p>
<p>"Yes, but I thought once things calmed down..."</p>
<p>"Oh? Does he ask about me? Does he say he wishes I'd come for Christmas dinner? I imagine he doesn't." I snapped.</p>
<p>"Well, no." She was taken aback.</p>
<p>"Mom, look. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be snippy with you." I sighed, dialing in my irritation. I hadn't meant to snap at her. "And I'm really sorry about the way things went that day. It wasn't the way we wanted you guys to find out about us. I'm sure Amy told you we were planning to sit you guy down and talk about it eventually. I honestly don't think that it would have changed anything. It's not like I ever expected him to take it calmly. I'm not even sure I blame him for reacting the way he did. But we never meant to throw it in your face or hurt anyone."</p>
<p>"Probably not. You couldn't have been foolish enough to think we would be okay with... that." She made a face.</p>
<p>"No, I didn't. I don't expect you to accept it, and I don't think that she does either. But I love her, mom. I love her like I've never loved anything in this world." I paused and stared intently at her for a moment as my brain clicked some thoughts into place.</p>
<p>"Have you talked to her?" She asked.</p>
<p>"About a week and a half ago. She found me in Europe. First time I've seen her since that morning at your house." I didn't even think of it as "home" anymore.</p>
<p>"Europe?" Now she really looked surprised. I ignored the question. It didn't matter.</p>
<p>"I did what you asked in your letter. I stayed away from her for years. I loved her so much that I tried to let her move on with her life like you asked. Three years of no contact, and she never stopped looking for me. Hell, she flew all the way to London to find me. What does that tell you? And we have found that we love each other as much as we ever did. Probably even more. We didn't ask for this to happen. We never meant to fall in love. But it did happen. And it's real. And it's clearly not going away."</p>
<p>She started to cry softly. I passed her a napkin before continuing.</p>
<p>"Look, I've made a lot of mistakes in my life and I'm sure I'm going to make a lot more of them. But loving Amy isn't one of them. I ran like a coward for a long time, trying to honor your wishes to let her move on with her life. I'm done with that. All it did was hurt. Do you understand? You don't have to accept it. But do you at least understand that it is real?"</p>
<p>She slowly nodded her head at me.</p>
<p>"She's coming to live with me."</p>
<p>"I can't say I'm surprised." She said, sadly. "What do I tell your father?"</p>
<p>"I don't care. Tell him whatever you want." I shrugged. "He disowned me. No reason for his opinion to matter to me at all."</p>
<p>"Where are you going to be?"</p>
<p>"I don't really factor into your lives anymore, so I'll leave it to Amy to decide if she wants to tell you or not. I don't feel like it's my place to say." I replied. "But I'm sorry we hurt you, mom. I really am."</p>
<p>I took a bite of my burger and watched her as she looked at me for a long time not saying anything. Part of me wondered what had gotten in to me. I was surprised by how much I found that I really did not care what they thought anymore. I finished chewing the bite, suddenly realizing that I was no longer hungry, and swallowed. The loss of appetite was disappointing, considering how awesome it was to have a legitimate cheeseburger again. I tossed the rest of the burger on the plate.</p>
<p>Dropping my napkin in the middle of the plate, I grabbed my bag and stood up to leave.</p>
<p>"Take care of yourself," I told her, not really knowing what else to say.</p>
<p>"You too, Adam." she said. As I turned to walk away, she added. "You take care of her, too."</p>
<p>"I'll do my best, mom. I promise." I looked back at her with a small smile.</p>
<p>"I believe you." She smiled sadly. "I'm not okay with this. Don't misunderstand."</p>
<p>"I understand. I wasn't okay with it for a long time, either. We don't choose who we love. But she is the greatest thing in the world. I wouldn't trade her for anything." I put a hand on her shoulder. "Bye, mom."</p>
<p>I walked out the restaurant feeling like there might be some small hope for reconciliation with our mother. I knew better than to even think that about dad, but I was prepared to live with that. I called Amy and told her about the encounter. She was more than relieved that she would not have to be the one to tell mother about the upcoming move.</p>
<p>I met up with Jeff Miller later that afternoon and used his truck to bring the stuff from the storage unit to his art studio. We packed my paintings from the unit into padded shipping crates, along with the rest of my stuff. A shipping company would be picking them up to deliver to Greece in the coming days. Although he tried not to let me, I made sure to give him at least some compensation for his trouble.</p>
<p>Over dinner that night, I caught him up on some of the successes I had experienced with my art in Europe. I showed him pictures of some of my recent work and he approved of my progress. He was very pleased to hear about my success at the London show and was impressed that things were moving along for me at the pace that they were. Jeff and his wife, Becky, both expressed how glad they were to see that I was doing so much better than when they had last seen me. I thanked him again for his help during the hardest time of my life. When he dropped me off in front of my hotel for the evening, he passed me a couple of books that he asked me to bring to Theron for him. I promised that I would and headed inside.</p>
<p>Once I got checked in, I took a quick shower, then slouched on the bed and sent Amy a text.</p>
<p>"Can't wait to see you tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Me either, baby! I'm so excited!"</p>
<p>"Did mom call you?"</p>
<p>"Not yet, but I'm sure she will."</p>
<p>I flipped channels on the TV disinterestedly. I'd overestimated the time that I would need to pack the storage room. The pile of stuff had grown in my memory over the years, forgetting that I had once kept everything I owned in a single room. Now I was left with nothing but time to kill until I would join Amy in Portland tomorrow. A few snags in shipping arrangements and her wrapping up some accounts in a responsible manner at the job that she was leaving had delayed things a bit. It had been just over two weeks since we had seen each other.</p>
<p>"Wish you were here." I texted, as I debated going down to the hotel bar. I elected not to, as I didn't want to risk bumping into someone I knew and getting trapped in a long conversation.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah? It wasn't that many years ago that you wouldn't have been caught dead typing those words."</p>
<p>"You were an obnoxious little brat then."</p>
<p>"I was your little brat, though."</p>
<p>"Not at the time."</p>
<p>"You know what I mean."</p>
<p>An image file arrived a moment later. I opened the file and a photo of her back, wearing my dress shirt, taken in a mirror. About two thirds of her majestic ass was visible below the shirt with only the line of a thong obscuring the view. I stared at it for a good ten seconds or so before responding.</p>
<p>"You're trying to make me go sit at the airport all night trying to switch to an earlier flight, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Is it working? Do you like seeing your little brat's ass?"</p>
<p>"You've got me thinking pretty hard about it."</p>
<p>"The flight or my ass?"</p>
<p>"Fuck it. I'm going." I got up and started tossing the very few items I had unpacked back in my bag.</p>
<p>"What? Seriously?" Came the reply.</p>
<p>"Seriously. I'm sitting on my ass doing nothing. If I'm doing the same thing at the airport, then I can maybe get there that much sooner."</p>
<p>"I'll be waiting!"</p>
<p>I grinned when I saw her text and dropped the phone on the bed, while I packed my laptop away. Once everything was packed, I went back down to the front desk and turned my key in to a very perplexed looking hotel employee.</p>
<p>"Was there a problem with the room, Mr. Matheson?" They asked nervously.</p>
<p>"Not at all. I just realized I have somewhere else I need to be." I smiled, as I dialed the number for the cab company.</p>
<p>As I climbed into the cab a few minutes later, my phone vibrated with another message from Amy.</p>
<p>"Hell, if I had known that I only needed to sent a picture of my ass to get you out here, I would have sent it a week ago."</p>
<p>There wasn't an earlier flight. I sat in the damned airport like an asshole all night, doodling in a sketchbook while stuck in an uncomfortable chair. Patience is a virtue. Or something like that. My impatience to be with my sister caused me a very long night of no sleep. But that wasn't the first time that had happened, by any means. The positive side of being up all night in a airport cursing my impulsiveness was that it was daytime in Athens and I was able to answer Damian's emails pretty rapidly.</p>
<p>The four hour flight to Portland was uneventful and felt abnormally short when compared to the fifteen hours I had spent flying in from Athens. Admittedly, I had slept most of it. We had flights booked for Athens from Portland that left in three days, meaning I'd be spending somewhere in the neighborhood of nearly forty hours on planes in less than a week's time. I was not overly enthused about this, and had already depleted the stack of books I had brought with me to read in flight. A trip to a bookstore would be in order sometime in the next few days. When I walked out of the loading ramp into the terminal, I scanned the room for Amy. She was nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>I made it about ten yards into the terminal when I was suddenly attacked in the hundred and ten pound equivalent of a football tackle. Well, I imagine a football game featuring such a tackle would raise more than a few eyebrows, as my attacker wrapped her arms and legs around me and began kissing me with great ferocity. I did my best to return the kisses in kind, while fighting off my laughter. The laughter and smiles of a couple of onlookers seemed to have a slight calming effect on us and I was finally able to get some oxygen back in my lungs.</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>"Miss me?" She asked, out of breath, grinning like a fool when she finally settled down.</p>
<p>"Like you wouldn't believe." I smiled back at her. Amy looked stunning, as always. She was wearing a red shirt and jeans, but she could make even such a simple outfit look sexy as hell.</p>
<p>We collected my luggage and caught a cab to her apartment. Most of the trip was spent with her practically climbing me in the backseat of the cab, kissing my neck, and making me feel a bit like a cat tree. A very horny cat tree.</p>
<p>The shyness that had loomed over both of us when we first reunited in London was long gone now. As soon as we entered the apartment, she locked the door and dropped to her knees in front of me. She grabbed my belt buckle in one hand and found my zipper with her other. She fished my prick out of my pants and gazed at it as she licked her lips. I watched her as she stroked my length in her small hands. Her eyes came up to lock with mine and she gave me a wicked, lust filled smile, just as she tilted her head a little to the side and took me into her mouth. She bobbed up and down rapidly, tilting her head first one direction, then the other as she went adding to the sensations she was giving my length. I moaned as I pulled her hair back from her face, holding it out of her way.</p>
<p>She slowed for two long sensuous strokes, running her tongue along the underside of my shaft as she went, before she moved forward, Adjusting the angle of her throat just a little. I gasped audibly as I felt my cock move past her mouth into her throat. Her lips met with the base of my shaft and she moaned, the vibration in her throat creating a sensation along my cock that made me groan again. She withdrew, clearly pleased with herself, and attempted to smile around my prick in her mouth. I felt her suck in a breath around the side of my dick before she moved back and took me all the way down again. She faltered this time, pulling back to cough a moment and snicker.</p>
<p>"Out of practice," she mumbled as she flashed me a grin, and dove back to her task.</p>
<p>Her mouth swallowed me whole again, without choking. Each time my cock slid into her throat, the sensation nearly overwhelmed me. I fought hard not to grab her head and ram myself into her. A groan escaped my lips periodically, the only sound in the room aside from the wet sounds of her lips on my prick and the light moans she was making herself.</p>
<p>"Oh god, Amy." I gasped. "Keep going."</p>
<p>She didn't reply, but she kept up her ministrations. I could feel my balls tensing up. I'd had my eyes closed without realizing it, and opened them taking in the sight of my beautiful baby sister kneeling before bobbing her head up and down my length. My free hand reached out to the wall for support as I felt the rush building in my groin. She sped up her bobbing, breathing hard through her nose. My hips bucked a little, involuntarily as the first shot of come released in her mouth. She instantly went deep, taking me all the way in and stayed there as long as she could as my cock sent volleys of come deep into her throat. Finally, she pulled back, licking me clean as she went, careful to avoid putting too much pressure on my crown, now sensitive from having just climaxed. She swallowed hard when she released my prick and made sure she had licked it clean.</p>
<p>Amy caught her breath a moment, then smiled warmly up at me. She raised her arms above her head, cocking her head to the side adorably, motioning for me to help her up. I couldn't help grinning widely as I did so. Her arms snaked around my neck, pulling me into a huge hug, which I gladly obliged. Her lips moved up to my ear.</p>
<p>"I had been dying to taste my big brother's come for weeks." She whispered seductively and nibbled my ear. My cock twitched a bit at her words, despite being temporarily out of commission.</p>
<p>I swept her up in my arms, cradling her like a small child and asked.</p>
<p>"Bed?"</p>
<p>She laughed aloud and pointed over her shoulder, "That way."</p>
<p>I paused a moment to kiss her deeply, tasting a little of myself in her mouth. I carried her down the hall, toward where she motioned the bedroom to be. She was kissing and sucking on my neck as I walked, no doubt leaving marks, knowing her. I pushed a door open with my foot and was faced with a bathroom. Part of my brain registered that most of the bathroom was packed into boxes that sat on the floor by the sink, but I really was unconcerned with that detail at the time.</p>
<p>"Oops." I mumbled, and she started chuckling against my throat. I could feel the smile spread across her face.</p>
<p>"Next one."</p>
<p>I carried her to the next room down the hall and saw a bed in it.</p>
<p>"That's more like it." I said aloud and lightly tossed her onto it. She bounced harmlessly on the mattress.</p>
<p>"Hey! Damn it!" She laughed, not even coming close to achieving the annoyed tone I could tell she was trying for.</p>
<p>She sat up on the bed, pulling her shirt over her head and tossing it to the floor. I pulled off my own shirt, as she began unbuttoning her jeans. I stripped to my boxers and saw her still struggling with the jeans that she now had halfway down her hips.</p>
<p>"Little help?" She grinned at me. I chuckled as I grabbed the sides of her pants and tried to pull them off of her, unintentionally lifting her ass from the bed in the process.</p>
<p>"How the fuck do you move in these things?" I asked as I they finally slid down her long slender legs.</p>
<p>"Oh shut it." She smirked and reached behind her back to unhook her bra.</p>
<p>I climbed into the bed just as she dropped the bra. She flung her arms open, beckoning me to her as if I needed an invitation. We wrapped ourselves around each other, her beautiful breasts smashed against my chest, and kissed. I held her to me for a long time, just enjoying that she was back in my arms, before I allowed my hands to wander her body. She had her arms hooked under mine, gripping my shoulders for all she was worth as she ground her pelvis against me. My lips traveled from her mouth to her jaw line, planting kisses up toward her ear. Just as my lips brushed against her ear, she managed to maneuver her pelvis so that my shaft was lined up with her labia and she rocked her hips so that my cock slide, rather unexpectedly along her slit. The incredible sensation cause me to release a sharp gasp right next to her ear and it seemed to drive her wild. She bucked against me, moaning loudly.</p>
<p>"Oh fuck, Adam. I need you!" She cried, as she rolled us until she was on top of me. She jerked her panties down her legs, bringing up one leg to remove them and nearly tumbling herself in the process. I would have laughed at her, if it hadn't made her breasts bounce so deliciously that it filled me with hunger and overwrote the humor or the situation. I raised my hips enough to slide my boxers down and she quickly returned to straddling me, grinding her bare pussy against my semi erect cock. Somewhere in the back of my mind, it registered that she had shaved it again. Unable to resist, I took her breasts in my hands, kneading them, feeling her rock hard nipples against my palms. She moaned her approval, holding one hand over mine against her breast, while the other was flat against my chest.</p>
<p>"I love your hands on me." She breathed.</p>
<p>My uncovered hand toyed with her nipple a moment, before cupping her breast as I leaned forward to kiss it. I kissed her breast in a circle around the nipple before I gave it a swift lick and fastened my lips to it. I sucked her nipple into my mouth, tonguing the hardened nub while my hand snaked around her back and slid down her body.</p>
<p>My erection was rapidly returning and that bit of information was not lost on her. She raised herself up and grabbed my shaft, lining it up with her entrance. Amy lowered herself slowly and I watched as my dick slowly disappeared into the tight folds of my baby sister's flesh. I reflexively held my breath as I had entered her, trying to focus everything I had on enjoying the sensation of her enveloping me. When she was lowered completely, I let out a long breath.</p>
<p>I slid my hands down to cup her ass, and began pulling her against me as we met each others thrusts. She arched her back away from me, her beautiful breasts bouncing as we rocked against each other rhythmically. One of my hands moved around to drag my palm across her stomach, up between her breasts, pausing to rub one of them, before curling around behind her neck and pulling her down meet my lips. We kissed hard, our tongues thrusting into each others mouths, tasting each other as best we were able.</p>
<p>"God I love you," I breathed when we came up for air. She ground herself against me, too busy moaning at the moment to respond. Her breath was coming in hard, ragged gasps. Amy sat back up, and began slamming herself into me harder. I watched in rapt attention as her breasts heaved above me.</p>
<p>Amy's urgent moans increased in tempo and volume as she rocked against me. I slid a hand across her thigh and down to run my thumb across her clit as she arched her back again. The combination of my cock inside her and my thumb on her clitoris was too much and sent her over the edge. Her legs seized around me, vibrating as her stomach rippled with the force of her orgasm. She cried out loudly enough that I was sure half the apartment complex had to have heard her. She collapsed into me, as though she were made of rubber and I cradled her to me, my hard shaft still inside her, while she rode out the aftershocks of her climax.</p>
<p>"You didn't come?" She asked when she regained her senses. Her blue eyes cracked open to lock on to mine.</p>
<p>"Not yet." I replied as I softly stroked her hair.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess your little sister has some work to do, doesn't she?" She grinned wickedly at me.</p>
<p>We woke up late the next morning, neither of us feeling particularly energetic after the night before. Luckily, she was now unemployed and had nowhere she really needed to be that morning. We went to a local cafe for a late breakfast and then returned to her apartment to finish packing things up for the move. I made arrangements with the shipping company and filled out the bill of lading as we went. Shipping things to another country was a pain the ass, I had learned from my experience shipping my own possessions back in Austin. I could not have asked for better company, of course, and did not mind the work in the least.</p>
<p>If I were being totally honest, we probably could have finished up for the day much sooner, if one of us hadn't been distracted by the others ass when she bent to pick up a box and given it an appreciative rub. I refuse to accept responsibility for my actions in that particular situation. There was a magnificent ass in desperate need of a grope and I felt it was my duty to accommodate that need. That rub resulted in a delay that took a couple of hours, although neither of us complained about it. We finally finished packing everything and stacking it in the front room by late afternoon.</p>
<p>A former work colleague of hers came and picked up the bed and some of the living room furniture just before dusk. Neither Amy nor myself felt much need to point out to him just how thoroughly used that bed had been the night before. The apartment had come partially furnished and we made good use of the washer and dryer before packing the sheets away. We'd be staying in a hotel by the airport that night, returning in the morning to meet the shipping company and catching our flight to Athens that afternoon.</p>
<p>Amy balked at me for insisting that she pack a couple of weeks worth of clothes in her luggage for the flight. When I reminded her that it would take at least two weeks for the things we were shipping to arrive, she took my advice and loaded some more things from a box to her luggage. Surveying what she had prepared, I probably shouldn't have said anything. I'd momentarily forgotten the unwritten rule that women felt the need to pack at least four outfits per day for any given outing.</p>
<p>We were both exhausted that night when we got to our hotel room for the night. Our last night in the States for the foreseeable future was spent cuddling in the hotel bed, watching television and occasionally making out.</p>
<p>The following afternoon, still somewhat in shock from seeing the bill for the shipping, I settled in beside Amy on the plane for our fifteen hour flight. She had both of her arms wrapped around one of mine and her head leaning on my shoulder. She leaned in and kissed me on the cheek, excitedly.</p>
<p>"Do you remember the night you first took me to that Italian place?" She asked.</p>
<p>I smiled at the memory. It was the first time we had gone on a real date, the first night we had sex, and the first night we had spent the entire night together as lovers. There had been one of the best nights of my life.</p>
<p>"Of course I remember."</p>
<p>"You told me that night that you wanted to take me somewhere where no one knew us. Someplace we could start over and have our life together, remember?" She smiled.</p>
<p>"Yeah, beautiful. I remember." I brought my hand up and lightly stroked her cheek. She turned her face to nuzzle my palm and sighed happily.</p>
<p>The airline began delivering the safety speech before take off. I watched the rather condescending looking stewardess cut her eyes at each person as she made her way down the aisle of the plane, checking everyone's seat belts. I remembered watching movies in my younger days that always seemed to feature these incredibly attractive stewardesses and reflected momentarily on the fact that most of the ones I'd encountered in the last few months ranged from looking like angry school teachers to my old high school lunch lady. Not a smoking hot one in the bunch. The recording of the safety message wrapped up and the stewardess wandered into the front cabin for a bit.</p>
<p>"The point is, we're doing it." Amy grinned, returning to her conversation. "We're really doing it. There's nothing to keep us apart anymore."</p>
<p>"It was always the plan, baby." I joked, wondering how easily she could elbow me from her current position.</p>
<p>"Well, you certainly took your sweet time about it." She chuckled. I couldn't help chuckling myself.</p>
<p>"I love you." I said, giving her a squeeze.</p>
<p>"I love you, too."</p>
<p>"That wasn't a real plane." Amy commented as we stepped out of the tiny airport in Zefiria. We were both stiff as hell from sitting for most of the day on a flight across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>"You get used to it." I replied as I scanned the parking lot for Margaret.</p>
<p>"Seriously, that was a glorified hang glider. They put us in a slingshot and launched us from Athens."</p>
<p>I started laughing.</p>
<p>"Jesus, brat. We can take the ferry next time if it bothers you that bad. And here I thought you were always the adventurous one."</p>
<p>"I am adventurous. But I at least want a parachute if I'm just gonna be flung in the general direction of my destination instead of being on a plane with two wings and an engine." She was grouchy from the flight and, man, it was showing.</p>
<p>"It had two wings and an engine, Amy." I sighed.</p>
<p>"Okay, an engine not powered by two hamsters and a rubber band."</p>
<p>I pinched the bridge of my nose and hung my head.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna spank you in a minute, I swear."</p>
<p>"Is that a promise?" She wrapped her arms around my waist and grinned up at me. She made it really hard to be annoyed when she pulled her adorable little sister act. She'd had more then twenty years to work on it and she played it to perfection. Especially when she added sexy connotations to the mix.</p>
<p>I brushed the loose strands of her hair from her face as I looked down at her.</p>
<p>"Amy?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?" She was giving me one of her most adorable grins, waiting for the kiss she was expecting.</p>
<p>"Shut the hell up, already." I smirked. Then I kissed her.</p>
<p>We walked a few yards and I spotted Margaret getting out of her car, waving to us. She gave Amy a huge hug and then did the same to me.</p>
<p>"Was it a good flight?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Long flight. As always." I replied, then cut my eyes at Amy. "But the longest part was from Athens to here."</p>
<p>"Shut it, jackass." Amy retorted.</p>
<p>"You're brother and sister alright." Margaret snickered. "Come on, let's get to the house so this lovely girl of yours can get a shower and settle in before dinner."</p>
<p>"Where's Theron?" I asked.</p>
<p>"He had to fly back to London with Damian to meet with some big art buyer. He'll be back in a couple of days." Margaret replied as we loaded the luggage in the trunk.</p>
<p>We drove a few minutes and I spotted the coast. I nudged Amy and pointed to the bay.</p>
<p>"Wow. You weren't kidding. It's beautiful!" She exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Just wait, this is the view from the cheap seats." I replied, grinning.</p>
<p>We got to the house and I showed her the apartment. She walked through the rather small place and grinned widely at me.</p>
<p>"You like it?" I said, mildly surprised.</p>
<p>"I get to spend every night with you from now on. We have our own place and there's nothing to keep us apart. You really think I care about anything else?" She asked, still grinning.</p>
<p>"Well, when you're thinking more practically about it, you might. But I like the direction you're taking it." I chuckled as she came over to give me a huge hug.</p>
<p>"I think we'll be just fine." She smiled. "Now about that shower?"</p>
<p>"Right through there." I pointed. "Unlike your old apartment, you can't mistake this one for the bedroom."</p>
<p>"You could have fucked me in the bathroom all you wanted. I wouldn't care." She shot me a sultry look as she grabbed her toiletries bag and walked into the bathroom.</p>
<p>I sat on the edge of the bed and looked over the three room apartment. It really was going to be too small for us. She may think she didn't care, but the entire apartment was only about the size of our two childhood bedrooms smashed together. I wasn't entirely sure at this moment how much money had I had because pieces had been selling fairly steadily in London for the past three weeks. I knew it was enough to be able to afford to rent the house down the block, which was much larger than this tiny apartment. There should be more than enough left over to give Amy to invest for us. I'd take her by there tomorrow and let her look over the place, I thought.</p>
<p>I didn't try to join her in the shower, because there was no possible way we would both fit in the tiny stall. When she came out of the bathroom a few minutes later, she had on a pair of bikini cut panties and a towel draped over her shoulders, covering her breasts. I let out a low breath, and she picked up on it.</p>
<p>"You approve?" She chuckled.</p>
<p>"Oh, I most certainly approve." I nodded. "You look sexy as hell like that, baby."</p>
<p>She blushed a little and gave me one of her arsenal of heart stopping smiles.</p>
<p>"You should take your shower, so we can meet Margaret for dinner."</p>
<p>"I know." I said, without moving or taking my eyes off of her. She walked over to me and put her hand under my chin, tilting my head up to look at her. Her smile was radiant.</p>
<p>"Hold me a moment?" She asked.</p>
<p>I obliged, wrapping my arms around her, my face pressed against her stomach. She hugged me back for a long moment, before she finally released me.</p>
<p>"I'm not going anywhere, baby." She cooed. "Go take a shower. We have all the time in the world now."</p>
<p>She was right, and for whatever reason, it clicked into place in my brain more than saying it over the past couple of days had before. I felt another layer of weight lift of my shoulders that I hadn't even realized was still there.</p>
<p>"Don't get me wrong. I adore it when you look at me like that. So don't ever stop, okay?"</p>
<p>"Not a chance, beautiful." I grinned as I stood to go to the shower. I made it about three steps before I spun around and pulled her back to me, my erection pressing against her ass. She yelped playfully, until my hand cupped one of her breasts under her towel and gave it a gentle squeeze. Her breathing became a little heavier. I released it and headed for the shower.</p>

<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>"That's not fair, damn it. You know what you do to me." She growled without malice.</p>
<p>I chuckled as I turned the shower on and started stripping, curious to see if she was going to try to wedge herself in the tiny stall with me after all. She didn't.</p>
<p>Later, over dinner, I asked Margaret if she thought Theron would mind if I borrowed his boat in the morning.</p>
<p>"Of course not. You know better by now." She admonished me.</p>
<p>"I still prefer to ask." I replied, grinning.</p>
<p>"We're going boating?" Amy asked.</p>
<p>"Yep. You pack a suit?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I have a couple actually. You said there were a lot of beaches here. I figured if they were nice enough to get you out of your hermit cave mindset and into the sun, then they must be pretty awesome." She smirked.</p>
<p>"They're better." I replied.</p>
<p>"I must say, it's going to be nice not being the only woman around here." Margaret smiled.</p>
<p>"Oh? My brother's been a pain in the ass? Can't say I'm surprised." Amy stuck her tongue out at me.</p>
<p>"Certainly not. Adam has been nothing but a perfect guest."</p>
<p>"Jesus, it's getting deep in here." I picked up my empty plate, took it to the kitchen and started loading the dishwasher.</p>
<p>"See? Perfect guest." Margaret chuckled motioning toward me to Amy.</p>
<p>"I don't think I've ever seen him willingly load a dishwasher in his life." Amy commented. I gave her the finger over my shoulder.</p>
<p>"You already owe me a spanking, are you just making a to-do list now?"</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes and kept loading the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Amy walked into the kitchen and started doing the larger dishes in the sink. She bumped me with a hip and smiled at me as I rinsed the pots she'd just scrubbed. I gave her a grin of my own.</p>
<p>Later that night, I crawled into bed. Amy stripped to her panties and one of my shirts she'd grabbed from the closet, then joined me. As she cuddled up next to me, she smiled warmly.</p>
<p>"Every night." She sighed, sleepily but elated. I couldn't disagree.</p>
<p>The next day, I took a blanket, a couple of towels, and a couple of zip ties. I slipped them all into a heavy garbage bag, pressed them down enough to minimize the air a bit, and used another zip tie to seal it. I loaded a wooden wine box with a bottle of wine that I'd purchased before I went to the States in anticipation, a couple of glasses, and some fresh fruit. I made a couple of sandwiches in the kitchen, wrapped them up and added them to the box as well.</p>
<p>Amy came into the kitchen wearing blue bikini with a pair of shorts over the bottoms. She had her long, black hair pulled up in a ponytail, and I took the opportunity to kiss her exposed neck for a moment.</p>
<p>"Mm..." She moaned lightly in approval. I wrapped my arms around her bare waist and gave her a squeeze just as my phone's alarm chirped.</p>
<p>"We gotta get moving." I mumbled.</p>
<p>"What's the rush? I thought we could relax until London on Friday?" She asked, puzzled. I needed to go back to London for an interview with a German art magazine that Damian had set up.</p>
<p>"There's a boat from Adamas that passes around the island soon. I want to avoid it." I said, cryptically.</p>
<p>"Avoid it?" She raised an eyebrow at me.</p>
<p>"You'll see." I grinned as I grabbed the wooden wine crate and trash bag.</p>
<p>"The hell are you up to?" She followed me down toward the beach.</p>
<p>"You'll see."</p>
<p>"Whoa." She whispered suddenly.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"This is amazing." She motioned to the large white volcanic rock formations we were approaching as we got closer to the water.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah. They're beautiful, aren't they?" I smiled, enjoying watching her sense of wonder. "There's a few I'll show you that I enjoy diving from. And, the beaches on the other side of the island have these boulders that look almost like earth toned rainbows or something. I've been told it's because of the mineral deposits, but they are pretty awesome to check out, too."</p>
<p>A few minutes later, as I loaded the boat, she said. "You weren't kidding. The water is so blue."</p>
<p>The Aegean Sea was calm, as usual. The beautiful blue water lapping at the mostly stone beach. I motioned her into the boat and once she was settled, I shoved off, climbing in behind her. I smiled to myself watching as she put her hand up to shield her eyes from the sun and peered at the coastline. Ever the artist, I found myself studying the sensual curve of her back as I paddled. I watched the way her ponytail moved across her back when she would turn her head to look at the different rocks and beaches that I paddled us by. I was fascinated by the way her muscles moved on her back and sides when she would turn to continue watching things that caught her eye as we passed them. I certainly noticed the curve of her breasts that would come into view periodically when she turned far enough to expose the sides of her bikini. Goddamn, she's beautiful, I thought to myself.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of me paddling in silence, I glanced up from her back and noticed her looking over her shoulder at me.</p>
<p>"What is it?" She asked, smiling sweetly at me. Busted. Not that I thought she'd mind.</p>
<p>"Just looking at you." I grinned, a little self conscious.</p>
<p>"Well, just don't paddle us into a rock or anything, okay?" A smirk crept across my sister's lips.</p>
<p>"If you only knew," I chuckled, knowing what was coming.</p>
<p>"If I only knew what?"</p>
<p>"You'll see. It's a surprise." I kept paddling, purposely being cryptic. She squinted back at me for a moment, debating if she wanted to push the issue. She let her eyes gaze down at the sapphire blue water. Even though I knew from experience that the water where we currently were was at least thirty or forty feet deep, you could see the bottom clearly.</p>
<p>"Do they have many shark attacks here?" She asked, suddenly. I started laughing, remembering when I'd asked Theron the same thing.</p>
<p>"Not at all. In fact, from everything I've been told, there aren't any sharks here."</p>
<p>"You don't have to make fun of me over it, asshole." Amy replied, sounding a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>"It's not that. I was laughing because I asked Theron the same question the first time he took me out here fishing."</p>
<p>"Oh!" She brightened again.</p>
<p>We paddled along huge cliffs made of the same white volcanic rock back by the house. The island really was a stunning place.</p>
<p>"You see those caves along the cliff?" I asked.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"There's dozens of them along the beaches. One guy in Plaka told me there's more than a hundred."</p>
<p>"Wow. That's pretty crazy."</p>
<p>I paddled us over to the section of cliff I had been looking for, near a cave entrance that was almost at water level. There was no way that a person could paddle through it in a boat, although the boat itself would fit. I pulled the paddle out of the water and set it in the boat.</p>
<p>"Here we are." I announced, and grinned at her puzzled expression.</p>
<p>"Why here?" Amy asked.</p>
<p>Instead of replying, I stood and dove in the cool water. I swam underwater to the front of the boat where she was perched and came up for air next to her. She was looking down at me like I was an amusing idiot.</p>
<p>"Lay back," I told her.</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" She cocked an eyebrow at me.</p>
<p>"Lay down, so you're level with the boat. Unless you wanna crack your head open." I repeated, thumbing over my shoulder at the rocks. I swam to the front of the boat and grabbed the tow line.</p>
<p>Amy looked up at the cave entrance and back at me, suddenly figuring out what I was planning.</p>
<p>"We're going in there?"</p>
<p>"Yep." I grinned, wiping away the sea water that had pooled in my eyebrows.</p>
<p>"Why do you have to pick the hardest one to get into?" She asked as she laid back on the trash bag.</p>
<p>"Believe me, there are some much harder." I replied as I pulled the boat into the crevice.</p>
<p>It slide through the entrance, just barely scraping on one side because I had the angle just a little off. The roof of the entrance glided over Amy's head and I saw her raise a hand to brush against it like a little kid would do. It made me smile. About ten feet into the cave, the passage widened into a pool. The only illumination seemed to come from the water itself as the sun spilled in from the cave entrance, giving the water a glowing blue green look. Shadows from the water rippled across the cave walls.</p>
<p>Amy sat up and looked around with a sense of wonder that I hadn't seen on her face since our parents took us to Disney World as kids. I smiled at the memory. I couldn't help feeling pleased with myself for having blown her mind by showing her this place.</p>
<p>"Holy shit, Adam!" She exclaimed as I pulled the boat up to the bank.</p>
<p>"I know. Pretty bad ass, isn't it?" I pulled myself out of the water onto the rocks and extended a hand to her. She took my hand and stepped out of the boat, nodding her head as she did so.</p>
<p>"A couple of months after I first moved here I got curious about the caves. Mostly just to kill time." She didn't look like she was listening to me, but I continued. "Anyway, this was maybe the sixth or seventh one I went into."</p>
<p>"It's so beautiful!" She continued gazing around. I wasn't entirely sure she had blinked yet.</p>
<p>I stepped over to her and settled my hands on the swell of her hips. Her eyes moved over to meet mine.</p>
<p>"You're more beautiful, though." I said quietly, hoping the over saturated, clearly calculated line would crack her up.</p>
<p>"Laying it on a little thick there, aren't you big brother?" She chuckled up at me. Her eyes were shimmering, though. Regardless of the silly level of over reaching I'd gone for with the compliment in a weak attempt at humor, some of the truth behind it had hit home for her.</p>
<p>"Hey, I spent the last three years wanting to bring you here and show you this place. Cut me a little slack if I overplay my hand, eh?" I grinned.</p>
<p>"Three years, huh? That's a long time to wait to make your move."</p>
<p>"I knew this girl once that took something like nineteen years to make her move."</p>
<p>"Well, at least she made one. Just think where they would be otherwise." She brought hand up and ran it through my wet hair.</p>
<p>"I'd rather not." I leaned in and kissed her. Her hands reached down and unbuttoned her shorts, letting them fall to the ground, leaving her in just her bikini.</p>
<p>She pressed herself up against me as she returned my kiss. After a few moments, she glanced at the stone cave floor and back up at me.</p>
<p>"Didn't I see you pack a blanket?" She asked.</p>
<p>I went to the boat and pulled out the stuff we'd brought. Amy walked around the perimeter of the room, exploring a little while I retrieved Theron's fishing knife from the boat and cut the zip ties from the trash bag. By the time she got done wandering, I had the blanket laid out and poured her a glass of wine.</p>
<p>"I thought you didn't like wine?" She smiled down where I was crouched.</p>
<p>"I don't particularly, but you do." I offered up the glass to her.</p>
<p>She nodded as she sat down next to me and put her free hand on my leg while she took a drink. Setting the glass down, she wrapped her arms around me in a big hug and pushed me back on the blanket.</p>
<p>"You taste salty." She licked her lips.</p>
<p>"I just climbed out of sea water, I can't imagine why." I found myself distracted by her cleavage.</p>
<p>"Damn it." She breathed.</p>
<p>"What?" I glanced back up into her eyes.</p>
<p>"I feel like I'm going to melt when you look at me like that." She said, bashfully.</p>
<p>"Sorry?" I offered.</p>
<p>"Don't even think of being sorry. Just come here and do whatever it was you were thinking of doing to me just now." Her lips curled upward in a sultry smile.</p>
<p>"Right this second, or what I've been thinking of doing to you here since I found this place?"</p>
<p>"Why not both?"</p>
<p>"I had years to think about it, it might take a while if I went with the second option. But we aren't in a rush, I guess." I replied, sliding a hand over one of the cups of her bikini top. She arched her back up against my palm.</p>
<p>"Start with 'just this second' then, we'll work on the rest later." She whispered. I leaned down and licked the flesh between her breasts, causing her to suck a breath of air in anticipation. Placing a palm just above her stomach, I slid it upward between her breasts, under the bikini top, raising my thumb to catch the string and pull her top up. Her breasts slid free of the material with a satisfying jiggle. I smiled appreciatively, admiring the view. Her nipples were hardening and I slid a thumb over the nearest one watching as it responded to my touch.</p>
<p>I cupped both of both of my hands around the breast nearest to me, and planted kisses in a circle around her nipple slowly. She arched toward me again, one of her hands coming up to wrap around her other breast. I sucked her nipple into my mouth, pulling it with my lips, and slid my far hand over to take over for her on the other breast. She purred and cradled my upper body to her breast with her arms.</p>
<p>"Do you like my breasts, baby?" She asked sweetly, already knowing the answer.</p>
<p>"I love them," I breathed.</p>
<p>"Do you love sucking your baby sister's nipples, dear brother?" She asked in a lower, more seductive voice.</p>
<p>"You know I do, dear sister." I replied, playing her relation game, something I rarely gave voice to.</p>
<p>"They're yours forever, my brother. Always and forever. Like every other part of me that I can give you. Yours forever, my love." She breathed out in almost a whisper. Whimpering in reaction to my touch.</p>
<p>I moved up even with her face, moved to my core by her words, and kissed her as deeply and passionately as I was able. Trying to express my love for her that I always felt was beyond my ability to say or show to her. This was no exception. There were no words, no act, that could do the job to my satisfaction. Our lips parted after a time and I looked deeply into her piercing, beautiful blue eyes.</p>
<p>"You are everything to me, Amy. Everything. I am so lucky to have you in my life, beautiful. I love you more than anything." My voice wavered a little with emotion.</p>
<p>I saw her eyes start to well up, but she moved up to place her mouth over mine before any tears fell. We shared another long, meaningful kiss. When we broke for air, she smiled up at me as she wiped a tear from the corner of her eye with the back of a hand.</p>
<p>"So, you're going to keep me forever?" She asked. Surely, she knew the answer, but I'd play along.</p>
<p>"Even longer, if I could."</p>
<p>"That sounds perfect to me." Amy smiled, as I kissed the corner of her mouth and made my way down to her neck. My lips moved over her body lightly grazing over her skin and stopping to plant kisses strategically along the way. I worked my way down to her nipples again, spending plenty of time with each nipple, then down between her breasts and under each of them. The appreciative moans above me, assured me that my efforts were having the desired effect. My hands slid down and untied the strings on either side of her bikini bottoms.</p>
<p>"Damn, these things are convenient." I mumbled.</p>
<p>Amy broke out in a giggle. "I'll remember to wear them more often."</p>
<p>I flipped the bikini bottoms down and gave her a long light lick. She gasped above me. Her hand shot down and snatched one of mine, pulling it up and over her breast. I paused, raising my head to look at her. Her eyes shown down at me, the reflection from the water rippled shadows across her beautiful, nude form. I was, without question in my mind, the luckiest guy on the planet. My free hand slid over her mound, grazing over her entrance. Her eyes closed and she let out a slight whimper. I dropped my head back down and began to lap at her slowly. Her body responded, her stomach fluttering, as her breath quickened.</p>
<p>Her legs widened, trying to allow me more access. I slipped my tongue between the folds of her flesh, lapping up her secretions, enjoying how I would lick her clean only to be rewarded with a fresh wash of her nectar as soon as I probed deeper. She was moaning heavily above me now, her hips rocking back and forth in small motions.</p>
<p>"Oh god, baby, don't stop." She breathed, a whimper sliding out of her at the end of her sentence like a punctuation.</p>
<p>I had no intention of stopping. I continued to lick her, sliding my free hand up to tease at the hood of her clitoris. My other hand, extended somewhat uncomfortably above me, continued to massage her breast while she kept both of her hands clasped tightly over it. Her hips seemed to be almost vibrating, as she struggled not to buck them into me. Amy's cries above me were becoming more shrill and increasingly urgent. I raised my head slightly and planted a kiss on her clit, lapping at it gently with my tongue. I began using my tongue as a pen to spell out my love for her, tracing the letters individually across her clit. She drew her knees up suddenly, locking them on each side of my face, as her hands flew to the side and each balled up into a fist grabbing a handful of blanket. Her back arched high as her stomach and thighs quivered violently. Even with my ears covered tightly by her thighs, I could hear her orgasmic scream of release echoing off the walls of the cave. I almost cracked a grin as my tongue plunged as deep into my little sister as I could, but not moving for fear of overstimulating her. I hadn't thought of the echoes, not once in all the times I'd fantasized of bringing her here.</p>
<p>Gradually, she lowered back to the blanket and relaxed her thighs, releasing my head from the death grip she'd had on it. I scooted up beside her and laid down as she gasped for air, still shuddering from the aftershocks of her huge orgasm. After a moment, she cuddled up against me, draping a naked thigh across me as she laid her head on my chest. Her hand came up to rest on my chest beneath her chin.</p>
<p>"You are so amazing, baby." She murmured against my chest as she started kissing my chest all over. Her hand slid down and unzipped my shorts. I raised my ass a little, allowing her to slide them down my legs.</p>
<p>She climbed on top of me, straddling my erection, and rocked her hips sliding her pussy over my hard cock. I moaned slightly at the sensation. She withdrew and repeated the move a second time before raising herself to position my cock head at her warm entrance.</p>
<p>Amy let out a loud groan as she lowered, impaling herself on my throbbing erection. I lost myself in the feeling of my dick disappearing into her glistening folds. Seeing her sitting upright, riding me, was something I found endlessly erotic. The blue and green light coming from the water cast shadows that rhythmically rolled across her body like spiderwebs. I loved watching the way I slid in and out of her. She moaned appreciatively as my hands slid up to massage her creamy breasts that were bouncing deliciously above me.</p>
<p>"I love your hands on me," she groaned, putting a hand over one of mine, pressing it to her breast harder. Her free hand moved up to her scalp, gliding through her hair as she tossed her head back guiding her hair out of her face. My cock, finding her impossible to resist, lurched in response to the sexy vision above me. I slid a hand down to her hip, resting there a moment, before gliding it over to rub her clit lightly with my thumb. She let out a loud moan, loud enough to echo off of the walls of the cave again in response.</p>
<p>"God, I love you," I breathed. A smile cracked through the gasps she was releasing above me, as her half closed lids gazed downward at me. She rolled forward, her soft breasts smashing into my chest, as she began planting kisses on my jaw as she put her mouth up to my ear whispering my words back to me.</p>
<p>I cupped her ass in one of my hands while my other was across her back, holding her against me. My mouth worshiped her neck and shoulders with kisses, causing her to gasp when I touched on her favorites spots. I thrust my hips up into her, listening to her rhythmic panting above me. I don't think there was a more erotic sound in the world.</p>
<p>"So good..." I heard my sister moan, as I tightened my grip on her incredible ass and thrust deeper into her. Gripping her against me, I rolled her onto her back and she immediately wrapped her legs around my waist, digging her heels into my thighs. My shaft moved in and out of her like a piston as her fingers dug into my shoulders.</p>

<p>She cried aloud, her voice booming through the cavern yet again, as her body rushed toward a second orgasm. Amy began writhing uncontrollably beneath me, mewling unintelligible cries of ecstasy. Her vagina pulsed around my cock as her orgasm hit her. She bucked her quivering thighs into me as hard as she could, vibrating throughout her body. It was so fucking hot to see the effect I had on her that my balls emptied themselves, sending rocket streams of semen out of my dick into her body. The force of my orgasm caused triggered another in her and we both cried out, locked tightly together in rapturous release.</p>
<p>We collapsed into each other, sweating and gasping for breath. Once I was able to breathe normally, I kissed her tenderly, cradling my beautiful, little sister in my arms.</p>
<p>"Wow." She said softly. "That was incredible."</p>
<p>I nodded my agreement, kissing her forehead and leaving my lips there for a while. I glanced up at the shadows playing across the cavern walls and reflected a moment on the realization that my wish to make love to her here had been fulfilled. My eyes traveled back down to the beautiful creature in my arms.</p>
<p>"Have I ever bothered to mention that you are the most amazing, beautiful thing I have ever seen?" I asked, knowing damned well that I had.</p>
<p>"You may have mentioned it once or twice, but you can tell me again. I don't mind." She flushed a little as she grinned up at me.</p>
<p>"Well, it's true, sweetheart. I can never find the words to tell you how much I love you. It pisses me off. You make me feel more..." I paused, trying to find the words, annoyed because I felt my eyes clouding a little at the emotions I was trying to express. "at peace, I guess... comfortable with myself maybe... than I've ever felt in my life. You are all I need, Amy. You are the only thing that truly matters to me. I don't fucking deserve you."</p>
<p>"You, my dear brother, are the love of my life." She whispered, smiling softly at me as her hand stroked my cheek. "And you totally deserve me. I'm yours forever."</p>
<p>"That makes me happier than you can ever imagine." My lips met hers in a long, loving kiss.</p>
<p>"Even if you took me to your secret hideaway and fucked me there like you are some sort of creepy cave troll." Her eyes twinkled at me.</p>
<p>"You brat. This place is fucking beautiful and you know it. I could have brought any girl here and her panties would hit the floor like an anvil." I deadpanned. "The only thing I could have done to make this more romantic is candles and rose petals."</p>
<p>"You cheated me out of rose petals, you bastard? How dare you..." She smirked, before latching onto me with a huge kiss.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright. I'll bring rose petals next time." I chuckled.</p>
<p>We lay together in each others arms for a while longer, dozing contentedly, until we decided it was time to clean up. I lead her into the water and we washed each others bodies in the water, pausing often to cuddle into each other in a hug. Eventually we got dressed again and she lay back in the boat as I pulled it back out of the cave entrance into the bay. I climbed back aboard and paddled us around the island while she lay back getting some sun and purposely allowing me to look over her wonderful body to my heart's content. We talked and laughed and relished in the knowledge that this was our new reality. Finally, as the sun was beginning to retreat for the day, we headed back to the apartment. Amy marveled at watching the sunset over the Aegean Sea.</p>
<p>One early afternoon a few weeks later, I walked over to Theron's studio from our rent house to continue working on my newest painting. I had just gotten word from Damian that it was confirmed that I would be having a show in Tokyo this coming December. Amy would be ecstatic to get to see Japan. Hell, I was excited to see Japan.</p>
<p>Theron was out fishing this afternoon, so I had the studio to myself and decided to make full use of the sound system that was in the corner. Most of the time, I was back to using headphones so that I wouldn't disturb anyone. Amy and Margaret had gone out for a walk on the beach. I picked an album that felt appropriate, smiling contentedly as the sound filled the room, and got to work on the painting.</p>
<p>A few songs later, the girls came wandering into the studio. Amy was wearing a white bikini that accentuated her beautiful body and had a floral sash tied around her waist like a skirt. She came up to me, giving me a big hug and a quick kiss. She listened to the song that was playing for a moment and smiled.</p>
<p>"What is this? This is really catchy." She asked.</p>
<p>"The song's called 'No Crimes.' It's pretty great."</p>
<p>"Yeah, it really is." She agreed, and started to dance around the room, grinning widely. She looked so beautiful and happy.</p>
<p>"Come on, dance with me." She called to Margaret, knowing full well that I was not a dancer by any stretch of the imagination. I chuckled to myself as the two of them playfully danced around the studio.</p>
<p>I went back to looking at the painting in front of me. Some of the lyrics stuck in my head on a loop, as the song kept going.</p>
<p>"All you ever wanted</p>
<p>All you ever need</p>
<p>Your brand new history"</p>
<p>This happened sometimes when I was painting, and focusing on snippets of lines that resonated with me just added to the mood I hoped to convey. The song repeated the lyrics over and over as it came to a close. Amy danced with Margaret, both of them smiling and laughing as I watched, smiling from behind my canvas. The sun shown through the window casting a long shadow from my baby sister's beautiful bikini clad body as I watched her move gracefully to and fro around the room. Sometimes the perfect song at the perfect time can say more than you ever can on your own, I thought to myself. Amy looked over at me as she danced, her eyes as blue as the sea, and smiled warmly. I smiled reflexively in return, and silently mouthed the words "I love you."</p>
<p>The End.</p>
