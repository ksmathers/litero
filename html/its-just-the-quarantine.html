<h1>Chapter 0</h1>

<p>Two near-strangers find themselves having to share an apartment during quarantine. Their growing mutual attraction is clearly just the isolation getting to them, right? Right?!</p>
<p>Anika had rarely been so frustrated. At this precise moment, she was supposed to be on an airplane, flying back to Amsterdam. Just a few hours ago, everything had bene lined up perfectly. She had reached a stopping point in her thesis work, had sent messages to her family and boyfriend, had packed up everything. And after her initial flight on Saturday was cancelled, she'd managed to get a seat on a Friday flight. Going home a day early!</p>
<p>And then, just as she was almost at the airport, she got a text. Thanks to travel ban, her flight was cancelled.</p>
<p>Now she was trudging up the stairs to her apartment, sweaty, tired, angry and worried that she might have been exposed during her cab ride. Her trip home was postponed, and, by the look of things, it might be a long time before she could reschedule. She was stuck in New York. And while she loved the city, she did not want to wait out the pandemic there.</p>
<p>She finally reached the small apartment she shared with Rachel. Rachel had gone home a week ago when spring break began. But the University was now going fully remote and Rachel was almost certain to stay home. Anika sighed in resignation as she unlocked the door, knowing she was about to be alone for a long long time.</p>
<p>She got into the tiny entry and closed the door. And as she put down the bag, she was overwhelmed with a feeling of uncleanliness. She'd been out there, in the world, getting heaven knows what on her clothing. She quickly began to strip. Her short skirt hit the floor, her blouse followed. She even unleashed her bra, leaving her in nothing but her panties. For a moment, she felt a little better, like she had shed off the outside world and could be herself.</p>
<p>She got the phone out of her purse. As she crossed the living room, heading toward the hallway and the bathroom to take a shower, she texted Rachel.</p>
<p>You are not going to believe what just happened to me?</p>
<p>My fucking flight was cancelled! I'm stuck here!</p>
<p>That's awful! What are you going to do?</p>
<p>I'm guess I'm going to have to wait things out in the apartment.</p>
<p>That sucks. Are you on your way back?</p>
<p>I'm already back. Going to wash up just to be safe.</p>
<p>Well, say Hi to Adam for me.</p>
<p>Anika froze in the hallway.</p>
<p>"Shit," she said.</p>
<p>In all the chaos, she had forgotten about Rachel's brother. He was up in New York for a job interview and to hunt for a place to live. They had agreed to let him use the apartment while they were away. She'd even taken her valuables with her just to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>Her eyes drifted rightward toward the bedroom. She gasped.</p>
<p>A strange man -- presumably Rachel's brother -- was lying asleep in one of the beds.</p>
<p>Time stood still. She wasn't sure what she should do. Then she heard a ringtone from Adam's phone beside the bed. He flailed for the phone, lifted his head up and glanced at it. Then he sat bolt upright and slowly turned toward her.</p>
<p>For a second, they stared at each other. Adam wondered if he was dreaming this vision of a curvaceous woman with reddish-blond hair and bright blue eyes clad in nothing but a pair of bikini panties. Even with the shock, he couldn't help but notice her.</p>
<p>Anika was a bit less impressed by his slightly pudgy physique. Her eyes widened a bit at the sizable disposition between his legs before it processed that the reason she could see it was because he didn't have a single stitch on.</p>
<p>With mutual cries, they moved. Adam covered up his crotch with a pillow. Anika's hands flew to cover her breasts, a task to which they were somewhat inadequate. She turned and scampered into the bathroom and slammed the door.</p>
<p>Shit shit shit shit.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>I totally forgot your brother was staying here.</p>
<p>Oh, he's not bad. A little dorky, definitely. But he's a good guy. You're perfectly safe with him.</p>
<p>That's not what I meant. I mean I forgot. So I walked in on him naked.</p>
<p>OMG!</p>
<p>And I was heading toward the shower so I was almost naked too!</p>
<p>OMG! OMG! LOL</p>
<p>I feel so humiliated!</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I shouldn't laugh. I know it must be humiliating. But I can't help it.</p>
<p>This is not the way I wanted to meet your family!</p>
<p>You've met him before.</p>
<p>Well, I don't remember him.</p>
<p>I'm sure you will now. A great story to tell your grandkids Hahaha. }:)</p>
<p>Not funny, Rachel!</p>
<p>Anika stood over the sink and looked at herself in the mirror, a thousand thoughts buzzing through her head. She had no idea what she was supposed to do now. But she knew she couldn't go back out into the apartment. Not with him there. Not with ...</p>
<p>She realized her clothes were still in the hallway. All she had in the bathroom was a washcloth.</p>
<p>She jumped when there was a gentle knock on the door.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" she barked, more harshly than she intended.</p>
<p>"You're Anika, right? I'm sorry about that. I thought there was no one here."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>"Look, I ... I brought your clothes over. I can just leave them outside the door and go into the bedroom if you want."</p>
<p>Anika felt her embarrassment diminish slightly but only slightly.</p>
<p>"I don't want to wear those. I wore them outside."</p>
<p>"Oh. Well, yeah. That's why I was, uh ... well, you know. I'll put them in the laundry. Do you want me to bring you something else?"</p>
<p>Anika didn't like the idea of him going through her clothes.</p>
<p>"I could use a towel."</p>
<p>A moment. And then another knock.</p>
<p>"I'll just leave it out here and go into the hallway."</p>
<p>"Ok. Thanks."</p>
<p>She heard his footsteps move away and then the door close. She opened the door cautiously, grabbed the towel and wrapped it around her body. Then she hurried into the bedroom. She quickly found a minimizer bra and the baggiest sweater and sweat pants she could.</p>
<p>She hesitated a bit. She really didn't want to let ... for a moment, she was so flustered she couldn't remember his name ... Adam, that was it ... back in. But she supposed she had little choice. She opened the apartment door and then stepped back defensively into the living room.</p>
<p>Adam stepped in, looking mortified.</p>
<p>"I'm really-"</p>
<p>"I heard you the first time. It's not your fault."</p>
<p>"Look, this is your place. I can understand if after ..." He waved his hand vaguely toward the bedroom. " ... you don't feel comfortable with me around here. You guys only agreed to give me the place because you thought you'd be away. I'll get a hotel or something and ..."</p>
<p>He looked down at his feet. His obvious embarrassment made Anika feel a little better. She didn't feel comfortable with the idea of sharing the apartment with him for even a few days; especially not after their mutual exposure. But seeing his genuine awkwardness about it made her heart soften a bit.</p>
<p>"It's not safe to be in a hotel right now. I can't let you endanger your life."</p>
<p>He looked up. "Oh ... well, that's ... look, I promise I'll stay out of your way. You won't even know I'm here."</p>
<p>"It's a one-bedroom apartment."</p>
<p>"I'll sleep on the couch or something. I'm not going to be here long, after all."</p>
<p>Anika nodded. "I guess that's OK."</p>
<p>Her phone buzzed. Anika glanced down at it.</p>
<p>I know it's weird but please give him a chance. Blame me for what happened.</p>
<p>I'd like to. But I'm really blaming myself.</p>
<p>That's the spirit!</p>
<p>"So maybe we just ... pretend that didn't happen?" said Adam.</p>
<p>Anika nodded slowly. She didn't think she actually could pretend it didn't happen; she was still a bit weirded out. But she could pretend to pretend. And least for a few days.</p>
<p>"I guess so."</p>
<p>"I'm honestly not a bad guy, I swear. If I had known-"</p>
<p>"It's OK. I mean it's not OK but ... just stop bringing it up," she said, with a slight grin that made Adam's heart lift a bit. Now that the shock was gone, she was kind of cute. And even her baggy clothes couldn't erase the memory of the curvaceous figure he's glimpsed.</p>
<p>He smiled. "I think I can do that."</p>
<p>That night, Anika tossed and turned in bed. She really didn't like the idea of sharing an apartment with any man, let alone Rachel's brother. She'd only known him for a few hours but Rachel's assessment of him was right: He was a dork. And, although he wasn't being obvious about it, he couldn't seem to take his eyes off her.</p>
<p>She knew her own behavior that evening had not been great. She'd been short with him and refused to engage in the conversations he'd tried to start. The more she thought about it tough, the more she felt her embarrassment begin to fade. What had happened earlier wasn't anyone's fault, just a stupid accident brought on by an unusual circumstance. It wasn't like no man had ever seen her naked before. And he'd treated her like a gentleman ever since, not even making a wisecrack about it.</p>
<p>She realized that she was just frustrated with the whole situation and she was harboring some resentment toward him because ... well, because he was there. And she needed to be angry at somebody. And that realization settled her spirit. She resolved to be a little nicer to him the next day and then fell into a decent if uneasy sleep.</p>
<p>Out on the couch, Adam tossed and turned as well, and not just because the couch was too small for him. He couldn't get the image of Anika out of his mind. He'd met her very briefly a year ago, but she didn't seem to remember him. And he didn't remember her being so pretty. Of course, she'd been wearing clothes on that occasion. Even though it had only been a few hours, he was finding her likable, on the rare occasions he could elicit more than two words out of her. And when her dour demeanor gave way to a tiny smile or a little laugh, it was like the sun coming out.</p>
<p>He kicked himself for what had happened earlier. She was being diplomatic but he knew she wanted him out. She disliked him, he was sure. And his experience was that you never got a second chance to make a first impression with a woman. He knew any chance had been remote to begin with; she had mentioned her boyfriend Max back in Amsterdam within the first few minutes of conversation. Despite Rachel's text messages assuring I'm that everything was fine, he knew he was going to spend a few days trapped in an apartment with a pretty girl who wanted nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>Within a few days, however, it was clear that Adam would not be moving out right away. After a few days of futilely trying to find another place to stay, the city was locked down. Adam's employer had met with him briefly, hired him and immediately shifted him to work-from-home, processing economic data for investment decisions.</p>
<p>That evening, they sat down to dinner and laid out the situation.</p>
<p>"I'm finishing my PhD," said Anika. "But I've done almost all the lab work. So I can work from home."</p>
<p>"What are you studying?"</p>
<p>"Viruses, actually, if you can believe it. But ... different ones."</p>
<p>"So I just need to be able to set at my computer and work in peace and quiet."</p>
<p>"That's what I need too."</p>
<p>She looked around. "How about ... I'll take the living room. And you take that little dining area. We'll screen it off with sheets. That way, it's like we're ..."</p>
<p>"Not in the same place," concluded Adam glumly.</p>
<p>"So there's no chance that you'll be able to go back home," he said.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"I shouldn't have tried anyway. I'm high-risk. If I caught this thing ... it could be bad."</p>
<p>Adam didn't push her.</p>
<p>"Type 1 diabetes."</p>
<p>"Oh," said Adam. "I didn't know."</p>
<p>She shrugged. "How would you know? I manage it. Mostly."</p>
<p>"Is there anything I need to know? Anything I might have to deal with it?"</p>
<p>Adam knew that wasn't true. But he didn't push on it. Finally, he said. "Well ... maybe it's best if, at least for a while, I run any errands we need. You know, grocery shopping, drug stores, all that."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Well, you're high risk. I'm not. So ..."</p>
<p>"If you bring it home, I'll catch it anyway."</p>
<p>"Well maybe not. If we keep our distance. And if we can cut the odds just a bit ..."</p>
<p>Anika smiled with a genuineness that made Adam melt a bit.</p>
<p>"Well ... I guess it would be nice."</p>
<p>Their arrangement worked well for a few more days. But one night, Anika was tossing and turning in bed, unable to get within screaming distance of sleep. Every time she would start to nod off, she would hear a siren in the distance; someone else headed to the hospital. It felt like the world was ending. She had never felt so alone in her life. Her family and friends were thousands of miles away. All her friends had gone home. And the only person to talk to was the jackass on the couch.</p>
<p>"That's mean," she said to herself. "He's not a jackass. He's nothing to write home about but he's not a jackass. We just got off on the wrong foot."</p>
<p>She actually giggled slightly, thinking about that moment. It was so ridiculous. The look on his face had been one for the ages. There was shock and amazement, yes. But he was such a male that, even in that moment, he couldn't help but notice her body. It was almost cute the way he looked at her, in a puppyish kind of way. For the first time in the week and a half since that day, she relaxed ever so slightly.</p>
<p>She sat up in bed, a thought forming. She looked around the empty bedroom again. As she did, another siren wailed in the distance, sending a shudder down her back.</p>
<p>She got out of bed and quickly pulled on some shorts. Then she unlocked the door and stepped through the short hallway into the living room. She could see Adam passed out on the couch. She hesitated just a moment and then spoke.</p>
<p>"Adam?"</p>
<p>Nothing. She bit her lip.</p>
<p>"Adam?!"</p>
<p>He started and looked up at her.</p>
<p>"Look, this is ... this is stupid. Why don't you ... why don't you come into the bedroom and sleep in your sister's bed?"</p>
<p>Adam shook his head to clear the cobwebs, not quite believing what he'd just heard. He sat up, blearily. He couldn't help but notice how pretty she looked in the dim light from the street lamps. The light caught her face just right and the t-shirt, as baggy as it was, couldn't hide her generous bust.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"You heard me."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>She nodded. "Yeah. You're going to destroy your back sleeping on that thing. And ... I think I can trust you."</p>
<p>A little thrill went through Adam at the sound of those words. He stood up and stretched. And this time, it was Anika's turn to take notice. He was never going to be anyone's idea of physical specimen, but he wasn't hideous. The darkness made him look a little less dorky. And as he stood up, the boxer shorts emphasized the substantial presence between his legs. For a moment, she remembered that moment when they'd met. She hadn't noticed at the time; she'd been in a state of shock. But replaying it at a distance, she realized he was quite gifted down there.</p>
<p>"Well that's as maybe," she said to herself. "It's not getting anywhere near me."</p>
<p>But she did enjoy the view. Just a bit.</p>
<p>Anika felt a bit like she was dragging him back to her cave as she led him into the bedroom. But he flopped down on the other twin bed without a word. Anika rolled her eyes and then climbed back into hers.</p>
<p>"It's crazy, isn't it?" he said.</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>
<p>"It'll be fine, though. You'll see."</p>
<p>He rolled over and, within minutes, was asleep. Anika now felt less lonely and nervous, having someone in the room with her. She looked at him one last time and then fell asleep herself.</p>
<p>That seemed to break the tension. Within the next few days, they were comfortably in a routine. They barely spoke during the day but would sit down to dinner together or watch TV while eating. They had very different tastes in TV, but both were patient when the other had the remote.</p>
<p>They began alternating nights cooking. It took Adam a little while to get used to her dietary needs but he was not a bad cook. Not as good as Anika, but not bad. And at least he tried, which was more than Anika could say for Max back home.</p>
<p>The best time was at night, however. They would lie back in their beds and talk. Or even just listen to each other's breathing. With so much happening in the world, it was good to just not be alone. And it was good to have someone who would go out into the world for her.</p>
<p>Anika was beginning to think she'd misjudged him based on that first impression. He was OK. Not great, but she could stand having him around until things got back to normal. He had a brain in his head and was a gentleman to her. And he would listen when she talked ... really, listen, which was something she desperately needed now.</p>
<p>She even stopped minding the way Adam looked at her. She'd always been self-conscious about the attentions of men, rarely dressing to emphasize her figure and almost never wearing makeup. But he wasn't creepy about it. He never made a suggestive remark or touched her unnecessarily. She wasn't even sure he was conscious of the way his eyes would linger over the curve from her waist to her hip or fixate on her eyes or hair. There was almost an innocence in the way he just ... liked looking at her. And knowing she was safe with him made his attention flattering rather than threatening. She wondered if he fantasized about her and found herself almost hoping that he did.</p>
<p>For his part, Adam was happy but with a bit of bittersweetness. Having Anika as a roommate was great. But he also could feel himself starting to fall for her. It was getting more and more difficult to ignore how attractive he found her -- intellectually, emotionally and physically. She wasn't just a pretty face; she was smart and kind. She was willing to have conversations about his interests -- action movies and science fiction -- as long as he had conversations about hers -- science and celebrity gossip. And he was slowly beginning to feel more at ease with her than he ever had with a woman.</p>
<p>He knew he had no chance with her and that bothered him. The boyfriend -- Max -- was obviously a factor. They talked on the phone or on Zoom almost every night and he had developed a distaste for him (although he did like hearing Anika's voice chattering in Dutch, even if he didn't understand a word). But even sans Max, he could tell she didn't think about him that way and never would. And he was determined not to even try to go beyond their friendship lest he ruin it. Being friends and roommates was better than nothing after all. Talking to her, making her laugh, even just sitting on the couch with her while she rolled her eyes at his taste in movies. This was already one of the better relationships he'd had.</p>
<p>But still. The way her hair moved when she shook her head. The way her smile began in her eyes. The way her clothes tried and failed to conceal her shapely figure. He couldn't deny where his heart was going.</p>
<p>Months passed before the city began to re-open. Adam dreaded that this would mean he would have to find his own place. He managed to look at a few but they would stretch his budget. And Anika, who went with him on the tours, seemed to find fault with each one.</p>
<p>After a week of searching, she came into his office, looking rather nervous.</p>
<p>"Look," she said. "I don't want you to waste your time on this. Your parents are still paying half of the rent for this place for Rachel. Why don't you just ... stay here? It's working out OK, yes?"</p>
<p>Adam felt a weight left off him and he agreed enthusiastically. Anika also felt better as she went back to her computer. The idea of spending the long nights alone had been bothering her. Later that afternoon, she got a text from Rachel.</p>
<p>Oh, he's staying there? Is something going on I should know about. :)</p>
<p>Not at all. Just hard to find a suitable place.</p>
<p>OK. Just let me know when I should I pick out my bridesmaid's dress.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Anika snorted. This had nothing to do with liking Adam. She just didn't like the idea of being alone.</p>
<p>They began to go on walks. Not long; Anika was still a bit nervous about the virus. But enough to get some exercise and fresh air. Anika enjoyed the company, feeling less lonely with every step they took together. And Adam thought she looked adorable in a mask. It emphasized her bright blue eyes and the way her long reddish-blonde hair blew across her face in the wind. And when she smiled, he could see it in those eyes.</p>
<p>It was a blazing hot late afternoon when the door to the apartment flew open and Anika came in almost in tears. She stomped into the bathroom and slammed the door.</p>
<p>Adam's first instinct was not to say anything until she came out. But hearing her frustrated grunting inside made him go up and rap gently on the door.</p>
<p>"Anika, is everything OK?</p>
<p>"No. But it's nothing major. I can deal with it."</p>
<p>"OK. Just let me know if you need anything."</p>
<p>"Ugh. Maybe a scissors."</p>
<p>The door opened again and she leaned toward him.</p>
<p>"I was walking back, just a block away, when something fell into my hair. And I can't get it out."</p>
<p>Adam looked at where she was pointing. There was a dark drop.</p>
<p>"It looks like ... tar. Maybe it dripped off a roof?"</p>
<p>"Whatever it is, I'm not getting it out."</p>
<p>She put a comb in her hair and tugged uselessly against the splotch. Then she threw the comb down in frustration.</p>
<p>"It's just a little tar."</p>
<p>"I know. It's just ... it's been a rough day. And this was just the icing on the cake."</p>
<p>"Here, let me help," said Adam.</p>
<p>"I've got two younger sisters. I'm an expert at getting stuff out of hair."</p>
<p>She looked at him.</p>
<p>"I mean, granted it was sometimes stuff I put there, but ..."</p>
<p>Anika laughed and handed him the comb. She walked into the living room and sat on the table. Adam sat behind her and began slowly picking at the knot in her hair while cleaning out the hair with a wet cloth. He eventually used a tiny bit of oil from the kitchen and that did the trick. But the hair around it was hopelessly tangled. He went to the bathroom and got a brush and began working over the tangles. Anika began to relax as he made long slow strokes through her abundant hair. Her shoulders eased a bit and she realized they'd been tense ever since the quarantine started.</p>
<p>"You have really great hair," said Adam. "You mind if I brush it out a bit?"</p>
<p>"Not at all," purred Anika.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes as he continued, enjoying each drag of the brush through her tresses. She hadn't had her hair done in over a year. She hadn't had anyone pay attention to her like this in even longer. And after a tough day, this kind of attention was exactly what she needed. Her breath began to deepen. Every muscle in her body relaxed.</p>
<p>Adam hadn't been lying; he had always been the best in the family in dealing with his sisters' hair. But as he brushed Anika's straight red-gold hair, a feeling of happiness enveloped him. Just being this close to her was intoxicating. She smelled wonderful and her skin and hair were soft to the touch. And feeling her body relax and her breath deepen made him want to never stop.</p>
<p>Anika began to feel a small tingle at the base of her spine. And as Adam continued his work, brushing and smoothing her hair like a trained beautician, she became aware of how close he was, how strong his hands felt when he occasionally touched her shoulder or back, how deep his voice was when he spoke, how his breath stirred the delicate strands of her hair on her neck.</p>
<p>It had been far too long since she'd been this close to a man. And for the first time in months, she felt the absence from her life. The tingle in her back began to spread.</p>
<p>They sat there, in increasingly loud silence, as Adam continued to brush her hair, which was now shone like a mix of platinum and copper. It was the most beautiful hair color he'd ever seen. He found himself wanting to kiss her. He resisted the temptation; he knew she wanted nothing of the kind. But she looked so beautiful. And the air between them was heavy.</p>
<p>Anika let the tingles spread throughout her body. She had the crazy notion that Adam was going to kiss her. And for a moment, she wanted him to. Her lips parted slightly, needing to be kissed. But the kiss never came. And the tingles slowly faded away, leaving her feeling like she was glowing.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Adam," she said, opening her eyes. "It's been a long time since anyone did something like that for me."</p>
<p>Adam nodded. He tried to smoothly get up and return the brush to the bathroom. But he was so intoxicated by her, he stumbled over the couch on the way. It was worth it; it provoked the most genuine laughter he'd yet heard from his roommate, a long unreserved gale.</p>
<p>Anika went to the mirror to check out Adam's work. She had not seen her hair look this good in a long time and it made her happier than she had been since quarantine began. She was tempted to run over and give Adam a little kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p>That night, Anika dreamed about sex for the first time in months. The images were vague and indistinct. But she woke feeling aroused. And felt a little twinge as she gazed over at Adam's sleeping form.</p>
<p>A few days later, Anika was in the bedroom and Adam was in the shower when she suddenly heard the water stop. He came out, dripping wet, with only a towel around his waist.</p>
<p>"Is there a problem?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I'm out of soap," he said sheepishly. "I don't suppose ... you have any I could use?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>She scrambled over the bed and bent over to get at the bottom drawer of her dresser. As she did, she realized that the top she was wearing was low cut and Adam could almost certainly see down her shirt and glimpse her deep cleavage. With a little inward smile, she took her time, letting him enjoy the view a bit. It had been a bit too long since she'd flirted with anyone.</p>
<p>After a minute, she came up with a box. And now it was her turn to get a little eye candy. The front of Adam's towel was dented a bit southward of his crotch. Quite a bit southward.</p>
<p>"He is quite well-equipped," she said to herself. He quickly grabbed the bar and headed back into the shower.</p>
<p>Anika lay back in the bed. She was feeling disoriented, her mind empty. Her thoughts were spinning around in little circles. It took her a minute to figure out what was going on: for the first time since the quarantine began, she was turned on.</p>
<p>Anika had gone for long periods without sex from time to time, being in a long-distance relationship. But this was the longest she had gone without intimacy since her first time. The unexpected celibacy had been eating at her, but she'd subconsciously buried that feeling for months. She wasn't sure what suddenly uncorked them. It wasn't the first time she'd seen Adam in a towel (or less) or been reminded that he was endowed. But within moments, her body was suffused with months of built-up sexual tension pouring through it at once. As if she'd gone into heat.</p>
<p>As Adam showered, Anika lay back on the bed. Her hard nipples strained against the tight bra. She put her hands into her pants and touched her pussy. A shudder went through her as her fingers touched her wet lips.</p>
<p>"It has been way too long," she said to herself. "Way way way too long."</p>
<p>Anika had never been big on masturbation. Even when she was thousands of miles away from her partner, it was maybe a once-a-month thing. But as the moment dragged on and her long-neglected needs burned hotter and hotter, she began to stroke her hard clit. Her other hand came up and found one of her heavy breasts and began to knead. Slowly, the dam gave way. All the sexual needs the she had been ignoring for the last few months came rushing over her in a hot wave. And she was surprised to find herself thinking not about Max but about Adam. And especially about the hefty thing she'd glimpsed dangling between his legs.</p>
<p>"If you're looking at Adam that way," she said to herself with a laugh, "It's definitely been way too long."</p>
<p>Her fingers quickened their pace. "But maybe I should just get it out of my system."</p>
<p>As her hands moved over her body, she found herself wondering if Adam was doing the same in the shower. She knew men needed to get off on a regular basis and the shower was practically the only place Adam could get any privacy. She imagined him stroking that big thing. Maybe even while thinking of her. And her hands moved faster.</p>
<p>She'd never fixated on size. In fact, she had always found the idea of a big cock a bit off-putting. A friend back home had slept with a well-endowed man and described it as awful. But after such a long celibacy, the idea of taking a massive one was growing on her.</p>
<p>The dam was now broken. Months-buried sexual thoughts surged through her mind as if trying to satisfy her entire built-up libido in just a few moments. Her body flushed with heat. Her vagina felt empty and needy, like there was an itch deep inside that only a big cock could scratch. She didn't just need to have sex; she needed to be fucked. She needed to be taken, overwhelmed, pounded to exhaustion. She needed her hips to tremble as she came hard. And knowing there was a man just a few feet away who could give her what she needed drove her to greater and greater heights of arousal.</p>
<p>In the shower, Adam was indeed masturbating. The sight of Anika's cleavage would have burned into the consciousness of any man. But because of the way he felt about her, it was almost painfully erotic. He imagined what it would have been like if she had simply undone the towel and taken his hardening cock into her mouth. His size always made fellatio tricky, but she would be too horny to let that stand in her way. He knew he wouldn't have lasted long with such a big buildup and such an attractive partner. He imagined her eyes going wide as he gave in, unable to hold out, and flooded her mouth with days worth of cum.</p>
<p>Anika began to imagine ways to seduce him as her climax began to build. She could let him come home to find her asleep and nude in his bed. Or walk into his "office" and sit astride his lap. But then she fixated on simply going over to him during the night and taking him. He would be hard already, dreaming about her. And when she mounted his big pole, he wouldn't know if he was awake or dreaming. She moaned as her body got closer and closer to the edge of the falls.</p>
<p>Adam gasped as his balls filled up and prepared to unleash. He was now imagining that she had come into the shower and climbed in with him. He began to peak as he envisioned her up again the wall, her big breasts pressed against him, his hands tight on her full hips, pressing her generous ass against the tiles. She would take every inch of him like she was made for it.</p>
<p>In the bedroom, Anika imagined the look Adam would have on his face when she mounted him, sliding her smoldering pussy down his monstrous shaft. She was right on the brink but couldn't quite go over. And then her imagination shifted to lying back in bed, her legs wide as he pounded her over and over again, ignoring her pleas to stop because it was too much, forcing her to cum over and over again on his enormous penis. She bit down a cry as she came. She kept going as it dragged out longer and more intense than she was used to, making her toes curl.</p>
<p>In the shower, Adam spurted against the shower wall as he imagined himself flooding Anika's tight little cunt over and over. Rope after rope of semen spattered uselessly on the tiles as he started breathing again.</p>
<p>Anika lay back in bed as she enjoyed the afterglow. It had been a long time since she'd cum and she'd almost forgotten how happy it made her.</p>
<p>"I simply must do this more often," she said with a slight giggle.</p>
<p>She heard the shower stop and a wave of self-consciousness replaced the wave of happiness. She straightened herself and then rolled over in bed. By the time Adam came in, fully clothed, she had her nose in a book and was ignoring him. After all, she didn't really want him. It had just been the frustration talking.</p>
<p>The next few weeks dragged by. On the surface, everything was fine. They worked. They talked. They had dinner. They watched TV. They went for walks. She began to teach Adam a little bit of Dutch. But beneath that, both of them were on edge. Because each of their minds was filled with barely-controlled sexual thoughts the other.</p>
<p>Adam had only been with four women in his life. One had refused sex once she saw how big his penis was (although she would come back on occasion to blow him or just look at it). Two had been OK with it after a while but had always found him a bit much. But his last girlfriend -- who had heard about his endowment from a friend -- had loved it. He could close his eyes and see Yulia riding him or laying underneath him, cumming hard and moaning about how his massive cock was and how well he filled her. Even after they'd broken up, she had come back for the occasional ride, the last only a few weeks before quarantine. And every now and then, he would get suggestive texts from her.</p>
<p>He imagined that Anika would be like Yulia. He imagined her getting on top of him, nervous but excited. He imagined those beautiful blue eyes going wide when she felt his girth but then melting in surrender as her pussy stretched to accommodate him.</p>
<p>The sensible part of his brain tried to keep these fantasies in check. "Look at her," he said to himself. "Do you think a girl like that wants anything to do with you?" But it was hard to not think about it, seeing her every day, remembering that brief moment when he's seen her gloriously topless, getting to know and like her, savoring those brief moments when they inadvertently touched and her skin felt so soft and warm against his. As time went on, he was realizing that she wasn't just pretty. Or attractive. She was beautiful. He was completely smitten.</p>
<p>Anika wasn't quite in the same place. She knew this was just the quarantine speaking. But she was frequently aware of how he looked at her and how sexy it made her feel. She was now masturbating a few times a week -- a pace she'd never been at before. But no matter how much she tried to keep her sexual fantasies focused on other things, the idea of him constantly crept in, to the point where she couldn't really climax without thinking about him and his big cock.</p>
<p>But something gave her pause a couple of weeks later when she got the impersonal dumping of her life. It was an e-mail from Max that said he was seeing someone else. She should have been heartbroken. Or at least angry at the short shrift. But, to her surprise, what she mostly felt was a sense of relief. It had never really been a good relationship. And she was honestly glad to be free of it.</p>
<p>It had nothing to do with Adam, obviously. And if she masturbated herself to two orgasms that night thinking about him taking her from behind ... well, that was still just the quarantine talking.</p>
<p>It was about a week later when there was a blackout on the hottest day of the year. They woke up groggy and spent the entire morning trying to stay cool. Adam set up an ancient fan near the window to keep the circulation going. But it did little to relieve the oppressive heat.</p>
<p>About midday, Anika couldn't stand it any more. She went into the wardrobe to find something cooler to wear. It was so hot, she felt like wearing anything would be too much. After considering and rejecting several candidates, her eyes fixed on something at the back of the wardrobe and she grinned.</p>
<p>"Why not? It won't hurt to give him a little bit of eye candy. And it is the coolest thing I own."</p>
<p>A few minutes later, she returned to the living room. Adam glanced at her, realized what he was seeing and did a double take. She had shed her shorts and shirt and was now wearing a bright blue bikini. For the first time since their initial meeting, he could fully appreciate her curvaceous body as the tight fabric emphasized her full hips and 36D breasts, which seemed about to pop out of the top. He tried to not ogle her so obviously. He tried to look away. And he utterly failed to do so.</p>
<p>Anika sat down on the couch. For most of her life, she wasn't comfortable being looked at the way Adam was looking at her. It was one of the reasons she had only worn this suit in saunas or sparsely-inhabited beaches. And she was always self-conscious about it revealing the small insulin pump on her arm and the glucose monitor on her belly (Max always seemed put off by the sight of them). But with Adam, she found herself liking the attention. Feeling sexy because of it. Maybe even a little aroused by it. And she was not self-conscious about her devices at all. He didn't stare at them, but he didn't pretend they didn't exist either.</p>
<p>"Let him look," she thought.</p>
<p>A few minutes passed. And then Adam spoke.</p>
<p>"Do you mind if I go a little lighter too?" he asked. "I'm burning up."</p>
<p>"No, be my guest," she said.</p>
<p>He stood up and slowly stripped off his shirt and shorts, leaving him in nothing but his boxers. They were a little small on him -- or at least not designed for men of his endowment -- and thus emphasized the outsized bulge in front. Now it was Anika's turn to gaze. As much as she'd appreciated that she was sharing an apartment with a well-hung man, she hadn't appreciated just quite how endowed he was. She could vaguely make out the shape of his large testicles and then the long tube of flesh going down the boxers. She was actually disappointed when he sat back down.</p>
<p>Anika lay on the couch, on her side in a way that emphasized the spectacular curve from her hips to her waist. Adam laid back on the floor, his endowment well visible. There was nothing to do without power and neither wanted to drain their phone. The heat sapped any will to talk or read. And so they lay there quietly, half-dozing in the oppressive heat. Each was lost in their own thoughts, which were turning increasingly toward each other.</p>
<p>Anika kept thinking about when Adam has brushed her hair and the kiss she had anticipated but that had never come. She began to imagine what might have happened if he had kissed her. Anika loved being kissed and loved the way she would completely melt under the weight of a good one. She imagined Adam giving her a kiss that made her toes curl. How she would have fallen into his arms. How he would have laid her back on the couch, slowly eroding her sensibilities with each touch of their lips.</p>
<p>Adam was thinking of the same moment. His heart felt heavy as he imagined her blue eyes closing in passion as she got more and more into the moment. He imagined her climbing up on the table and leaning into him. He imagined pulling her closer and feeling her big breasts pressing into his chest. He realized that these thoughts were starting to make him hard and wondered how he could roll over without making it obvious.</p>
<p>Anika glanced down and was amazed to see that Adam's well-defined cock seemed to be getting bigger, firming up in his boxers and thickening. The sight prompted truly wicked thoughts in her head. She imagined going over and straddling him, pressing her mons against his big penis. His eyes would open wide in surprise. But it wouldn't take long before he was groping her, squeezing her, kissing her, devouring her body with his mouth and hands. She would ease his massive erection out and began rubbing it against her bikini as her passion took over.</p>
<p>Her nipples hardened painfully against the material of the bikini. Her pussy was wet with desire. She began to gently squeeze her thighs together. It was intensely pleasurable; but all it did was deepen her need. After a while, she could feel an orgasm was out there; but she wasn't going to get there without something more direct.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>She glanced over at Adam again. For a second, she was actually going to do it. She was going to walk over and just let it happen. Grind against his big cock until she came. But then the sensible part of her brain stopped her.</p>
<p>"It's just the heat. Don't ruin everything because you're letting it get to you."</p>
<p>Anika suddenly stood up. Adam glanced over, drinking in her form. She looked hot and bothered, almost radiant.</p>
<p>"I think I'm going to just hop in the shower," said Anika hurriedly. "Just to cool off for a second."</p>
<p>"OK," he mumbled, watching her ass as she hurried off.</p>
<p>The cold spray of water did little to snap Anika out of it. If anything, it seemed to make her desire even more focused and intense. She turned the water a little warmer and let it run down her body.</p>
<p>"I don't need a cold shower," she giggled. "I need to be fucked."</p>
<p>She began to mechanically rinse her body. But touching her own skin just heightened her arousal. She began to squeeze her breasts as her hand wandered down to her pussy again. Just a quick cum, she thought, and it'll all be out of my head.</p>
<p>In the living room, Adam breathed a sigh of relief. Anika had left right as he got fully massively erect. And with the images buzzing through his mind, he knew it would be a long time before his hard-on went away. He peeled down his shorts and began quickly stroking his cock. Just a quick cum, he thought, and I can last the rest of the day.</p>
<p>It didn't take Anika long. She was already highly aroused from her fantasies before. She leaned heavily against the wall as the orgasm that had been building all afternoon finally hit her. For a moment, she wished Adam could see her doing this, look into her face while she came.</p>
<p>But the climax didn't sate her need, it only stimulated it even more. She began to stroke her clit even harder, her head now filled with images of Adam barging into the bathroom and just taking her against the wall, working that massive cock of his deep into her, his eyes lighting up as she took every last inch. He would aggressively plow her through orgasm after orgasm, not even slowing down as she came all over his big cock. Then she imagined his strokes getting more and more erratic as he approached his own climax.</p>
<p>Anika wasn't on the pill; it created problems for her. But she liked being cummed in. She had to be very careful because her cycles were irregular. But the feel of a man thrusting against her, putting his seed into her, following his instinct to impregnate her, satisfied something deep in her psyche.</p>
<p>She began to imagine Adam cumming inside her. She knew he'd cum massively and very deep. She imagined that animal look filling his eyes as he seeded her, trying to put his baby in her tender belly. And her second orgasm began to build.</p>
<p>Adam knew he shouldn't be doing this but he needed to get off or he'd be hard for the rest of the day. He kept one ear on the sound of the shower and the water splashing off of Anika's curvaceous body, ready to stop the second the sound stopped. But a part of him hoped she would catch him anyway. He imagined her walking over, her voluptuous body still draped in a towel, examining his big cock like it was a specimen in her lab before beginning to stroke up and down its nine-inch length, her hand unable to completely encircle his considerable girth.</p>
<p>The towel would fall to the floor, revealing her glorious frame. She would straddle him, rubbing her warm pussy against him. She wouldn't initially intend to have sex. But the feel of his cock against her, the hotness of the moment, the way the kissing and groping eroded her sensibilities, would get her rolling her hips, maneuvering his gorged head until it was between her wet vulva and then slowly but surely taking him. He stretched out his legs and bumped against the table.</p>
<p>Anika heard the noise of the table moving. For a moment, she wondered if Adam had finally had enough and was about to come into the bathroom and take her at long last. The door failed to open. But she wondered what she would have done if the curtain really had flown open to reveal Adam standing there, his cock massively erect. And that pushed her over again. Anika gripped the handrail tightly as a second even more powerful climax went through her. She rarely climaxed more than once -- from sex, from masturbating or from anything. It was more common for her not to cum at all. But her body was on fire today.</p>
<p>In the bedroom, Adam imagined Anika sliding her wet pussy down his cock, taking his girth easily and delightedly. He groaned as his balls filled with cum. But just as he was about to go off, he heard the shower stop.</p>
<p>Adam panicked. He pulled his boxers up but his erection tented them to an almost comical degree. He hurried into the bedroom and lay face-down on the bed, trying to look casual.</p>
<p>Anika came back in, now wearing the bikini again. And the second she saw Adam lying on the bed, she knew her effort to relieve the pressure hadn't worked. She was still turned on.</p>
<p>She flopped down in the other bed. Regardless of her continued arousal, she was happy that Adam was in the bedroom with her. She just felt safer and more relaxed with him around. And in the warm heat of the afternoon and the warm pleasure of each other's presence, they both began to doze.</p>
<p>Anika began to dream. At first, it was only fragments. A hazy kiss in the darkness. A firm hand on her breast. But as she drifted deeper, she dreamed that she was tied up on the couch. It took her a moment to realize that the apartment had been robbed and she'd been trussed up and left on her own. She wasn't uncomfortable but she struggled and strained against the ropes to no avail.</p>
<p>She suddenly realized that Adam had come home. He came over to her, a look of concern on his face, and gently checked her to make sure she was all right. But before she could utter a word of explanation, he kissed her.</p>
<p>Anika melted under the kiss. She began kissing him back, her heart pounding as she realized how deeply she'd wanted this. Adam's hands began to rove all over her body, lingering especially over her waist and her face. She still couldn't move but she writhed under his caresses. Adam pulled down the cups of her bra and began lavishing kisses on her breasts, sending her excitement soaring into the stratosphere. There was nothing she could do to stop him. And she didn't want to. He was going to have his way with her and she was going to love every minute of it.</p>
<p>He began kissing his way down her body, lingering a long time over her breasts and tummy. She began to breathe deeply, anticipating what he was about to do. Anika had always been somewhat indifferent to oral. She loved the idea but had always been somewhat disappointed with the execution. But she felt this was going to be different. She theatrically strained at the ropes and faux-begged him to untie her. But he ignored her pleas as he closed in on her pussy, which was now soaked in anticipation.</p>
<p>Adam was also dreaming. In his dream, they were watching TV. Only instead of sitting in their usual spots on opposite ends of the couch, Anika was lying down, her auburn head nestled in his lap, her hand idly stroking his knee. As they watched, her hand began to move up his leg, slowly climbing up and up until it touched the head of his hardening cock.</p>
<p>Anika rolled over to face him, a catlike grin on her face. She was now openly stroking his cock through his pants. She rolled a bit more and kissed the swollen head through the fabric.</p>
<p>"You're so big," she said. "I don't know if it will fit inside me."</p>
<p>"I'll make it fit," he replied.</p>
<p>She maneuvered around until she was straddling him, her short skirt riding up over her big hips. She began to kiss him and rub her panty-covered cunt against him. He reached up and took hold of her big tits. She moaned into his mouth at the sensation.</p>
<p>"I've wanted this for so long," she said.</p>
<p>In Anika's dream, her body was on fire as Adam mercilessly and expertly ate her out. She was still tied up so could only lie there helplessly while he worked her over, driving her excitement to higher and higher levels.</p>
<p>She began to alternate cooing encouragement at him and demanding to be cut loose. And he was picking up her every cue, doing the things that made her moan while taunting her when she struggled. Her body felt so hot she thought she might burn through the ropes. And she kept getting closer and closer. He was teasing her, pushing her right to the edge of climax but not quite over.</p>
<p>In Adam's dream, Anika had mounted him. To his delight, she took his big cock easily, her full hips sliding down until he was completely inside her. She began riding him eagerly, moaning with each deep stroke. He knew he wasn't going to last long. He tried holding back. But she was too hot and too horny. Her relentless posting -- up and down, backward and forward -- was pushing him toward eruption. His balls felt heavy with cum.</p>
<p>"Anika, I'm not going to last long."</p>
<p>"It's OK. Cum inside me. I want you to cum inside me."</p>
<p>But just as he was about to erupt and fill Anika with his cum, he began to wake up. He felt a crushing disappointment descend on him, partially because the sex had been imaginary but mostly because he'd been so happy thinking Anika wanted him. He tried to push himself back into sleep, to continue the dream in his imagination. But all it did was wake him up faster.</p>
<p>He glanced briefly over his back at Anika's sleeping form, desperately wanting to go over and wake her up with a kiss. But he knew she didn't want it; even thinking about taking advantage of her that way felt like a betrayal. So he rolled over, still half-asleep, his cock now painfully erect and right on the verge of erupting.</p>
<p>Just as Anika was about to cum, she also woke. She almost cried out in frustration. She was soaked in sweat from the hot day but also on fire with need. Her pussy was wet and needy. Her ovaries ached. She glanced over at Adam, who was still asleep, facing away from her, and then slowly moved her hand down to her wet pussy.</p>
<p>As she lay back in the bed, she imagined looking up and seeing him standing there. He would just watch as she pleasured herself. And once she really got going, he would get between her legs, push aside the thin strip over her pussy and go down on her until she couldn't take anymore. Just like in her dream.</p>
<p>Anika found herself desperately wishing her fantasy would become reality. Had Adam come over to her bed at the moment, she would have welcomed him, embraced him, let him have his way with her. Anything to relieve the desperate need between her legs.</p>
<p>Anika fought to stay still as she came for the third time that afternoon, this one even more intense. She wanted to cry out. She wanted to thrash on the bed. But she forced herself to stay still, barely holding on as waves of pleasure rolled through her body, her mind afire with images of Adam taking her.</p>
<p>Adam's hand had moved down to is swollen cock and stroked it a few times. But just that was enough to suddenly kick him over. He didn't dare properly stroke himself, lest Anika see what he was doing. So he just had to lie there, holding his breath as his cock jerked mightily, sending spurt after spurt into his boxers until the front was soaked with white semen. All he could think about in that moment was Anika cooing as he filled her up. Just being around Anika seemed to make him cum harder and more voluminously. He couldn't imagine how much he'd cum if he were actually with her.</p>
<p>As they lay there, each in a secret afterglow, there was a loud bang and the power came back on with a cold blast of air-conditioning. Anika quickly hopped up and went into the bathroom to change. Adam used it as an opportunity to clean himself up and close the windows. Within an hour, the apartment was reasonable again and they were back to their normal routine, pretending that none of it had happened.</p>
<p>"It's just a fantasy," Adam said to himself. "She doesn't want any of that."</p>
<p>"It was just the heat," Anika told herself. "Just the heat getting to me."</p>
<p>Anika found it strange the way she was compartmentalizing everything. Most of the time, Adam was just a presence in her life: an unseen companion during working hours, a good friend during the evening, a quiet stolid presence at night. But there were these sudden flashes where she was very turned on by him, sometimes wanting him to kiss her, sometimes wanting him to ravish her without mercy.</p>
<p>"You don't really want him," she kept telling herself. "It's just been too long. The minute you start meeting other people, you'll realize that."</p>
<p>Adam was in a similar place. He deeply enjoyed just hanging out with Anika, not even thinking about anything sexual. But she was increasingly intoxicating. Even the most innocent things would get him turned on. A quiet moment could suddenly be filled with intense fantasies.</p>
<p>"Don't ruin it," he kept telling himself. "You've got a good thing going."</p>
<p>One afternoon, he noticed she'd been unusually quiet. She had a habit of talking to herself while working, usually in Dutch, and it was one of the many things he found endearing about her. But she'd been oddly quiet all day. He went to check on her and found her curled up on the couch defensively. The way she was laying told him that something was wrong.</p>
<p>"Anika, are you OK?" he asked.</p>
<p>She didn't answer at first.</p>
<p>"Anika?"</p>
<p>"I'm fine," she said in a tone of voice that said she was anything but fine. Adam went over and sat on the table in front of the couch.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>He put his hand gently on her shoulder. Anika rolled onto her back and he could see that she'd been crying. She slowly sat up, facing him.</p>
<p>"It's OK. I just get like this sometimes. All the stress of finishing my dissertation and ... " she waved her hands at the world outside the windows.</p>
<p>"You want to talk about it."</p>
<p>She wiped her face.</p>
<p>"It's OK. I know you're busy."</p>
<p>"I'm never too busy for you," he said.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she was in Adam's arms. There was nothing sexual about it. She just needed to be held. And so he just held her, letting her breathe, occasionally rubbing her back.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, Anika sat back and started talking. And once the words came, it was a flood. She talked about being dumped by Max and how she felt bad that she didn't care about it. She talked about missing her family. She talked about the stress of finishing her dissertation. He made occasional comments ("Your ex is a fool. You'll see your family soon enough.") But mostly, he just listened, which was what she needed.</p>
<p>She finally got around to what had touched off this particular bout of bad feeling. One of the faulty members was making things difficult for her, questioning everything she did and subtly dissing her work in meetings. She'd given a short Zoom seminar that morning and he'd been all over her with "questions" that were mostly snide comments. Adam listened for a while and then spoke.</p>
<p>"Let me ask you something. Does he have any power over you? Is he on your committee or writing letters or anything?"</p>
<p>"No. He's just an old fart. He's the kind of man who is bad to everyone but especially bad to women."</p>
<p>Adam paused. "Well, then fuck him. Who cares what he thinks?"</p>
<p>Anika gaped in astonishment.</p>
<p>"Next time, just say, 'I don't have time for your bullshit', mute him and let him rant at the screen."</p>
<p>Anika burst out laughing. And she laughed for a good minute, a sound which was music to Adam's ears.</p>
<p>"Thank you. Seriously, Adam. You have no idea how much I needed that perspective. 'Fuck him'. Yes."</p>
<p>She went to the kitchen and washed her face.</p>
<p>"Feeling better."</p>
<p>"A bit. I get like this sometimes. Just comes with being me. It takes a while to get right again. But it helps not being alone."</p>
<p>Adam saluted.</p>
<p>"Glad to be of service, my lady."</p>
<p>She went up and give him a little peck on the forehead before going back to work. Adam went back to his office but failed to get anything done due to the flip-flopping of his heart and the inability of his brain to form a coherent thought for some time. He felt like a little kid, not wanting to ever wash his forehead where he could still feel that little kiss.</p>
<p>A week later, Anika had to go into the lab for the first time in months. She told Adam it would probably take her all day and noted the slight disappointment in his eyes. But he was far from her thoughts once she got to work. She had missed being in the lab; reagents were definitely her jam. And the work went better than expected, allowing her to finish early.</p>
<p>So she was feeling pretty good as she headed home. Walking around still made her a bit nervous, mask or no mask. But she was looking forward to getting back home as well. She had to admit that having Adam around wasn't just better than having no one around, it was better than having almost anyone around. The way he looked at her. The way he looked after her. His patience with her girly movies or reality shows.</p>
<p>She stopped at a liquor store. She never drank but knew that Adam did before moving in with her. She found a little bottle of expensive whiskey; Rachel had told her what he liked. He deserved a little thank-you for everything.</p>
<p>When she opened the door to her apartment, she was pleased to hear his familiar voice. But then she hesitated. The voice answering him was an unfamiliar female one.</p>
<p>She closed the door quietly and slowly edged around the corner of the wall. He was in his office in the dining room so she edged a little closer and peeked into a tiny space between the wall and the sheet they had drawn across the entrance.</p>
<p>Adam was facing away from her. But she could see his computer screen. On it was a small pretty blond girl. She was definitely not one of his co-workers.</p>
<p>Anika was surprised to feel a little upset. Not only that he had some girl he was seeing but that he had kept it a secret from her. She was about to move away when she caught the girl's name -- Yulia. It was his ex. He'd mentioned that they'd parted on good terms. She could now see he hadn't been lying. She felt a flood of relief.</p>
<p>She went back to the little gap in the sheet. For the most part, it was just standard chatter. His job, her quest for a job, the lack of a social life. She was going to walk away again when she heard her own name.</p>
<p>"So ... how is Anika doing?"</p>
<p>"Well, I think. It's still hard on her, being so far away from her family. And her boyfriend dumped her."</p>
<p>"Oh?" said Yulia with a sly grin.</p>
<p>"I told you ... there's no chance at that."</p>
<p>"I can hope."</p>
<p>"I can't."</p>
<p>Anika frowned at the resignation in those words. She didn't like hearing him be down on himself. The problem wasn't that he wasn't good enough for her. The problem was ... well, she didn't know what the problem was, but that definitely wasn't it. It was just that she knew that her carnal thoughts were just the quarantine talking.</p>
<p>"She sounds great."</p>
<p>"She is. Which is why I don't want to wreck things."</p>
<p>"Well, she doesn't know what she's missing out on."</p>
<p>"I'm sure she does."</p>
<p>There was a pause and then Yulia leaned in toward the camera.</p>
<p>"I sometimes miss it."</p>
<p>A note crept into Adam's voice that Anika had never heard before. A sly sort of confidence. It drew her attention back.</p>
<p>"You, I could take or leave. It, though ..."</p>
<p>"Sometimes I think it was the only reason you were with me for so long."</p>
<p>"Oh, definitely," she said with a little laugh. "The rest of you ... meh."</p>
<p>For a second, Anika was offended on Adam's behalf. She was tempted to fling open the curtain and tell Yulia off. But then another little laugh let her know that Yulia was just flirting with him.</p>
<p>A pause. And then. "Is this the part where you're going to ask to see it?"</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>A little shudder went through Anika. She moved her head to the side just to make sure she wasn't visible to them. But the darkness of the living room kept her invisible.</p>
<p>"Maaaaybe. It has been a while. Maybe it's not quite as big as I remember."</p>
<p>"Only one way to find out."</p>
<p>Yulia grinned. "Well."</p>
<p>"Well, what?"</p>
<p>"Do you think I could take a look?"</p>
<p>"A look at what?"</p>
<p>"That ... thing. Your thing."</p>
<p>"I have lots of things."</p>
<p>"The one in your pants."</p>
<p>"My wallet?"</p>
<p>"Something just to the side of it."</p>
<p>"Still not sure what you're on about."</p>
<p>Yulia looked around, leaned in and mouthed, "Your cock."</p>
<p>"Why would you want to see that?"</p>
<p>"Because every girl likes the sight of a big fat cock."</p>
<p>"Not really."</p>
<p>"Well I do."</p>
<p>"What will you do if you see it?"</p>
<p>"Well, I'm wearing a short skirt right now. Use your imagination."</p>
<p>Anika heard the chair scrape against the carpet as Adam stood up. He pulled down is pants. From her angle, Anika couldn't see it. But she hard Yulia giggle nervously.</p>
<p>"He doesn't need her," Anika thought. "She's far too skinny. He needs a real woman who can take what he has to give."</p>
<p>She flushed at the unexpected thought. The quarantine was really affecting her thinking.</p>
<p>"My memory never does it justice," Anika said with a little quaver in her voice. "I can't believe I let you put that thing in me."</p>
<p>"If I remember right, you were the one who climbed on board the first time," he said.</p>
<p>"It doesn't look quite full size, though. Maybe you need to play with it a bit."</p>
<p>A giant pile of emotions suddenly hit Anika all at once, with such an intensity that she almost staggered. She realized she couldn't just stay here and watch, as arousing as the sight was. She quietly exited the door.</p>
<p>Adam turned, sure he had heard the door open and close. But he didn't hear Anika's shoes on the floor or see the light go on. He turned back to the screen. But the thought of Anika was now in his mind. He suddenly felt foolish standing there with his dick in his hand, showing it off to his ex. As beautiful as Yuliya was and as hot as she as for him ... she wasn't Anika.</p>
<p>"Something wrong?" she asked.</p>
<p>He turned back. "Nothing. Just a little tired I think."</p>
<p>Anika walked a few blocks before the feelings in her head began to sort themselves out. The scene back at the apartment shouldn't have bothered her. But it did.</p>
<p>"Why?" she asked herself. "He's not your boyfriend. He's a single guy enjoying some attention from a woman. What's wrong with that?"</p>
<p>The sight of Adam and Yuliya in the early stages of Zoom sex had definitely bothered her. But she realized it had also aroused her. She wished she'd stayed to watch what had happened. Maybe even now, Adam was spurting cum all over the place. She shuddered with both disgust and arousal.</p>
<p>"It's just the quarantine talking," she said to herself. "You just haven't gotten any in so long."</p>
<p>That Adam was doing this with his ex also produced mixed feelings. On the one hand, she was happy that he was on good terms with her. On the other hand ...</p>
<p>On the other hand ...</p>
<p>Anika stopped on a street corner and looked at her reflection in the window of a closed store. She looked into her eyes.</p>
<p>"You know what this is all about, don't you? You, my girl, are jealous."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not. I'm just ... disgusted."</p>
<p>"No, you're not. You would have done Zoom sex with Max had it mattered to you. You're jealous because he was showing off to another woman. To his ex. Not you. This is the exact way you'd react if he was cheating on you."</p>
<p>"That's ridiculous. He's not my boyfriend. He's just this guy that ..."</p>
<p>"You have sexual fantasies about almost every night. That makes you feel safe and cared about and beautiful. And is sexually pleasing a woman a thousand miles away wile you sit there ten feet away doing nothing."</p>
<p>She sat down on a bench, her head spinning.</p>
<p>"It's just the quarantine. The minute he goes away-"</p>
<p>And just thinking those words made her heart ache. She didn't want him to go away. She wanted him to stay. She'd wanted him to stay for months. She didn't want to find another roommate or another boyfriend. She wanted him. Adam. Her friend. Her best friend.</p>
<p>Anna stood up and began to walk back toward the apartment. She wasn't sure what she was thinking. She wasn't sure what she was feeling. All she was sure of was that she wanted to get back to their place, curl up next to him on the couch and feel safe and loved. And then ... see what happened.</p>
<p>In the apartment, Adam was sitting in front of the computer. His Zoom sex with Yulia -- if that was what you called it -- had not been very satisfying. It was nice to be appreciated and desired. And he had taken some satisfaction in watching Yuliya bring herself to climax as he stroked his cock for her. But he hadn't cum. And the whole thing had left him feeling empty.</p>
<p>He'd been somewhat surprised to get a text from Yulia asking if he wanted to chat over Zoom. They had been in semi-regular contact since breaking up -- the odd text and occasional phone conversation. There was no way they were ever getting back together. But it was nice to talk to her occasionally. And since he knew Anika would be out that day, it had seemed like a good time.</p>
<p>Seeing her face had reminded him both of how much he liked her and how glad he was to be out of the relationship. The sex had been amazing, yes. And they were still good friends. But she wasn't interested in kids, had no interest in his interests and had little use for the stay-at-home life he preferred. She was the kind of girl who wanted to be out all night with friends and he just ... wasn't that.</p>
<p>But what was really getting to him was that, as pretty as Yuliya was and as much as she wanted him -- physically, if not emotionally -- it wasn't enough.</p>
<p>It wasn't Anika.</p>
<p>Yulia had been encouraging about Anika. He had expected her to either not care or to be jealous, but she seemed genuinely happy that he had found a friend and enthusiastic about the idea of their getting together.</p>
<p>"You're a good guy," she'd said in a text weeks ago. "And I want you to be happy."</p>
<p>"That's nice."</p>
<p>"Plus, every day you're not making a woman happy with that thing between your legs is a wasted one. ;-)"</p>
<p>This was her sense of humor, one of the things that had made their relationship good while it lasted. But it struck home just a little bit. He didn't just want to sleep with Anika; he wanted to please her. It sounded ridiculous when he thought about it: he wasn't doing a woman a favor by sleeping with her. But imagining Anika's body convulsing in orgasm or her eyes glazing with pleasure. Or just thinking about her lying in bed, sexually exhausted. It was part of how he felt about her.</p>
<p>He sighed. There was clearly no hope in that direction. But he was trapped. He should move out for his own sanity. But, at the same time, the idea of moving away made his heart break. If it was a choice between celibacy with Anika and a sex life without her ... well, maybe he'd feel differently when the quarantine was over.</p>
<p>As he was about to close up the computer, an e-mail came in from his boss. He clicked on it.</p>
<p>Anika was almost shaking with nervousness when she got back to the apartment. She still had no idea what she was going to do. No idea what she felt. No idea what was going to happen. Was the relationship they'd carefully built over the lasts seven months going to come crashing down? Was it going to change? Were things just going to continue as normal? She didn't know. And the lack of knowing scared her. She felt like something momentous was about to happen but had no idea what.</p>
<p>She laughed to herself slightly. The one person she wished she could talk to about it was Adam.</p>
<p>The apartment was strangely quiet when she opened the door. She checked his office ... nothing. She went into the bedroom and saw him lying curled up on the bed. Her heart beat faster in her chest.</p>
<p>"What do I do?" she asked herself. "What do I feel? What does he feel?" She'd thought that seeing him would make all the answers obvious. But it only made her more confused.</p>
<p>Amidst this, she suddenly noticed there was something odd about the way he was lying. It was not his usual casual sprawl. He was curled up defensively. It took a moment for her to realize: something had gone badly wrong.</p>
<p>Anika put all her confused feelings aside for a moment. She crept over and laid down next to him on the bed. She curled up against him and put her arms around him, holding him the same way he'd held her when the depression had hit. He unclenched a bit under her embrace.</p>
<p>"Adam, are you OK? Is something wrong? You can tell me."</p>
<p>"It's ... nothing."</p>
<p>"You're my friend. I won't judge you or anything. I'm here for you."</p>
<p>He got his phone, thumbed a bit and held it up. Anika looked at it for a moment before she realized what it said. His employer was letting him go.</p>
<p>"Oh, Adam .... It's OK. Don't let it get you down. You're a smart, hard-working guy. Something will come up, I know."</p>
<p>"You can't know that."</p>
<p>"I know I don't share my apartment with losers. So if you're here ..."</p>
<p>"I just ... I feel so useless right now. It's like the last seven months have been wasted."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't say that at all. You got some job experience. And I'm sure they'll write you a great recommendation. And ..."</p>
<p>She hesitated. She hadn't been expecting the words that now rolled off of her tongue.</p>
<p>"And just your being here ... has meant a lot to me. I'm glad it's been you I've had to spend these months with. I don't know that I would have gotten through them in one piece without you. There's no one else I'd rather be here with. You're the sweetest guy I've ever met."</p>
<p>He reached up and took her hand. His body relaxed against hers. It was silent for a long time.</p>
<p>"I think that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me."</p>
<p>"Well, then you need better friends because every word of it is true."</p>
<p>They didn't speak after that. They just lay there, listening to each other's breathing. And they fell asleep with Anika still holding him.</p>
<p>Adam woke first to find himself facing Anika. The sight of her asleep -- with the morning light on her face and her red-gold hair spilled all over the pillow -- made his pain over getting fired fade away. He'd never seen anyone so beautiful. No matter what had happened, life was good waking up to the sight of her. Even if nothing ever happened between then, he had this moment. He sat there just watching her for a few minutes. And then, her eyelids fluttered to reveal those deep blue eyes. And she smiled at him.</p>
<p>"Good morning," she said with a sheepish grin. "Feeling better?"</p>
<p>He nodded. Anika became keenly aware of how close their faces were and how tightly their bodies were pressed against one another in the small single bed. She bit her lip as she remembered the night before and the confused feelings that had been pouring through her. But she didn't dare speak and possibly ruin the moment.</p>
<p>"Anika ..."</p>
<p>"Adam, I ..."</p>
<p>She trailed off and looked away. Without thinking about what he was doing, Adam put a trembling hand up and gently touched her face. She closed her eyes and leaned her face into the caress, her months-long inhibitions starting to melt. His hand felt so strong against her. She began to tremble as well.</p>
<p>"You look ... so beautiful in the morning," he managed to get out, his heart pounding.</p>
<p>All of Anika's confusion from the night before went up in a puff of smoke at those words. She knew as certainly as she'd ever known anything what her feelings were. And it wasn't about sexual frustration or quarantine or anything else. A tear came out of her eye. She leaned forward.</p>
<p>Their lips touched tentatively. And then it was like dry kindling exploding into flame. Within moments, they were kissing like long-lost lovers who had not seen each other in years. Anika was almost immediately overwhelmed by the passion of it. No one had ever kissed her with this kind of intense desire, as though he wanted to devour her. It was everything she had imagined it could be.</p>
<p>"Oh, God, I've wanted this for so long," Adam managed to say between kisses.</p>
<p>"Me too," she replied, finally letting her desire into her heart.</p>
<p>Time slowed down. It felt like they lay there kissing for hours in the warm morning, occasionally whispering sweet nothings or laughing in pure relief. It was Anika who eventually took Adam's hand and pulled it up to her breasts, which were starting to ache with need.</p>
<p>Once his hand closed in on their fleshy reality, it was like something was unleashed in him. He aggressively rolled on top of Anika. Her legs parted, pulling her short skirt to her waist, allowing him to grind heavily against her. She moaned as her pussy finally began to get the attention it had so desperately needed after all these long months.</p>
<p>"Don't be gentle with me, big boy," she whispered into his ear. "I want this. I want you."</p>
<p>Anika helped him peel off her tight shirt, revealing her lacy white bra. Adam took a moment to drink in the sight of her formidable bustline and the way it perfectly filled out the bra. And the he bent down and began to kiss the tops of her big tits, slowly working his way down until he was kissing her hard nipples through the fabric while gently squeezing the more-than-handfuls.</p>
<p>Anika moaned in response. Her breasts were quite sensitive and she loved the gentle but aggressive way he was treating them. He was being aggressive enough to show how much she turned him on but not so much that he was hurting her. She arched her back, pushing a nipple into his mouth and making them look even bigger. And she cried out when he pulled down the lacy material and began to kiss and lick them in earnest. She reached back and undid the three hooks of her bra and let Adam ease it off her.</p>
<p>Adam's memory had not done her justice. Anika's breasts were not just big, they were perfectly shaped and just heavy enough to let him know they were real. Anika wriggled at his delighted unabashed admiration and then moaned when he began kissing and fondling them again. Tension began to build in her vagina and she wondered if he could make her cum just from this.</p>
<p>Adam began kissing his way down her belly and Anika tensed in anticipation of where he was going. She had imagined him going down on her so many times and giving her the kind of pleasure she'd imagined but never experienced. Now it was going to happen and she was ready for it in every possible way.</p>
<p>But he was in no rush and spent a gloriously long time exploring her body. He'd always found her soft belly to be one of her most appealing features and there was not a square inch he did not caress or kiss on his way down. He even placed a small kiss on her monitor, which made Anika giggle even as she was becoming more aroused.</p>
<p>The attention only made Anika's need grow more intense, to the point where she wanted to push his head down so that he would finally satisfy her blossoming need. He got to her skirt and pushed it up. He began kissing his way up and down her thighs and Anika groaned as her anticipation built. He was getting close to her pussy, which now ached with need. She was loving every second of it.</p>
<p>Adam breathed on her pussy and Anika moaned. Then he slowly began kissing her through her panties. Bur rather than sate her desire, it only stimulated it.</p>
<p>"No," she moaned. "Don't tease me like that."</p>
<p>But he continued to tease her, licking and kissing her everywhere except her needy clit, slowly mapping out her most sensitive and responsive areas. She writhed on the bed, trying to angle her hips up into him. She grasped his head, trying to force him to the right place. But he held her hips down and continued to torment her. And Anika's need built and built.</p>
<p>Finally, he moved back and let go of her hips. He roughly grabbed the straps of her panties. Anika instinctively raised her ass off the bed and he tugged them over her big hips and down her legs. He took a moment to look at her unveiled pussy. Her lips were wet and her clitoris was throbbing just south of her reddish-brown pubic hair. Anika groaned at feeling her smoldering cunt exposed to the air.</p>
<p>Adam couldn't hold back anymore and began kissing and licking her pussy, working his way up to her hard little clit. Anika cried out softly. In her dreams and fantasies, he'd been good at oral sex and now he was making them all come true. She'd had boyfriends go own on her but only as foreplay. And she rarely came from it. Adam was eating her out as though it were the only thing on his mind. And the need that had been building all morning was focusing down to an intense climax.</p>
<p>Adam had always loved going down on women. But he'd never found such an instant chemistry with a partner. He wasn't even thinking about it, going on instinct, letting her body tell him what it wanted. And her moans and squeaks of pleasure were making him unbelievably hard.</p>
<p>Anika gently put her hands on his head to encourage him. Her hips began to roll and jerk with anticipation. Her breath became erratic. She tried to hold back the climax and savor the moment. But Adam was relentless, aggressively kissing and sucking on her clit, finding the most sensitive areas of her lips, getting better at pleasing her with each passing moment.</p>
<p>"You're going to make me cum," she moaned.</p>
<p>Her words spurred him to attack her pussy with even greater ferocity. She gasped as she lost control and her orgasm began bearing down on her like a freight train. She bit her lip to keep from screaming as it exploded through her body. She thrashed on the bed as waves of pleasure erupted from her pussy. Adam kept going but it was too intense and she had to push him away. She lay there for a full minute as her body slowly came down off it high. Adam could only watch, enjoying the sight he'd wanted to see for so long.</p>
<p>When she finally recovered and her beautiful eyes opened again, Adam lay on top of her, his big cock pressing against her mons. And they kissed slowly and lingeringly.</p>
<p>"I don't think I've ever cum that hard," she said with a slight laugh.</p>
<p>"I try."</p>
<p>"Everyone tries. You're amazing. Where'd you learn to do that?"</p>
<p>"From you. Just listening to your body."</p>
<p>She wriggled against him. His cock felt enormous against her and her body was already getting ready for more. She didn't think she'd ever been this wet. She pulled him close.</p>
<p>"I need you inside me," she whispered into his ear. She thrilled as Adam's body jolted against her. She looked him in the eyes, saw the delight there and nodded.</p>
<p>Without another word, she rolled Adam onto his back. She helped him pull off his shirt and pants, leaving him in a pair of boxers that were obscenely distorted. She lay on her side and kissed him as she reached into his underwear. His cock felt impossibly thick.</p>
<p>"You're a big boy, aren't you?"</p>
<p>He nodded giddily.</p>
<p>"I've never had a big one before," she said, beginning to stroke him. Adam moaned.</p>
<p>"You'll have to take it easy on me," she cooed. "At least, at first. I'm just a little thing, after all. And it's been so long. Maybe you won't fit."</p>
<p>"I'll make it fit," he growled. He reached down and peeled down his boxers. Anika felt something massive against her bare thigh.</p>
<p>"Is that a third leg," she giggled. "Or are you just happy to see me?"</p>
<p>"I'm always happy to see you," he said as his hands returned to caressing her body. Anika closed her eyes and moaned. She loved the way he touched her -- gentle, but aggressive. She rolled back onto him and ground against his big cock as her arousal grew again. Her pussy began to feel empty, needing to be filled.</p>
<p>Anika finally looked down and gasped at what she saw. Her memory had not done justice to Adam's thick nine-inch cock. She slid down on the bed until she was face-to-face with it.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>"That is a big cock," she giggled. "How was your little ex able to walk after taking that?"</p>
<p>Anika began stroking his big erection, fascinated by its ridiculous size. She bent down and licked it. But the big head would barely fit into her mouth. She kissed and licked along the sides, savoring every inch.</p>
<p>Adam began to moan. He wasn't used to this kind of attention. Only Yuliya had ever attacked his cock with such enthusiasm and she hadn't been as skilled. He closed his eyes and lay back, his head still spinning that this was actually happening.</p>
<p>For a few minutes, Anika continued her attentions. Adam's balls began to get heavy with cum as she teased his release. He wanted to hold out so that they could have sex, but she was pushing him closer and closer to an enormous eruption. He clenched against the bed as he resigned himself to cumming in her talented mouth.</p>
<p>But Anika couldn't take it any longer. She would have loved to make him cum this way but she desperately needed to be filled. She sat up and stripped off her skirt, leaving herself completely naked. And then she climbed up on her new lover.</p>
<p>"I need you inside me," she said.</p>
<p>Adam's eyes lit up. She looked so beautiful aroused. Her face was flushed, her eyes glowing, her deep breaths made her big tits rise and fall. He put his hands on her full hips and savored the curve to her narrow waist.</p>
<p>"I think I've wanted you since I met you," was all he could say.</p>
<p>"I know," she answered.</p>
<p>Anika lined her soaked pussy up with his massive cock. She shuddered as the big head touched her lips. She'd never taken anything close to this big. She was both thrilled and nervous. She rubbed him back and forth against the lips of her pussy, letting a little bit slip between them, her wetness coating his swollen glans.</p>
<p>Adam groaned. He had dreamt about this moment for so long. He couldn't believe it was about to happen. Anika had gotten him so close and he worried that he might blow the second he was inside her. But the feeling was too exquisite to ignore. He tried to think about something else to delay his climax, but nothing could distract him from the reality that he was about to have sex with this goddess.</p>
<p>Finally, she pushed down. She gasped as her pussy blossomed open to accommodate his girth. She paused for a moment, letting her vagina adjust to him, rocking back and forth, slowly letting a little bit more in. She stopped again after taking half his cock, feeling more full than she ever had in her life. The sensation was unbelievably intense.</p>
<p>"Is it too big?" asked Adam.</p>
<p>"No," said Anika hurriedly. "It's great. I just ... need to get used to you. Like I said, it's been a long time. And you are way bigger than anyone else I've been with."</p>
<p>She began to slowly ride him, moaning as his fat penis stimulated every little bit of her pussy and ground against her clit. She realized there was no such thing as a casual encounter with Adam. This cock meant business. She felt his head against her cervix and jumped a bit.</p>
<p>"Is it OK if I can't take all of you?" asked Anika between gasps.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Adam. "It's fucking great."</p>
<p>She giggled slightly. For a moment, it was so ridiculous, the idea that she was having sex with Rachel's brother and his horse cock. But as the discomfort gave way to pleasure and the pleasure began to build, she realized it wasn't silly. It was really good.</p>
<p>"I think ... I think I like your cock," she said. Her body began to relax though the pelvis and she slid down a bit further. She was enjoying the stretching sensation, enjoying being so full. It felt animalistic.</p>
<p>Within minutes, it began to feel amazing. She was now riding his entire length, posting up and down, letting all but a few inches out and then pushing back down. The stimulation through her entire pussy was unbelievable.</p>
<p>"Adam," she moaned. "You have no idea how good this feels."</p>
<p>Adam could barely speak. Anika's pussy felt amazing -- unbelievably tight but wet and yielding. The way she seemed to pull him in, the way her pussy squeezed every inch of him. And, of course, the sight of this beautiful woman riding him, eyes closed with pleasure. The sound of her voice moaning and cooing. This was everything he'd wanted for months. It was even better than he'd dreamed.</p>
<p>"You have no idea how good *this* feels," Adam managed to grunt out.</p>
<p>Anika grinned and began riding him harder and harder as her excitement built. She was now rolling her hips to press his massive cock against her most sensitive areas. And when Adam put his fingers between her legs to simultaneously stimulate her clit, she almost screamed with arousal.</p>
<p>"You're going to make me cum again," she moaned. "I'm going to cum so hard for you."</p>
<p>She felt like she was losing control, that Adam's big cock and talented fingers were making it impossible not to cum. Her hips were moving of their own accord, working his massive cock back and forth, instinctively pushing her toward an explosive climax. She closed her eyes as she rushed toward the falls again.</p>
<p>Adam could barely hold on as she rode him with absolute abandon. He'd fantasized about this exact moment for so long and she as far more beautiful and far sexier than even his wildest imaginations. It was only his surprise that kept him from cumming.</p>
<p>She suddenly stopped riding him and her eyes went wide. And then she bit down a cry as her orgasm came crashing down around her, her pussy convulsing over Adam's big penis. Adam pulled her close and began thrusting up into her. And this time she did cry out as the feeling became overwhelmingly intense.</p>
<p>"Oh my ... you ... Adam!"</p>
<p>Waves of painful pleasure rolled through her body. She shook with ecstasy. And just when she thought she couldn't take any more, she came down off the mighty wave into a warm hazy bliss. She collapsed against him, barely aware of his hands caressing her and his still-hard cock making slow gentle thrusts deep into her, dragging out the denouement.</p>
<p>After a minute, she opened her eyes and she took a deep breath. She kissed Adam over and over again and then put her face against his and laughed.</p>
<p>"Wow. If I'd known you'd make me cum like that, I'd have climbed on you months ago."</p>
<p>Without a word, Adam rolled her over. He resumed, making long deep strokes into her, each of which made her shake. Despite her exhaustion, Anika moaned with delight. The way his boy-like wonder turned into naked animal aggression so quickly sent her excitement rocketing back up. This was what she'd wanted for so long: to just be taken without mercy like she was a bitch in heat. She didn't feel like another orgasm was possible but she was loving this, feeling a mixture of intensity and pleasure that was just shy of pain. It was like a continuous mid-level climax. No man had ever dominated her like this and she loved it.</p>
<p>Adam had never been this aroused. His entire being was focused on their frantic coupling, heightening every sensation. The way her pussy squeezed him, the way her big tits jiggled with every thrust, the way her arms and legs wrapped around him, the way her big hips took everything he had to give, her little moans of encouragement. His cock began to fill, like he was ready to burst in her. But he couldn't slow down, he was so lost in the moment.</p>
<p>She pulled him in close and he slowed the frenetic pace.</p>
<p>"I've wanted this for a long time too," she whispered into his ear.</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>She giggled slightly. "Really. I didn't realize it until this morning. But this is exactly what I wanted."</p>
<p>Adam kissed her again, savoring the exquisite taste of her lips.</p>
<p>"I never thought this would happen," he said, kissing her on the face. "But it's even better than I imagined. You're better than I imagined."</p>
<p>"Cum inside me," she whispered. "I want your cum inside me."</p>
<p>"You're not on the pill," he said.</p>
<p>"It's OK, I'm in my safe time. Fill me up. Don't even think about it."</p>
<p>Those words made Adam go almost wild, thrusting his big cock as hard and as deep as he could into his beautiful lover. And if Anika had thought he was fucking her hard before, she was mistaken. Anika was climaxed out but the sensations still felt amazing. She felt a warm happiness knowing she was pleasing him, that he found her so arousing, that she had elicited such an animalistic response from him.</p>
<p>"I made that big thing so hard," she thought with a grin. "And I'm going to make it cum."</p>
<p>His thrusts changed as he passed the point of no return, becoming almost frantic. His cock was so full it was like it was going to explode. Her excitement rose again as she knew she had no choice now; Adam was going to inseminate her whether she wanted him to or not. She pulled his head close and whispered into his ear.</p>
<p>"Do it. cum inside me. I'm yours."</p>
<p>With a final grunt, he pushed all the way inside her and let go. He gasped as the biggest load of his life surged through his cock and into the girl of his dreams. He felt like it would never end.</p>
<p>Anika grinned in satisfaction as his cock twitched and fired inside her, depositing rope after rope of thick semen against her cervix. Her body responded instinctively, moving her hips to allow him deeper, pulling him closer with her legs, squeezing every last drop out of him. The sounds of their fucking slowed but intensified as his abundant semen began to overflow and leak from her overstuffed pussy. Little rivulets ran over her ass and onto the bed.</p>
<p>"I'm his woman," Anika thought. "I'm his woman and he's trying to get me pregnant."</p>
<p>And then her own body surprised her by having one last orgasm. Not as intense as the ones earlier, but more a slow burn of pleasure that left her with what she'd needed for so many months; a feeling of complete satisfaction. She briefly wanted to tell him that she loved him, even thought that wasn't true. Not yet, at any rate.</p>
<p>Adam was finally spent and collapsed on top of her. They lay there for a moment in the afterglow, both gasping for air. Adam kissed her slowly and sensually. Then he rolled off of her and just lay there silently, stroking her hair, almost dizzy with happiness.</p>
<p>"I've wanted that pretty much since I met you," he said.</p>
<p>"I haven't," she said and they both laughed. "But I don't think it was long before I did. It just took me a while to realize it. I kept telling myself that it was just the quarantine talking."</p>
<p>"You're sure it wasn't?"</p>
<p>She rolled over touched his sweaty face.</p>
<p>"No, it wasn't. That's what I realized last night. And that was before you gave me the best fuck of my life."</p>
<p>"Do you want to go again?" he said.</p>
<p>Anika looked down and, unbelievably, saw that he was semi-hard. She marveled that even in this state, he was bigger than anyone she'd been with before. He reached for her but she pushed his hands away.</p>
<p>"Just a minute, stud," she laughed. "I need a moment. Blood sugar and all that. I tend to crash after sex. Especially after ... wow."</p>
<p>Her phone beeped.</p>
<p>"Yeah, that'll be the crash coming."</p>
<p>She started to get up but Adam touched her arm.</p>
<p>"I got it. Be right back."</p>
<p>Anika felt a little glow as he got up and hurried toward the kitchen. Max had always seemed a bit put out by her needs in these moments. But Adam just accepted it as part of who she was, just as he had since they'd become roommates.</p>
<p>"Adam?" she said. He stopped and turned. She looked over him again, now as her lover. His big semi-hard cock dangling between his legs, his strong arms and that face that was now dear to her.</p>
<p>"There's no rush. You have me all day."</p>
<p>Adam took a second to look at her, lying naked in his bed, her delectable body covered in sweat but glowing with happiness. He'd worried that he'd been infatuated -- that maybe once he'd had her, he'd lose interest. But she looked more beautiful than ever. He wanted to take her again right this second. And his heart, which had felt heavy in his chest for months, now felt light as a feather.</p>
<p>"Oh, I completely intend to have you all day."</p>
<p>Anika lay back in bed, absently checking her devices to make sure Adam hadn't dislodged them in his passion. As she did, her phone beeped again. She picked it up but it wasn't her monitor. It was a text message from Rachel.</p>
<p>Hey, Anika. Hate to text you this early. You probably already know Adam got laid off.</p>
<p>I can't be there to support him but I'm glad you are. Look out for him, will you?</p>
<p>Anika giggled. She was tempted to text back, "Well, I just let him fuck my brains out, so maybe that will help." But she just put the phone down and lay there in the morning sunlight. She'd always felt nervous and vulnerable after having sex with a guy for the first time. But this was different. She instead felt contended for the first time since the quarantine had begun.</p>
<p>Five months later</p>
<p>In a few days, it would be the anniversary of their unplanned moving in together. Anika couldn't help but laugh at the thought of that day: their inadvertent mutual exposure and her certainty that she would be getting rid of him as soon as possible. Who would have thought that a year later, she'd be completely in love with him?</p>
<p>The last five months had been some of the happiest of Anika's life. The sudden and explosive unraveling of their sexual tension had not damaged their friendship. They were closer than ever. Their routine was just more openly affectionate. Instead of sitting on opposite ends of the couch watching TV, she lay with her head in his lap while he toyed with her hair. Instead of sleeping apart, they'd pushed the beds together. When they went into their respective offices to work, they kissed "goodbye". And if the goodbye kiss led to them occasionally being a few minutes late for work, that was fine.</p>
<p>And she had never known such sexual satisfaction was possible. They went at it four or five times a week and he never failed to make her cum her brains out. They'd lived out every fantasy either of them had had in the months leading up to their first time and some she hadn't even known she'd had. He'd taken her in every room in the tiny apartment, including the shower. They'd gone down on each other while on Zoom calls. They'd had romantic trysts in bed and spontaneous fucks on the floor. She'd sent him sexy messages while he was just in the next room and then waited, giddy with anticipation, for the sheet walling off his office to fly open and for him to drag her into the bedroom. Or just take her right there at her desk or against the nearest wall. She felt like she was finally realizing her full sexuality.</p>
<p>She'd also finished and defended her dissertation. And she now had a job offer from a biotech firm down in Pittsburgh. Adam had found a temporary programming job but was looking for work in Pittsburgh as well -- there had never been a question of whether he was going to move with her. There was talk, once they got vaccinated, of seeing his family. And maybe hers.</p>
<p>Rachel, of course, was ecstatic that they'd finally gotten together. When they'd finally told Rachel, she'd called up, in tears, saying, "You're my two favorite people and it makes me so happy." Anika would have found the enthusiasm annoying except for the giddiness she felt when Rachel said she'd never known Adam to be so happy. He'd gotten the girl he'd been pining for and it had turned out to be amazing.</p>
<p>She had another teleconference with her new employers that afternoon and was getting dressed for the occasion. As she pulled her bra on, she noticed it was quite tight. She'd always been a bit big for a 36D, especially at certain times of the month, but now it was barely fitting. And she was really noticing it today as her boobs were somewhat tender and sore and not really wanting to be squeezed into a bra that was too small for them.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a thought struck her out of the blue.</p>
<p>"When was my last period?"</p>
<p>Anika was used to having an irregular menstrual cycle. But it suddenly occurred to her that it had been seven weeks.</p>
<p>She raced into the bathroom and started fumbling under the sink. Finally, she found it: a pink box with a pregnancy test in it. It was from long before the quarantine and had expired a month ago but she was sure it was still good.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, she sat in the kitchen, watching the test, waiting to see if the second bar would appear. She felt odd though. This was not the first time she'd had a pregnancy scare. And it had always been scary. But she was not scared now. She was anxious, yes. But it was almost anticipation she felt, not fear.</p>
<p>She knew when it might have happened. She'd gotten the job offer late on a Thursday. To celebrate, they'd rented a cabin upstate. But they'd spent the entire weekend in bed. Since it was only a few days after her period, she'd let him cum inside her over and over again. She remembered one particular moment. She'd been on her back, orgasmed out. And he'd cum massively inside her. She hadn't climaxed but she'd felt a closeness to him that was unreal. She vaguely remembered wanting him to get her pregnant in the moment but then dismissing the thought as passion-induced silliness later that evening, while she sat on the couch next to him, his abundant semen still leaking out of her and, apparently, one of the hundreds of millions of healthy sperm he'd put into her burrowing its way into her egg.</p>
<p>She heard the door to the apartment open and saw Adam's familiar form enter. She glanced down again. The second bar was now appearing rapidly. A wave went through her -- of excitement, nervousness, fear.</p>
<p>"You remember how we joked when this thing began about all the quarantine babies?" she said, looking up at him.</p>
<p>"Yeaaaah," he said slowly.</p>
<p>"Well ... funny story ..."</p>
<p>THE END</p>
