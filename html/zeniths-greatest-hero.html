<h1>Chapter 0</h1>
<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>The following takes place in a fairly generic D&amp;D-like fantasy world (called Zenith), it is a stand-alone story, not part of any wider cannon, with focus on character rather than world. So don't be dissuaded by mentions of previous adventures or magical systems, they are not the focus of the story.</p>
<p>The focus of the story is exposure and self-humiliation so if those aren't for you I'm afraid you're not going to like this one.</p>
<p>"I'm still not entirely sure what you do. Is it magic?" Valda asked, uncomfortable with the plush office she found herself in, looking around for somewhere she felt comfortable leaving her mythical greataxe.</p>
<p>"Nothing so crude. The healing temple referred you to me with problems with your mental health, no spell can simply fix your mind as it isn't 'broken' per say, just in need of guidance along its journey." The half-drow therapist explained while the giant barbarian flopped on her couch, almost breaking it and the floor beneath it.</p>
<p>"I'm not forking out fifty gold pieces a session to meet a bard who can't even do bardic magic." Valda snottily replied, picking some sharpened animal bones out of her pouch to pick at her teeth.</p>
<p>"Then what are you forking out fifty gold pieces a session for? If I was an all-powerful wizard who could wave a magic wand and make you the person you wanted to be, what kind of person would walk out of my office in an hour's time?"</p>
<p>"I dunno, I guess..." Valda began before bashfully quietening up, looking suspiciously around the room.</p>
<p>"Don't worry Valda, the therapist guild is fantastic at providing privacy spells. Nobody can hear what you say or spy on our sessions while you are in this room with the door closed, and my professional practice is entirely predicated on maintaining your privacy. Your ability to speak candidly is vital to my work and I do whatever is needed to ensure that."</p>
<p>"It's fine, so what no healer has managed to achieve, the reason they are sending me to you, is that I no longer feel like myself. I want to feel like I once was. Does that sound stupid?"</p>
<p>"Not at all. One of the reasons your problem does not have a magical fix is because no magic can tell you who you are."</p>
<p>"Magic can't, but half the scrolls in the libraries can. Valda Stormaxe, final vanquisher of Dark Lord Killshade, the most powerful wizard in Zenith." Valda ran her hand through her brown mohican, chuckling at the memory of the months of parades and accolades she received just because it was her axe that finished the job. Her friends got plenty of glory for their part in the fight, but she became the centrepiece. "About 7 years ago, my friends and I swore vengeance after our village was raised to the ground and our parents murdered. I had six years of fighting the forces of evil, saving villages from nearby beasties, breaking curses, hell I single handedly slayed a nycaloth."</p>
<p>"Legends tell of your deeds, what do you remember most of those times?"</p>
<p>"Purpose, pride..." Valda paused in deep thought. "Adventure. The world was filled with fixable evils, and not only could I fix them with my axe, but I was getting better by making the world better. Now they're putting up statues of me on the road of heroes while I sit in my house deciding which charities should get my gold, which causes I can endorse, my muscles atrophying and my skin becoming pale and smooth while I try to do right with my axe on the stand."</p>
<p>The drow therapist never would have guessed Valda's body was less hardy. She still cut an imposing muscular figure, her hardened and scarred skin still carrying the deep tan of months questing under a burning sun. Even now she had traded her trademark mystical animal skin loincloths with a smart outfit made of leathers and furs that was more in keeping with urban life, she still stood out as someone as deadly as they were revered. Her therapist was far more comfortable with living in a city, her formal white suit colour coordinated to match her silver hair and contrast with her dark skin, a professional veneer to calm even the wildest of beasts that found themselves needing her help.</p>
<p>"My strength comes from rage, I can't just put that down because I no longer have anything worth raising my axe to. Everything is either beneath me or too big for me. So my rage just stews."</p>
<p>"So what have you been doing with your time?" The therapist asked.</p>
<p>"When I have time I go to the arena, the one in Towerkeep has strength draining glyphs, people are willing to spar with me if I slap a couple on. Still win every time though."</p>
<p>"It seems like you are trying to recapture the good times with imitations of them. But they're not going to have the same emotional impact. Have you considered trying different types of adventures? Finding something about you that seems daunting, or makes you fearful, then charging at that head-on?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I miss the fear before the rage." Valda mused.</p>
<p>"So what do you fear? If I told you that I was going to cast a spell of fear on you right now, what would go through your mind?" This question stumped Valda, she was no stranger to fear spells but when she was in the thick of battle it always preyed on a fear that she would not overcome the evildoers, if anything that only made her angrier. She hadn't thought about what she now feared.</p>
<p>"I fear that I will never be challenged again."</p>
<p>"That is a hell of a breakthrough, I'm afraid that it has come at the end of the session, but it certainly gives us room to grow. I'll book you in a session next week, and before that session I want you to do one thing that makes you feel vulnerable." The therapist advised, finalising her notes.</p>
<p>"Alright." Valda confirmed, getting to her feet. "I'll think about that. Thanks, umm..."</p>
<p>"Qilue." The therapist intervened, realising that the conversation had gotten started so quickly she had not introduced herself. "Dr. Qilue Mylyl."</p>
<p>"Thanks Dr. Mylyl, I'll give it a go."</p>
<p>Qilue straightened up her office as best she could. It needed to be pristine, not for her next client, the barbarian certainly didn't care for such refinement, but to feel at peace with herself. Valda was the most famous person in Zenith, to be a therapist to Valda Stormaxe meant Qilue felt the weight of being the representative of the therapists guild, the best of them, and the best therapist in Zenith certainly didn't have a messy office. She straightened up her smart outfit and hoped that Valda had gained enough from their first session to want to return. Her anxieties were relieved when Valda strutted through the door with a grin on her face.</p>
<p>"Hello Valda, you seem in a good mood today." Qilue observed showing her into the office.</p>
<p>"I am, I took your advice and then I took it again. It's been an enlightening week."</p>
<p>"I'm very happy to hear that. I also noticed you don't have your axe with you today. You are always free to do whatever makes my office feel comfortable and secure."</p>
<p>"Oh there's a reason for that, besides you are the last person I plan on smiting." Valda chirped as she closed the door behind her. "So your homework, it took a lot of thinking but I figured out something I found daunting. So you were saying about me seeking imitations of my past life right, well I realised I was carrying them around with me everywhere."</p>
<p>Valda opened her pouch and pulled out a list scribbled in erratic handwriting.</p>
<p>"So that axe was enchanted with a whole mess of spells to do more damage. My loincloth gave me a constitution buff and resist elements, my shoes made me run faster, I was covered in buffs and protections just to visit a therapist." Qilue raised an eyebrow. "So I tried walking through town without any enchantments, just me."</p>
<p>"I see, and that made you feel vulnerable?"</p>
<p>"It helped but no, I was still protected by my identity, everyone bows and scrapes at my very presence, something I never noticed until I walk around without my enchanted items. So I bought this!" Valda pulled a ring out of her pouch, then dramatically placed it over her finger and let Qilue watch as her facial features morphed, her skin lightened, and illusionary blonde hair sprouted out of her head. "See, now I'm no longer Valda Stormaxe, I'm just some unknown large woman."</p>
<p>"I see, and how did it feel walking down the street as someone else?"</p>
<p>"It felt great, but I haven't gotten to that bit yet. When I walked down the street in the disguise I felt better, but you told me to feel vulnerable and I still felt very much safe. The way I saw it, my whole adult life was about getting stronger, it is a part of my identity, the loss of a few enchantments and a quick face change wasn't going to make me feel different. I had to leave behind everything that protected me."</p>
<p>"I see," Qilue replied, hurriedly scratching down notes and mentally preparing speeches about reckless self-endangerment, but not willing to interrupt Valda sharing her journey. "I hope you still managed to stay safe."</p>
<p>"That's the best part, I didn't. Every time I went out I was acutely aware of what crutches I was relying on to give me comfort and one by one I removed them. I was reliant on being in a nice area of town with plenty of town guards, so I started doing my walks in Blackbough where they don't patrol. Then I was aware that daylight was reassuring me, so I walked through Blackbough late at night while thieves and criminals creeped in the shadows. While walking at night I saw the drunks and the prostitutes and I realised how much my civility was a sheild."</p>
<p>"How did you remove your civility?" Qilue asked, interested in Valda's thought process.</p>
<p>"Well, you see..." Valda started, pausing to giggle uncontrollably at the memory of the evening. "I walked from the alleyway behind the temple of Beshaba, to an apartment I rented above the pawnbrokers, wearing nothing but my ring of disguise, basically totally naked." Valda fell into laughter while Qilue gripped her notepad tighter. Any other client and she would have been cutting her off, lest her erratic behaviour come back to be a stain on her counseling record, but Valda was different and dangerous.</p>
<p>"You think that was wise?"</p>
<p>"No! Of course not, that was the point, I was rushing into it as a headstrong moron with nothing to lose, just like in the old days."</p>
<p>"And how did your walk go?" Qilue asked through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>"So at first I was super nervous, I was sneaking around hoping nobody would see me. My heart was beating a mile a minute avoiding the reprobates out late that night. As I was sneaking past some bins a drunkard looked right at me, I bet he thought he was dreaming. Then, when I was just across the road from my house, some stranger came out of nowhere and grabbed my ass. Well I squealed then practically tore his arm off, I wonder if anyone at the healing temples will believe his story?" The maniacal grin on Valda's face was starting to worry Qilue.</p>
<p>"So after being caught, you realised how risky your behaviour was?" She asked, trying to steer the conversation back to moderation.</p>
<p>"Um... actually the opposite." Valda replied, starting to show some bashfulness of her actions. "So don't be mad..."</p>
<p>"Valda, even if I showed any judgement towards your actions, you shouldn't be worried about my opinion, I want you to share with me even if it is embarrassing. When you do feel shame, it should come from a feeling of falling short of what you owe to yourself, not my validation."</p>
<p>"Alright, well I replayed that walk over and over in my mind, especially during lonely moments at night, and with a bit of breathing space I realised I still wasn't vulnerable. Someone caught me and I easily overpowered him, that's probably the worst it could have gone. So I went to the arena in Towerkeep and I borrowed some strength draining glyphs." Qilue hid her shock and disappointment, they both knew this was not healthy behaviour, but Valda was eager to tell her tale and Qilue was eager to listen.</p>
<p>"From my sparring sessions I know how my body reacts to the glyphs. I can handle up to 7 before I can no longer walk. The next night, behind the temple of Beshaba, I stripped naked but for the ring, then applied 6 glyphs. I was completely helpless." Qilue leaned forward, her professional decorum beginning to be lost to personal curiosity.</p>
<p>"I was never stealthy, it was never a skill I needed, but I swear that night I was channeling everything I ever learned from Melwyn, my friend who became a rogue. I hid in the shadows before sprinting across walkways and roads. I even fell over a couple of times, not used to my lack of strength. But I kept my wits about me and almost nothing went wrong."</p>
<p>"Almost nothing?"</p>
<p>"So at one point I had to dive into an alleyway without checking ahead of myself, and I landed at the feet of a prostitute taking a break between johns. She was shocked to see me, then she was angry, sge thought I was some new girl, trying to steal her clients with a unique marketing strategy. Suddenly she starts screaming at me, slapping and kicking me, throwing me out into the street in front of laughing by-standers. I have a battle hardened constitution so I barely felt any of it, but I couldn't fight back. They didn't know it but everyone on that street saw Valda Stormaxe, hero of Zenith, naked and beaten by a common whore. I managed to scurry away and nobody followed me, the whore let the crowd know that anyone who did anything with me would have to answer to her pimp."</p>
<p>"That sounds like quite an experience." Qilue remarked, desperately holding back her shock. "So we now need to look beyond that to how you integrate what you learned into your life, without putting yourself at risk. Can I ask you about your sex life?"</p>
<p>"So dead not even Infernazarr could bring it back. Infernazarr was my necromancer friend, he could raise whole armies of skeletons to do his bidding, I make a large portion of my gold from my shares in his construction business."</p>
<p>"Well maybe that's it, you miss your old sexual exploits, what if we took away the risk and harm, and instead looked at getting you back to the sex life you once had." Qilue jumped in, happy to have an avenue of enquiry that didn't put her client in danger.</p>
<p>"OK, when I said dead that wasn't entirely accurate. Things that are dead were once alive, my sex life never existed. I was always focussed on taking down Lord Killshade, my battle companions brothers in arms not lovers in arms. Now whenever I try to strike up some sort of relationship, men are genuinely afraid I'll snap them in two." Valda admitted, calming down from the memory of her ordeal to go back to the drudgery of psychotherapy.</p>
<p>"Well there we go, the sexuality of the experience was novel to you, so you conflated the sexual thrill with the thrill of exposure and vulnerability. Let's see if we can build up a sexual identity for you that's safer than being beaten naked by a prostitute on a public street." Qilue seized on the breakthrough.</p>
<p>"I suppose," Valda reasoned with a sigh.</p>
<p>Qilue sat on a sofa in an entirely different office. This was the supervision room for the Guild of Therapists, a place where therapists were required to discuss their cases with another therapist, both to check they're care plans are right and to ensure their patients don't start to affect their mental health. The aged figure of Gelmar Springleaf stroked his beard pensively as Qilue recounted her session notes to him.</p>
<p>"Did you foresee that Valda would react this way to the homework you gave her?" He slowly asked.</p>
<p>"Of course, I always wanted to put the hero of Zenith at great physical and emotional risk." Qilue sarcastically replied.</p>
<p>"Alright, I agree it was a poor way to phrase the question. What did you have in mind when you set that homework?" He rephrased.</p>
<p>"Well what Valda considered a vulnerable action was to be as enlightening as her performing that action. Given the physicality of her life I assumed vulnerability would be an emotional state, like seeing a sad play or being honest with someone she loved."</p>
<p>"And yet you chose not to guideline your homework in those terms?"</p>
<p>"I didn't want to stifle her introspection. Once she had told her story I discovered the scale of her non-sexual past, so I steered the session to the development of healthy expressions of sexuality."</p>
<p>"It must have been quite shocking to hear of such a towering figure, one our lands hold so much reverence for, acting in such a way. How did it make you feel?"</p>
<p>"It certainly required an adjustment in my preconceived notions of heroes. Not to mention that the society we live in didn't stop idolising her just because I saw the person behind the legend. My walk here goes down the road of heroes, I passed the statue of her and it made me giggle." Qilue admitted. "But to be honest, maybe it's just a factor of the life she lives, but I was very drawn into the story of her adventure. The only difference between her legend of the vanquishing of the void wraith of Eternalake, and her tale of defeat at the hands of the prostitute of Blackbough, was the scale."</p>
<p>"I don't understand."</p>
<p>"They were both adventures. They were both tales of threat and overcoming obstacles. I enjoyed hearing of it as much as I would enjoy whatever theatrical production is currently on. I of course did not let on about this, one can enjoy with a critical eye as long as the critical eye is what guides one's practice." Qilue explained.</p>
<p>"I see, well you seem to be responding well to a unique client, just remember professional boundaries and I'm sure our guild will come out of this with our highest profile endorsement yet. Now how are things going with the man who thinks everything is a mimic?"</p>
<p>"Hello again Valda. How was your week?" Qilue cheerfully chirped as Valda sulked into the room. She didn't say a word until the door was closed, then flopped onto the sofa, the creaking wood letting Qilue know she had made the right choice to have a local carpenter reinforce it..</p>
<p>"Disastrous."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to hear that. What went wrong?"</p>
<p>"Well for starters, when I was in a good mood last week I agreed to do a whole bunch of stuff this week, charity and temple appearances, it was exhausting. Then I remembered what you said about sexuality with boundaries, and I decided to take matters into my own hands and hire a male prostitute. I put on a new ring of disguise and met him at the secret apartment in Blackbough so word wouldn't get out. Lots of safety and planning." Although Qilue had told Valda not to seek her approval, she still gave a smile at the level of thought Valda had given to creating a safe sexual space for herself.</p>
<p>"So he arrives, big strapping lad, going for the whole muscular stable boy look, not something I objected to. We started playing around right away, I wasn't in the mood for a chat. I offer to bend over a table for him so I wouldn't risk crushing him with my muscular thighs. He thrusts inside of me and... and..." Valda collapsed into fits of sobs. Qilue passed her some tissues and assured her that she could continue with her story in her own time. She dried her eyes, gave a huge sniff, then squeezed her eyes closed and yelled.</p>
<p>"My pelvic muscles crushed his penis."</p>
<p>Qilue forgot herself for a moment and burst out laughing, taking a few seconds to regain her composure.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, that was unprofessional of me."</p>
<p>"It's alright, I suppose it is a little funny. I'm so supernaturally buff, no mortal man can conquer my vagina." Valda announced with sarcastic fanfare. "If in being honest I wanted my first time to be memorable and that certainly fit the bill."</p>
<p>"So what lessons are you taking away from this?" Qilue asked, never having dealt with this kind of problem before.</p>
<p>"When I get over this experience and decide to try again, I could get the strength draining glyphs back, weaken myself so I don't cripple anyone brave enough to fuck me." Valda reasoned.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>"In the short term that's a good idea, but we need to be careful going down this path. If you always attach weakening glyphs before sex, eventually your mind will form a link between being weakened and sexual pleasure. That will put you in some very dangerous headspaces, maybe even dangerous situations like the one a fortnight ago."</p>
<p>"Still enjoyed that more than paying off a screaming stable boy as he sprinted to a healing temple." Valda mused.</p>
<p>"Have you ever wanted to sleep with someone who you hadn't paid for?" Qilue asked.</p>
<p>"I was always attracted to strength, in myself and others. Ever since I started bench pressing cows I haven't really met anyone humanoid who could take me."</p>
<p>"I see, maybe it would be worth re-evaluating what you want from life and from sex. Use that ring of disguise to meet new people, maybe you'll find someone you're willing to be vulnerable for, or maybe you will discover that vulnerability is not the only way to love, both in others and yourself."</p>
<p>"So it would be like a holiday away from my life. Leave Valda behind and see what's left." Valda reasoned. "I could do that."</p>
<p>Qilue had given Valda a couple of weeks to find herself before scheduling the next appointment. She couldn't help but admit that she was looking forward to the session. Valda's position in society had given her such a warped view of self-actualisation, Qilue was unbearably curious to find out how Valda had manifested time away from herself.</p>
<p>Qilue sat quietly in her office, waiting for the tinkle of her bell to herald her star client, when the door opened she practically jumped out of her chair. She was then disappointed to see a tall blonde elf shimmy past the door, brushing off her skimpy dress before sitting down on her sofa.</p>
<p>"Um, can I help you?" Qilue asked.</p>
<p>"You really don't recognise me do you?" Valda responded.</p>
<p>"Oh Valda, good to see how thoroughly that ring of disguise works on you." Qilue sighed. "So I take it this was your identity when you were not being yourself?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Helga Conifer, traveller and aspiring bard." Valda announced with a giggle, before taking off the ring and returning to her former large muscular form.</p>
<p>"So what have you discovered about yourself since we last spoke?" Qilue asked, taking her seat and picking up her notepad.</p>
<p>"It was interesting, I spent the first couple of days living out of my Blackbough apartment, just living you know. I had no responsibilities, no luxuries, and no cares. Then I realised just sitting around doing nothing was relaxing, but it wasn't helping me discover myself, so I decided to try out different lives and meet new people along the way. I managed to get a job as a bartender for a couple of nights, my boss was very handsy but I didn't smash his face in because regular people don't have that option. Then I spent some time loading and unloading boats at the docks, even working after hours to unload contraband, illegal substances and creatures. Then just to really try out all the angles I spent a day as a beggar, I've got to say the way beggars are treated in this town is really bad."</p>
<p>"This all sounds very interesting, experimenting with your life, what did you take away from these experiences?" Qilue asked, fascinated by the journey Valda had been on.</p>
<p>"Firstly that no matter what, I still can't abide injustice, I bought the tavern I worked at and fired the handsy manager, every illegal crate I unloaded got reported and seized, and I'm thinking of providing financial and reputational support to whichever temple does the best work with homeless people." Valda explained, her voice slightly monotonous with the mundanity of fighting for good.</p>
<p>"I sense this is the answer you would give a writer from a newspaper. Even if you can't be honest with yourself you can be honest with me and learn from that." Qilue explained, plastering her most reassuring smile over her face.</p>
<p>"Alright, so I know we were talking about the unhealthy thrill I get at the thought of vulnerability. I genuinely tried to distract myself from it but the lives I lived only made it worse. When my boss was feeling me up in the keg room, I loved how dirty I felt afterwards, which I know is really insulting to his other victims. When I was unloading a ship, I saw a cage and restraints they had locked a harpy in for transport and my immediate thought was how great I would feel locked up like that. I had the idea to be a beggar because I wanted to feel like the lowliest person for the day and actually enjoyed being treated that way. Several men offered me paltry amounts to sleep with them, and if I wasn't still a bit traumatised by my cock crushing vagina, I might have taken them up on the offer." Qilue watched Valda's eyes fill with that same ravenous longing that she saw when she recounted her other story and decided to step in.</p>
<p>"So you tried some new experiences and it embedded some existing damaging ideas?" Qilue asked, trying to keep the framing on these ideas as a bad thing.</p>
<p>"I'd say I tried to suppress and ignore my desires and they came back stronger." Valda retorted. "I know I have to keep myself safe and the legacy of Valda Stormaxe intact, but I don't think trying to repress these desires is going to work. I need your help to brainstorm safe and constructive ways to indulge these, maybe even a way to do so that will help me move on to less damaging desires. I mean your profession means I can trust you and you are the only person I can trust."</p>
<p>"I am happy you can trust me, but that trust is not a blank cheque for me to indulge you, I earned your trust through my responsibilities to your mental health. Of course this is a safe space but..." Qilue froze mid-sentence as Valda's face lit up with an idea, her professional eye recognising a moment of revelation and keen to give Valda space to voice her self-discovery.</p>
<p>Valda sprung to her feet and began stripping off her clothes, the skimpy peasants dress dropped to the floor and Valda sighed with relief, her underclothes weren't too dissimilar to the basic loincloths of common barbarian warriors, small scraps of animal hide roughly stitched together to form a covering. Valda pulled some thread on the back of her bra and it fell to the ground. Given her intimidating body, battle hardened to perfect muscular form, Qilue was surprised that Valda had full round tits that bounced and jiggled out of the bra, the contours of her body seamlessly moving from chiseled muscle to delicate breasts. She bent over and pulled her knickers down, placing them on her pile of clothes before sitting back down on the sofa with a huge grin plastered across her face.</p>
<p>"There." Valda responded, as if her sudden exposure was simply the answer to one of Qilue's questions.</p>
<p>"So..." Qilue began, unable to contain her shock and staring wide-eyed at every inch of Valda's naked flesh. She eventually was able to piece together enough brain cells to respond. "Is there a reason you have chosen to strip naked?"</p>
<p>"You said this is a safe space, you said that vulnerability can take the form of openness and I have been uncharacteristically open with you. If I'm being vulnerable here I might as well be totally vulnerable here." Valda reasoned.</p>
<p>"Valda, I am not a dominatrix. I don't think it's wise for you to use my authority as a tool for your sexual gratification." Qilue informed, her clear curiosity removing any sense of weight from her sentiments.</p>
<p>"I'm not gratifying myself. A couple of sessions ago you said I could do whatever I wanted to make your office feel comfortable and secure. I feel secure with you so I am getting naked to feel comfortable." Qilue knew every textbook and professional body would count this as a massive red flag. There was no way that any therapist that followed the rules (and Qilue considered herself exactly that) would allow this to continue. She thought through how she was going to let Valda down gently, the hero of Zenith was sitting naked on her sofa, telling fantastic stories of her erotic adventures, she had to put a stop to it immediately.</p>
<p>"Fair enough, if it makes you happy, you may remain naked while talking about your experiences." Qilue replied, wincing at her lapse in professionalism. "Aside from myself, how many others have seen you naked without a ring of disguise?"</p>
<p>"Since I came of age, none. Everyone has seen me in my trademark loincloth, hell it's what I'm wearing in that statue they carved, but nobody has seen under the loincloth. Is it crazy that I'm upset that there is a statue of me almost completely nude and still nobody thinks of me in a sexual way? It would probably be going a bit far to commission a new statue without the loincloth."</p>
<p>Qilue talked with Valda for some time about her relationship with her own sexuality, running way over her allotted time before regrettably calling the session to an end. Valda redressed and left Qilue alone to calm her nerves.</p>
<p>Qilue was excited to see what Valda had been up to this week, she nervously waited in her office, at one point unbuttoning the top button of her blouse before deciding against it and awkwardly buttoning it back up. Suddenly a large naked woman burst into her office. Valda took off the ring of disguise and collapsed laughing onto the sofa. Qilue disapprovingly cleared her throat.</p>
<p>"I see you have begun to include my surgery in your reckless behaviour." Qilue sternly observed.</p>
<p>"Sorry doctor, I figured if I'm going to do my sessions naked, why not save myself some time and strip off before I get here." Valda explained through fits of giggles. Qilue knew she needed to draw a line at this sort of behaviour or it would only escalate, but her personal curiosity got the better of her.</p>
<p>"How far did you walk naked?" She asked.</p>
<p>"I have an apartment and gym a few blocks from here." Valda bragged. "It's where I left my clothes. It's also where I applied these." Valda thrust out her chest so Qilue could see the row of six recurring symbols, magically dancing on her skin with glowing menace.</p>
<p>"You applied strength draining glyphs before our session. How long do they last?"</p>
<p>"The ones at the sparring arena only lasted an hour, so I got these ones specially made to last three. Nobody asked any questions as everyone knows I put on glyphs of weakening before my exercises, they just assumed I was becoming more formidable and unfuckable." Valda explained, her excitement turning to sadness at the end.</p>
<p>"And what was to be gained from including me in this?"</p>
<p>"I wanted you to see what it was like for me, to engage with me when I'm in this mindset."</p>
<p>"Would you have me beat you up like some prostitute in Blackbough? Or maybe you want me to sexually assault you? I don't know what you expected to get out of this action that could possibly be considered appropriate."</p>
<p>"I figured this was the one place on this whole stinking planet I didn't have to be appropriate." Valda erupted, standing to her full height.</p>
<p>"You seem to be working to desecrate the one place where your well-being is central, a foolish thing to do considering the path you are going down. If this blows up in your face, you need to be able to come back here and pick up the pieces of your psyche without getting flashbacks of the debauched and dangerous behaviour you indulged here. This behaviour is problematic, to associate it with the office trying to help you risks you never feeling safe and content at the same time again." Qilue ranted, standing up and staring into Valda's eyes, trying to portray strength despite the barbarian still being a couple of feet taller than her. When Valda didn't back down, Qilue just smiled and pushed her onto the sofa.</p>
<p>"Hey, you can't do that." Valda replied.</p>
<p>"Why not? Because it's not what therapists do? Well coming naked to my office is not what patients engaging with their treatment do. If the rules don't apply to you I guess they also don't apply to me." Qilue stated, pushing Valda down again as she tried to get up. "Do you want me to be looking after your mental well-being or do you want me to indulge your self-destructive behaviours? Because I can do either."</p>
<p>Valda looked confused and worried as Qilue stood over her with anger in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Surely I could just..."</p>
<p>"You will treat my office with the reverence it deserves, or I will kick you out." Qilue erupted, stopping herself in the middle of an idea. "Although if you want me to indulge this self-destructive journey to its natural conclusion, I can do that too."</p>
<p>Qilue grabbed Valda by the arm and began to drag her towards the door.</p>
<p>"No, at least let me put the ring of disguise on."</p>
<p>"No, Valda Stormaxe wants my business to be a part of her downfall, then let's be efficient shall we. I'm going to drag you into the street and yell for anyone to hear that Valda Stormaxe is currently naked, weakened, and looking forward to being raped in public by anyone who wants to." Qilue explained in a wild fury. She put one hand on the door to the outside world, then looked down at the fear in Valda's eyes and paused expectantly.</p>
<p>"Alright, I'm sorry." Valda bashfully admitted.</p>
<p>"Why are you sorry?" Qilue pressed, still holding on to her arm.</p>
<p>"For not treating you like a professional."</p>
<p>"Nope, that's not what you need to be apologising for. You have one more try before I drag you into the street." Valda's brain buzzed and processed as quickly as she could muster as Qilue's grip on the door handle tightened.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I compromised my treatment for the sake of self-destructive thrills." Valda screamed. Qilue's resolve melted to a warm smile as she let go of Valda's arm.</p>
<p>"In this office you are always welcome to do whatever you feel you need to do to express yourself, it's why I tolerated your spontaneous nudity last week. But if my office is used for these sorts of games again I will be dropping you as a client, OK?" Qilue explained, a little saddened that it had come to this.</p>
<p>"Alright." Valda dejectedly replied. "I won't drag you into this any more." Qilue knew what she should say and what she wanted to say, they were two different things. Every training session on professional boundaries and guild code on appropriate behaviour towards a client was screaming that this breakthrough needed to bridge back to a more professional relationship. But with everything she had seen so far Qilue decided to follow a different path.</p>
<p>"I don't mind observing your predicaments, I daresay it may even help with your therapy. But this office needs to have an association in your mind as a safe space of healing. How about I join you in returning to your apartment to collect your clothes?" Qilue suggested. Valda nodded, unaware of how big of a lapse in judgement her adventures had just caused in her therapist. "So where are we heading?"</p>
<p>Qilue left her office first, desperately glancing up and down the street for any sign of movement before waving out her naked client, currently covered only by the disguise her ring projected onto her. Valda ducked behind a sign for a now closed haberdasher while Qilue scouted ahead. Qilue's office was located in the back alleys of Fountainwood, the well off area of Zenith, by design so that her wealthy clients would not look conspicuously out of place but could also ensure privacy as they entered for their sessions. Valda had rented a space a short walk away, almost entirely navigable through small walkways, with the exception of the Fountainwood high street, a large thoroughfare that bisected the two blocks of buildings they had to traverse. Qilue appreciated the professional clicking of her hard shoes on the cobblestone streets, framing the occasional pause and dry slapping of the panicked run of bare feet behind her.</p>
<p>For someone whose professional life very deliberately deplores stealth, the legendary barbarian was still surprisingly good at concealing herself. Every so often Qilue would signal for her to hide as people walked by, every time Valda was somehow able to squirrel herself into a hanging doorway or behind a well placed cart or bin. Qilue found herself wondering if she would be as adept if the situation was reversed, before shaking that thought out of her mind. As they approached the high street, Qilue turned back to check on her client.</p>
<p>"So this is the most risky bit." Qilue began</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"It's possible you could be seen."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't be the first time today."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Alright I'll look weird if I'm just standing around in the street, so I'll walk across to the other side and wave you across if it is clear." Qilue explained. She calmly strolled out of the alleyway and into a thoroughfare bustling with people going about their business. She turned around and came back to Valda. "How the hell did you get across this without being seen."</p>
<p>"I didn't, I got across without getting caught." Valda proudly explained.</p>
<p>"So just wait for a gap in the crowd and make a break for it. That was your master plan?" Qilue angrily whispered.</p>
<p>"Nobody ever asked me what my plan was, we left that sort of thinking to the Bard and the Wizard." Valda sheepishly explained.</p>
<p>"Well, think of a better plan." Qilue demanded, to which Valda smiled and shrugged her shoulders. Qilue growled with frustration and walked back into the street to await the quietest moment possible.</p>
<p>Qilue waited for a gap in foot traffic that never seemed to come while she paced the road like someone unsure of where they were going. After some time she lowered her requirements to a moment where there weren't any city guards or suspicious looking people. Eventually she chose her moment and waved Valda across.</p>
<p>Valda broke into a surprisingly fast sprint, she was halfway across the busy street when the first of the by-standers even began to react to her. Qilue stared in awe as she saw Valda's determined face and bouncing breasts thundering towards her. Then as she passed Qilue watched from behind as Valda's powerful naked buttocks churned underneath her, propelling her into the darkened alleyway. Qilue took a moment to swim in the sounds of disgust and outrage from the pedestrians, closing her eyes and imagining the humiliation that Valda must be feeling before calmly walking towards the address she had been given.</p>
<p>When she arrived at Valda's apartment, a small living quarters attached to a large gym, Valda was in the bedroom furiously masturbating at memories of her adventure. Qilue decided to look around and deliberately ignore Valda as she screamed her way through her orgasm. She was in the kitchen having a drink of water when her client returned, now fully clothed.</p>
<p>"So you were aroused at all that fear and humiliation?"</p>
<p>"Deeply." Valda replied with no shame.</p>
<p>"And you realise what a perverse and unhealthy association that is?"</p>
<p>"Very much so, but I've lived a life where anyone in authority telling me no would only drive me on more, why would the same voice in my head be any different?" Valda reasoned, pouring herself a drink.</p>
<p>"So you know it's unwise, but you continue anyway? Do you see indulging these urges in the same emotional vein as charging head-on at Lord Killshade? That you never cared about freeing Zenith, you cared about the thrill of adventure and reaching the apex of your abilities."</p>
<p>"I do still care about helping people. I still step up to the plate when evil rears its ugly head."</p>
<p>"Evil isn't adventurous. Evil doesn't ride into danger, it seeps into the world and grows from the misery. Being the good guy means being at the front of the charge, it also means hearing the call to adventure anywhere, after all the bad guy crosses the street when they hear someone being attacked." Qilue explained.</p>
<p>"So you think I've always had these drives."</p>
<p>"Yes, and they have mixed with your sexual awakening to take on a new and dangerous form. How about you try and find a new adventure to dedicate yourself to? I look forward to hearing about it when you arrive at my office next week. With your clothes on of course."</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>Qilue finished her drink and left Valda's place to head back to her office. As she walked down the street, she undid the top button of her blouse.</p>
<p>Valda walked into Qilue's office with an unsettling grin as Qilue took solace that this time she was fully dressed.</p>
<p>"You seem happy." Qilue prompted.</p>
<p>"Two adventures, one past, one future, all for the good of Zenith." Valda vaingloriously announced before taking a seat. "Turns out owning an inn in Blackbough is the perfect way to lure termites out of the woodwork. Some local crime bosses had been visiting, asking to meet with me to discuss paying protection money, they also weren't happy about my doors being closed to their dream flake dealers. I went in disguise and wasn't intimidated, so they threatened to burn down my Inn and sell me into sex slavery." Qilue smiled, this was a fun adventure that didn't involve the reputational risk of her other recent stories. "So I waited in the tavern and as I expected, they sent some goons round that very night to burn my place down."</p>
<p>"How many survived?" Qilue prompted.</p>
<p>"Only one, the man who told me everything I wanted to know about his organisation and its leader, a man calling himself Shadowfang. I felt like his loose lips would also help send a message not to try this again, not to his bosses, they were already marked for death, but I figured when Shadowfang meets a grizzly fate, someone needed to spread the reason it happened." Valda paused to reflect on what came next.</p>
<p>"So the way he told it, their office was by the docks, but it had a fortified main entrance and a secret tunnel out. If I just charged it, Shadowfang would leave before I got anywhere near him. However the reason they have an office by the docks is that Shadowfang likes to personally inspect any high value deliveries. So I figured if they were so desperate to sell me into sex slavery, I would give them what they wanted." Qilue was so engrossed in the story she forgot to be disapproving of the new direction the story suddenly took.</p>
<p>"I found out when the next shipment of coerced prostitutes was coming in, then I swam out to the boat before it reached the shoreline. I managed to sneak on board and found the compartment where they held the poor things. They were all chained up, naked and scared, so I introduced myself, let them know they were going to be OK, then I found some spare manacles, stripped down and chained myself up alongside them."</p>
<p>"You were wearing your ring of disguise though, right?" Qilue asked.</p>
<p>"Would have given the game away if the slave had on jewelry." Valda replied with a grin. "So they lead us into the dockside offices and line us up in front of some goons and a man matching the description of Shadowfang. I was chained up and they were inspecting my naked body like a piece of meat, I fucking loved it. Then, Shadowfang stands in front of me, stares me up and down, then says, 'fuck me this one looks just like Valda Stormaxe.' Then I replied, 'yeah I get that a lot.' Before bursting out of my chains and snapping his neck. You should have seen it, I did a naked dance of death, killing every slaver in there with nothing but my own strength and skill. I killed one guy by squeezing his head between my thighs. That guy's last experience on the mortal plane was having my vagina pressed against his face with superhuman force."</p>
<p>"Were the captives grateful?" Qilue asked, trying to steer the story away from Valda's vagina.</p>
<p>"Very, after all the thank yous and hugs we found some coverings. I told them to feel free to tell the story of their rescue, but to leave out the bit where it was Valda Stormaxe who was naked and chained. Once they left I hung around their offices a bit longer, just to get a sense of their operations. I borrowed a couple of devices they kept for restraining and punishing more powerful captives, you know, for research purposes."</p>
<p>"Is that the future adventure you mentioned on your way in?" Qilue queried.</p>
<p>"Oh no, although they are a future adventure. No, I got a message from Infernazarr, apparently he found out about some powerful necromancers trying to bring back Lord Killshade, so he's getting the gang together to stop it. It's going to be me, him, Melwyn the rogue, Hortense the Bard, and some new Paladin as the temple of Eldath won't let our old Paladin out to play."</p>
<p>"Sounds exciting."</p>
<p>"Yeah it will be just like old times." Valda mused as she looked out of the window.</p>
<p>Qilue was worried as she expectantly looked at her office door. Valda had been due to arrive ten minutes ago now and had still not shown. She was aware her client had been on an adventure, as well as her penchant for making her own adventures, but if something had gone wrong with either Qilue would have read about it in the papers. On a whim she decided to check out the place Valda rented in Fountainwood.</p>
<p>Qilue walked to the address, vividly remembering the last time she walked this route with Valda naked behind her. Imagining how the walk must look to someone naked searching for cover. She didn't notice that she had undone two of her blouse buttons until she was knocking on the door of Valda's building. The door swung open to a quiet and empty house. Qilue inspected the rooms, they were broadly similar to what she had seen before but something felt different and she couldn't put her finger on what. There was a bolt of inspiration as she checked the bedroom, last time she was here Valda only had one closet, now there were two, one in a logical place, in the corner of the room near a mirror, and one pushed against a spare bit of wall that didn't match the flow of the room.</p>
<p>Qilue opened the out of place closet and immediately found herself faced with a long underground tunnel. The closet was actually a portal door leading to a dungeon. Qilue knew she shouldn't continue inwards, who knows what lay deeper inside? It could be something that Valda the hero could handle, but not something Qilue the therapist was prepared for. She was about to turn away when she heard a muffled scream echoing through the chamber. Throwing all caution to the wind, she dropped to a crouch and began sneaking deeper into the dungeon.</p>
<p>The tunnel opened out into a grand chamber lit by torchlight. In the middle of the chamber was Valda, naked, gagged and strapped to some sort of device, six strength draining glyphs glowing on her sweaty chest. She was on a specially adapted chair, with her arms pulled behind her and strapped together, while her legs were held apart by metal rings around her knees. As she hid and watched, Qilue saw a skeleton enter the chamber, Valda squirmed and gave pleading groans but the skeleton ignored her and placed a glyph on a small metal cylinder, welded into the chair and currently grinding against Valda's pussy.</p>
<p>The moment the glyph made contact with the cylinder, Valda squealed and thrashed as the skeleton walked off through a different door. Qilue took some deep breaths and built up her courage before sprinting out into the clearing. Valda saw her and immediately began grunting into her gag, but Qilue couldn't understand it. Qilue reached the device and began trying to undo the arm binding but it was a series of heavy straps and it was taking a while. Qilue began to become more panicked as she heard the footsteps of a skeleton returning.</p>
<p>A skeleton entered the room and advanced on them menacingly. Qilue screamed with frustration as she undid more buckles and Valda's bulging muscles fought against her bonds. Qilue looked into Valda's eyes with fear as the skeleton grabbed her arm. Valda thrashed and screamed. Then as the skeleton began to drag Qilue away, one of the strength draining Glyphs on Valda's chest faded. The combined effects of Qilue loosening the straps and Valda getting some strength back allowed the hero to break free. She immediately removed her gag and her voice echoed through the dungeon as she yelled.</p>
<p>"All skeletal minions stand down!"</p>
<p>Immediately the skeleton dragging away Qilue dropped her and dissolved into a pile of bones. Qilue collapsed into a scream as Valda untied her legs and unsteadily picked up her therapist and took her back to the house.</p>
<p>"So are you going to explain what the fuck just happened?" Qilue yelled once safely back in the bedroom, forgetting all sense of professionalism.</p>
<p>"It's a long story."</p>
<p>"Well then I'll bill you for an extra hour. What was that?"</p>
<p>"That was the spoils from my latest adventure. A castle built of incredible magic, we have no idea where it physically is, just that the only entrance/exit was a magical door that now resides in my bedroom. I volunteered to hold onto it to check no new bad guys moved in, and Infernazarr found the magic that bound the undead servants to the castle's owner and put them under my command. But that castle, Dr. Mylyl, it was filled with magic and devices all designed to make a captive feel helpless, and as far as I know I'm the only person with access, I thought what better way to privately indulge myself."</p>
<p>"So that was all under your control then?" Qilue seethed.</p>
<p>"I mean I set it up, it wasn't under my control. So those skeletons have no independent thought, you give them instructions and they follow them to the letter. So I strapped myself into that device, the slavers called it the 'malice throne,' and gave one a sack of strength draining glyphs, telling him to apply one to me every time I had less than six active glyphs on me. Then I gave another a mixed sack of glyphs, half shocking grasp, half prestidigitation to invoke vibration, I told him to randomly pick either a shocking grasp glyph or a prestidigitation glyph and apply it to the applicator tube every 5 minutes. The idea was that a third skeleton would be told that if at any point I am not in the contraption before the condition to halt was achieved, he was to take me and strap me into one of the reserve chairs. But then I figured I might as well broaden the command to anyone not strapped into a chair just in case I was interrupted." Valda looked ashamedly at her feet, she had never felt shame on her behalf but putting a bystander at risk shocked her to her core.</p>
<p>"So if you hadn't freed yourself in time, that skeleton would have strapped me into a chair similar to yours?" Qilue yelled, reeling in the memory of what Valda had put herself through and thoughts of her being out in the exact same position.</p>
<p>"Yes I'm sorry, I didn't know you would come here when I missed my session. I told them all to halt when the first skeleton ran out of strength draining glyphs and calculated that the glyphs I gave him would last a couple of hours. Now I think there is a source of glyphs inside this castle, so when they ran out of my supply, they went and got more from somewhere and kept going. By the way, wherever they were getting the glyphs from, they didn't have vibrating prestidigitation, about halfway in it all became shocking grasp" Valda explained rubbing her sore pussy without a hint of modesty.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, how long had you been down there?"</p>
<p>"Well I started about six hours before our session." Valda calmly stated, putting on some clothes from the closet that wasn't a portal to her own personal torture castle.</p>
<p>"So not only were you locked in a torture device for 6 hours, you had no idea how long you were going to be there. What if you had starved to death. Hell what if we had starved to death together in similar chairs. This was exactly what I was talking about when I said if you kept escalating you would put yourself, and others, in danger." Qilue explained, somehow calming herself by falling back into a professional role.</p>
<p>"Alright, I get it. I need some sort of safety net for if this stuff goes wrong." Valda acknowledged.</p>
<p>"Do you have a friend that can be on standby?" Qilue asked.</p>
<p>"Not really. Infernazarr's always judged anyone who isn't high minded like him, can't guarantee Melwyn wouldn't blackmail me, or that I wouldn't hear detailed accounts of my sexual humiliation next time I went to one of Hortense's gigs. I could have trusted our old Paladin Greta, but the temple of Eldath keeps a close eye on her and I don't trust them." Qilue felt sad that Valda didn't have anyone she felt she could trust, then she felt uncomfortable as Valda looked up to her.</p>
<p>"No, no way, I've been unprofessional enough with you as it is. I'm not going to be one of your sex toys as well." Qilue stated.</p>
<p>"Please Dr. Mylyl, think of it as an opportunity to direct my behaviour away from these experiences into more safe and productive things." Qilue scowled. There was no way to justify taking on this additional role under the guise of a therapist, she would be breaking all kinds of guild rules and maybe even some laws. But deep in her mind, Qilue thought about how gripping Valda's adventures seemed, and now she was being offered a chance to share in them, to be right alongside Valda Stormaxe as she risked her dignity and position. Qilue was excited at the position laid out for her, all she had to do was forsake every standard of professionalism she had previously sworn by.</p>
<p>"So, say I take on this role. You would agree that you do not undertake any adventures until you run them by me in advance. I get final say on anything you plan, and you pay me my usual hourly rate for out of office therapy which is steeper than what you're currently paying." Qilue explained.</p>
<p>"Deal." Valda agreed.</p>
<p>"Fine." Qilue sighed. "What sexual predicament did you have planned next?"</p>
<p>Qilue felt profoundly uncomfortable as she ventured further into Blackbough. Valda had assured her that some under the table arrangements had been made to ensure her safe passage, but that didn't make her feel less out of place as night fell on the area of the city, deliberately left to decay, and undesirables started to appear around her. To keep up the ruse of professionalism, Qilue had chosen to wear her work outfit, her white formal suit, this however made her look profoundly out of place among prostitutes and theives.</p>
<p>She reached the address Valda had given her, a moderately sized tavern named 'The Thrusting Rapier' that Valda had acquired purely to fire a handsy manager. There was a small crowd by the front door as Qilue walked into the back and was let in by a large security guard told to expect her arrival. She walked up some stairs and to a private room, reserved for the owner, knocking politely before letting herself in.</p>
<p>As she walked in, she saw Valda in an outfit she could only describe as highly inappropriate. She had only seen similar garments in newspaper pictures on stories about powerful female magical users who clearly wanted their victims to die with a boner. She had a one-piece bikini that looked like someone had tried to make a corset and panties out of lightning, but had to be sparing. Purple zigzags of fabric with gold lining clung to her body and firmed up around her breasts, enough to provide slight support and converge, while still leaving a lot of exposed bosom, while a wickedly high cut leg line drew the eye to a tight crotch framed by the fishnet stockings that ran down her legs to a set of impractical gold heels.</p>
<p>"How do I look?" Valda asked, throwing a long flowing cape over her shoulders.</p>
<p>"Like a stripper." Qilue honestly replied.</p>
<p>"Good, that's kind of what I'm going for." Valda quipped. She handed Qilue a small pouch that jingled with the sound of loose metal inside. "You want to pick for me?"</p>
<p>Qilue could not believe how calm Valda was considering her plan. When she had taken over The Thrusting Rapier, one event she couldn't get rid of without risking a riot from her customers, was the weekly strip show. Every week the tavern was packed to the rafters while a variety of performer's came from far and wide to show a lot of flesh in every skin-tone imaginable. Valda had decided she wanted to perform as well, but had also decided to add a little bit of risk to the process. In Qilue's hand was a pouch with 10 rings in it, 9 of the rings were a ring of disguise, 1 was an identical ring without any magic on it. Valda had resolved to wear a mask until she was right by the entrance to the performance area of the tavern, then just before she stepped out she would put on the ring and take off the mask. She would then do her full strip routine, not knowing if everyone thought she was just another stripper, or if everyone would lose their minds watching Valda Stormaxe strip for them.</p>
<p>Qilue rummaged around and picked out a ring that she handed to Valda. Valda grinned, put on her mask and headed out of the door.</p>
<p>"You sure you don't want to come and watch? My strip routine lasts a while and I was going to chat with my fellow performers afterwards so I may take some time."</p>
<p>"I will be up here for an hour, then I will come and get you and bring you back here. That is the deal." Qilue insisted pointing at the hourglass she had bought for the purpose.</p>
<p>"Suit yourself" Valda joked, putting on her mask and heading towards the noise of the crowd.</p>
<p>The moment the door shut behind her, Qilue immediately stood in front of the mirror and began testing the remaining rings one at a time to secretly confirm that Valda was safe. The fourth ring she tried had no effect on her appearance and she sighed with relief that she wouldn't have to figure out how to stop Valda from exposing herself. Now content to listen to the cheers of the crowd and imagine Valda disgracing herself in front of them, Qilue relaxed and sat down. Glancing around the room she saw evidence of how much Valda had planned this, there were several different sets of makeup, even though the rings provided makeup as part of the disguise. There were also several outfits Valda had clearly circled through, all of them as scandalous as the one she had just worn into the tavern.</p>
<p>Qilue thumbed through the outfits, wondering what must have been going through Valda's mind as she picked out the outfit to embarrass herself in. She grabbed one outfit, a red and gold corset with an attached skirt that draped around the back but cut off halfway around the waist. Whoever wore this would have the front of their legs on display all the way up to the hip, with the only fabric between their pussy and the world being a thin strip that dangled down from the base of the corset at the front. Idly she held it in front of herself as she stood in front of the mirror.</p>
<p>Then she had an idea. A terrible idea. An unprofessional, embarrassing, unthinkable idea. She checked the hourglass she was using to gauge when she had to go fetch Valda; it still had so much sand in the upper chamber, she would have privacy for so much time, and she was curious to feel how Valda must feel every time she set herself up for one of these adventures. Qilue took a deep breath and began to strip off her professional clothes.</p>
<p>As Qilue stared at herself in the mirror, it became clear that this outfit was too big for her and it was still incredibly inappropriate. She had used some nearby pins to pin up the skirt fabric, halving its length and keeping it from trailing in the floor. She had also pulled the corset as tight as it could go and it still felt a little loose. But as she looked in the mirror, she saw herself in a way she had never seen herself before. Her dark grey skin framed by explosions of gold and red, her intimates teased with every sway of the skirt fabric, her bust more covered than she would have liked, but still pushed up into lascivious cleavage.</p>
<p>She swayed in front of the mirror, squealing a bit every time she swayed a bit much and caught a flash of brilliant white pubic hair, or in the worst cases, a glimpse of her pussy. She leered and posed to see herself reduced to a sex object, running her hands up and down her body. As an experiment she picked up one of the rings of disguise and put it on. Suddenly she was looking at a buxom redhead in the mirror, her thick makeup making every smile deeply salacious. As Qilue watched this alter ego dance in the mirror she caught herself whispering to herself and was shocked at what she was saying.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"I could do it. I could join Valda on stage. I could be a stripper as well..." Qilue went into a fugue state as she walked towards the door, her hand was on the handle when she came back to her senses. "No I can't, I can't, I can't." She repeated to herself as she retreated back to the room and quickly changed into her professional clothes. She sat confused and worried at herself until Valda returned.</p>
<p>"See, you didn't have to come get me, I returned. Everything went to plan." She reassured as she entered the room naked carrying a pile of fabric scraps that used to be her outfit.</p>
<p>"That's good to hear." Qilue replied, blankly staring at the wall.</p>
<p>"Are you OK, Dr. Mylyl..."</p>
<p>"All fine, gotta go, see you at our next session." Qilue blurted out as she practically sprinted out of the door.</p>
<p>"And how are you doing with Valda Stormaxe's therapy?" Asked Qilue's supervisor, looking over his glasses at her.</p>
<p>"Oh OK, normal, just... you know, doing therapy." Qilue uneasily responded.</p>
<p>Qilue paced her office, eagerly awaiting her favourite client. Valda strolled in and the pleasantries were barely over when they began to plan her next adventure.</p>
<p>"So what do you have planned this time?" Qilue asked, barely containing her excitement.</p>
<p>"I want to try something I've wanted to do for a while now, I want you to shackle me inside a crate and have me delivered across town." Valda explained.</p>
<p>"Alright, details. Where would you want the crate to be picked up? Where would you want the crate delivered? And what state will you be in inside the crate?" Qilue asked clinically.</p>
<p>"So I was thinking from my apartment in Fountainwood to the tavern in Blackbough. It can be marked as a same day business delivery so I don't have to spend a night in a depot somewhere. As for the state I am in, the slavers had some portable restraint straps, it's like an outfit made of leather straps that has cuffs for my arms and legs to hold me in a kneeling position with my hands behind my back. A few strength draining glyphs and I would be helpless."</p>
<p>"Crate would have to be pretty snug for you not to bounce around." Qilue observed.</p>
<p>"I already have a crate in mind, it's an old industrial size tea chest that I fit very snugly in. It also has a prominent 'this way up' sign to keep me from being stored upside down."</p>
<p>"If those straps are forcing you to kneel, surely you could attach some form of dildo to the bottom of the box to churn inside you as the box is manhandled?" Qilue suggested.</p>
<p>"Good suggestion, I see someone's starting to enjoy these adventures. I'll make a pervert out of you yet."</p>
<p>"Uh, no... I was just trying to be empathetic... I would never..." Qilue blustered as she blushed all over.</p>
<p>"But you're right, I can build things into the crate. What about some labia clips either side of the dildo, and some nipple clips to stretch out my breasts with every bump in the road." Valda brainstormed.</p>
<p>"These adventures of yours always come with an element of risk. Have you thought about the risks of this adventure?" Qilue asked, trying to maintain a veneer of professionalism.</p>
<p>"Well there's always a risk the box could get damaged or broken, they could hear my moans and look inside, or I get delivered to the wrong address." Valda thought aloud, clearly getting worked up over the possibilities. "But you'll seal the crate, it's pretty thick which means it will be sturdy and quite soundproof, and I trust you to write the correct address, specifying the trade entrance to the Thrusting Rapier so I don't end up opened in-front of all my customers."</p>
<p>"In which case, I think we should head over to yours to prepare."</p>
<p>Qilue couldn't believe the state Valda was in as the skeletons shuffled her trussed up body into the tea chest, the front panel was currently removed to help maneuver the horny hero. Valda moaned as they shuffled her into the box and she squirmed so the dildo could slowly work its way into her. Qilue tingled at the thought of what came next. She reached into the box and grabbed a hold of the clips on either side of the dildo, one at a time attaching them to Valda's labia, locking her pussy in position.</p>
<p>Next the skeletons brought in the front panel of the tea chest and began nailing it into place. As they did so, Qilue reached into the box, grappling with the clips built into the front panel to attach them to Valda nipples as the hero moaned in painful ecstasy.</p>
<p>"Alright, now I'm in, I've made a decision, could you go to the table and grab a glyph I left next to your notebook?" Valda asked, confusing Qilue.</p>
<p>"Sure, what kind of glyph is it?" Qilue replied as she picked up the magic sign.</p>
<p>"Constitution drain. I want this to hurt more than it currently does." Valda casually explained.</p>
<p>"It doesn't hurt now, but the pain of clips will build up over time."</p>
<p>"And over time the constitution drain glyph will wear off." Qilue considered the logic and decided a single glyph shouldn't be too bad, opting to slap it onto Valda's breast with a bit of force, Valda moaning as her battle hardened nerves softened with the magic coursing through her. "Alright let's do this."</p>
<p>"Skeleton minions, nail the lid on the crate then drag it in front of the house. Then return to the castle through the door in the bedroom." Qilue ordered. She oversaw the package being prepared for pickup and then sat waiting next to it in the street, the last thing she needed was someone stealing it. Eventually a couple of orcs in courier uniforms approached her to sign for pickup.</p>
<p>"How long do you think it's going to take?" Qilue asked, desperately trying to contain her nerves.</p>
<p>"We don't have many other deliveries today, so we should be in Blackbough pretty sharpish." The bigger orc replied.</p>
<p>"But you do have other deliveries? It's just that I plan on unloading at the other end so I'll need some time to get there."</p>
<p>"Alright, I'll tell you what, we move pretty fast, and Blackbough is a terrible place to find food. So how about we stop for lunch before we get to yours? Make sure you have time to get there and get everything ready." The larger orc suggested.</p>
<p>"Sounds great." Qilue replied, thinking stretching Valda's adventure a little longer would probably be appreciated. She watched with awkward pleasantness as the orcs clumsily manhandled the box into their cart and set off down the road. Qilue then made her own way to the Thrusting Rapier, as fast as her legs could carry her.</p>
<p>Once at the tavern, Qilue sequestered herself in the back office bedroom she had spent time in while Valda was stripping for the crowds. She figured with a circuitous route and a lunch break she had plenty of time to rummage through Valda's things, just to see what she had around.</p>
<p>In Valda's closet, Qilue found a variety of unacceptable outfits, and felt a pang of sadness that they were all made for someone with a much larger frame. Then she spotted a metal case at the bottom of the wardrobe, looking inside she found a collection of sexual tools, a bag of rings of disguise, and a pile of glyphs. Qilue found herself feeling warm at the sight of chains, clamps, cuffs, dildos, and plugs the likes of which she had never seen. She then found a two piece loincloth inside that shimmered with magical energy.</p>
<p>Qilue inspected the loincloth, this was the loincloth of legend, the one Valda was wearing in all the statues, as she took the pieces in her hands, she felt it shrink until it was the right size for her to wear, a feature common in high level magical items, and from there she knew she had to try it on.</p>
<p>Qilue left her clothes in a clumsy pile on the bed as she stood naked in front of the mirror sizing up the loincloth. She started by looping the rough thread of the top over her head, although it looked a bit like a bra, as she was putting it on Qilue realised it was effectively a string scaffolding with which two patches of leather could drape over her breasts, surprisingly this still offered her support through some enchantment corsing through it. When she first started putting it on, the roughness of the leather against her nipples grated at her, but as the buffs activated the constitution boost made the rough leather feel comfortable, like an extension of her own skin. Next she took the loincloth bottoms and inspected how they were supposed to go on.</p>
<p>Qilue marvelled at how Valda could go adventuring in this, she even speculated that the flimsiness of the outfit might have helped with her association of exposure and adventure, as the loincloth bottoms were little more than a string belt with modesty flaps of studded leather at the front and back. As she tied it around her waist she felt her muscles firm up and tighten.</p>
<p>She looked at herself in the mirror and marvelled at the effect. Her body looked more toned and muscular, while the grey leather swayed alluringly with every movement. She inspected herself at every angle, imagining it was her body on plinths and pedestals around town. However, unlike the dress she had previously tried on, no matter how much she swayed, even when she did a handstand, the flaps of leather somehow always stayed covering her breasts and privates, some enchantment holding them in a position to prevent their wearer's exposure.</p>
<p>Qilue walked the room, she rummaged through the closet to take a closer look at Valda's other outfits, spending a good amount of time staring at the one Valda wore when she became a stripper for the night. As she stared and mused she caught a glimpse of purple in the mirror. As she turned she saw that it now looked like she was wearing an identical outfit, only perfectly fitting her body.</p>
<p>"Valda you smart cookie. You had some wizard put a glamour on your loincloth so you could still wear it in town and not look underdressed." She reasoned. One by one Qilue used the glamour loincloth to see how every one of Valda's stripper outfits looked on her. Each and every outfit driving up Qilue's confidence and sex drive. She tried on one outfit, then as an experiment she closed her eyes and with great effort imagined that outfit, only with holes cut in the bust points so her nipples could be seen. When she opened her eyes again, the outfit had adjusted itself to her whims and she giggled at the sight of her exposed nipples.</p>
<p>Driven wild by her own experimentation, Qilue decided that this was too good an opportunity to pass up, she wanted to use this loincloth to have a little adventure of her own. She was going to try out the sort of thing Valda had been discovering, so sitting in Valda's bedroom she began to scheme.</p>
<p>The orcs had taken their time with their lunch, and had now arrived at their last delivery of the day. They pulled the cart around the back of the tavern where the trades entrance was and knocked on the door.</p>
<p>The door swung open and the woman behind it stunned the orcs for a moment. She was a redheaded girl, heavy on the makeup and freckles across her body. She stood unashamed wearing a black lace bodystocking with crotch and breast cutouts. Two heart shaped pasties covered her nipples and a small red thong was all that stood for her modesty as she looked the orcs up and down.</p>
<p>"Can I help you?" She asked with contempt. The orcs stared in silence for a moment longer than was comfortable. "Hey, if you're looking for a free show I'm going to call security, you pay the entrance fee tonight like everyone else."</p>
<p>"Sorry, no." The orc babbled. "We have a delivery for Qilue." He showed the stripper the forms and she rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Fine I'll just go and get her. Wait here." The stripper turned and the orcs watched as her barely covered bottom shimmied down the hall and up the stairs. A few moments later Qilue was there to sign the parcel, looking surprisingly out of breath.</p>
<p>Qilue got the orcs to drop off Valda's crate in her room, then once they left she opened it with a crowbar. As she got off the lid, she found a sweaty ravenous beast inside. Valda screamed with each clip removed, and once free she encouraged Qilue to leave, she wanted to 'fuck my fingers till my clit falls off.'</p>
<p>Qilue was happy to oblige as she had similar plans.</p>
<p>"I'm going to do it!" Valda announced as she stormed into Qilue's office. "It's been a while seeing as how bad last time went, but I'm going to apply some strength draining glyphs and get fucked properly this time." She had been stewing on this idea for a while and felt if she said it to Qilue then she would have to go through with it.</p>
<p>"Confronting past traumatic events can be positive if done in the right way. How do you plan to do this?"</p>
<p>"Well it's going to be prostitution again, however this time it's going to be me being the prostitute. So it's common among the strip night customers at the Thrusting Rapier to ask strippers what their price is to sleep with them. Last time I stripped I got several offers, so I figured I would strip again this week, and this time I would take someone up on the offer."</p>
<p>"Being a prostitute is a dangerous profession, if you weaken yourself there's nothing to stop you becoming victim to a variety of unpleasant crimes sex workers face." Qilue reasoned, trying to make things safer.</p>
<p>"Which is why I'll have a glyph of dispel. If anyone tries anything, I'll cancel all spells and be my usual unstoppable self."</p>
<p>"A glyph of dispel would also remove the effects of the ring of disguise." Qilue observed.</p>
<p>"Trust me, if someone is acting in a way that I have to remove the glyphs, they aren't living to tell people what they saw." Valda confidently asserted. Qilue agreed with the plan and her mind raced with a plan of her own.</p>
<p>The roar of the crowd in the tavern once again permeated the building as Qilue watched Valda get ready. She saw Valda's stoney determination so didn't interrupt with small talk as she tightened a floral corset with lace trim and detachable bust cups. As she bent over to pull up her knickers, a tight translucent black pair with frilly ruffles, she noticed Qilue's bag.</p>
<p>"What's in the bag?" Valda asked.</p>
<p>"Books, I was waiting a while last time so I thought I'd bring some things to keep me entertained while you went to whore yourself out." Qilue replied.</p>
<p>"Fair enough," Valda shrugged as she began to rummage through her rings of disguise, eventually settling on a ditsy looking blonde.</p>
<p>"Alright, wish me luck." Valda announced, as she strolled out of the door. As the door closed behind her, Qilue counted to ten and then sprang into action with her own plan. She opened up her bag and giggled at the outfit she had managed to get made in time for today, her very own stripper outfit.</p>
<p>Qilue stripped down, then began to assemble the ridiculous set of items. It started with a purple bejeweled collar that fit snugly around her neck and a matching garter belt around her hips. At the front of the collar was a hook which Qilue used to hook two strips of fabric, each running diagonally from the centre of her neck, over her breasts, then round to the back where they clipped on to the back of the garter belt. With some adjustment they pulled tight against her breasts, offering the illusion of support and only the slightest possibility they wouldn't pop out. She then put on a purple tie side thong, pulling it tight against her pussy. Once satisfied with the amount of camel toe on show, she pulled her stockings up her legs and clipped them to the garter belt, being careful not to accidentally untie her thong ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Qilue stared at herself in the mirror as she put on the ring of disguise and watched her dark grey skin and silver hair get replaced with a freckled white complexion and wild ginger locks.</p>
<p>"This outfit suited me better without the disguise." She thought to herself. The exotic purple clashed with the red hair and didn't seem to fit with the rustic homeliness of pale freckles. She spent some time putting the ring on and taking it off, watching herself in the mirror, trying to talk herself out of the terrible decision her mind wanted her to make.</p>
<p>"Nobody in Blackbough actually knows who you are." She said to herself, beginning to pace. "It's not like any of your friends or family would happen to be visiting a tavern in Blackbough."</p>
<p>"But what if Valda sees?"</p>
<p>"She's planning on going to some stranger's house to fuck him, you would have plenty of time while she's gone."</p>
<p>"Word could get back to her."</p>
<p>"You think she wants feedback on every stripper in her establishment. Worst case scenario someone mentions a half-drow stripper and she pauses for a moment before shaking off the idea. There are loads of half-drow in Zenith."</p>
<p>In the end, Qilue decided to throw on a big cloak with a hood to cover herself, with the ring in the pocket. She decided to make the call when she had a chance to scope out the tavern and see what she was dealing with. She picked up her shoes and slipped them on, delighting that her day to day heels were high enough to fit the part, every day after today she would bring a little of her performance with her. Her hand shook as she turned the knob and uneasily walked towards the roar of the crowd.</p>
<p>She peered into the keg room, which had been repurposed as a changing room where several strippers were either getting ready or packing up. Valda was not there, so Qilue reasoned she must be on the floor already. Qilue streadied her nerves as best she could as she walked through the keg room and peered out into the tavern. Nobody paid her any heed.</p>
<p>The strip night at the Thrusting Rapier was incredibly anarchic. Strippers would grab a mug on their way out, then they would scout out any table that looked open and willing to have them. When it became clear it would be worth their time, they would climb onto the table, place their mug at their feet, and begin their show as the tips rolled in.</p>
<p>On the doorway out there was also a chart demonstrating their sophisticated system of flowers on tables. A blue flower meant they wanted a male presenting stripper, pink a female, yellow it didn't matter. If they had a red flower they wanted humans only, but a purple flower meant they were interested in more exotic races. The yelling and haggling happening over the sensuous chamber music showed the flowers were an opening statement for horse trading between the tables, with plenty of security on hand to make sure nobody got out of line. To reinforce this there were posters all around the tavern that simply read 'everyone has the right to say no.'</p>
<p>Valda was in the far corner, dancing for a gaggle of dwarves, she had already removed her breast cups, converting the corset to a waist corset and freeing her tits in the process. Qilue spotted her just in time to see her drop her knickers in the beard of a high paying dwarf and adjust her dance to give the whole party a view of her pussy.</p>
<p>The dwarf beckoned Valda down to his level and whispered something in her ear. Valda nodded and climbed down from the table, taking the dwarfs hand and walking with him out of the bar. Qilue figured that the dwarf was about to get lucky, which meant now was the time for her to go through with her plan. She took off her cloak and placed it on a coat hook, leaving the ring of disguise in the pocket as she strutted out into the tavern.</p>
<p>As she looked around, eyes started turning to her. People were examining her body, looking at her with unhidden lust, she swooned a little at the attention she was getting but managed to steady herself by gripping her tip mug.</p>
<p>"Hey, half-drow. We haven't seen you here before." A blonde boisterous man yelled. She turned her head to see a table of adventurers, the telltale diversity of races and body types as much a giveaway as the armer and scabbards.</p>
<p>"Haven't been here before." Qilue coquettishly replied, eyeing up the table and seeing a yellow and purple flower.</p>
<p>"Oh in which case we must be the ones to take your virginity." The man yelled, gesturing her over. Qilue stayed rooted to the spot for a moment and quickly caught herself.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>"You have a big coin pouch to match that big mouth of yours?" Qilue replied by way of explanation as to why she was hesitant. His table erupted into cheers and a high elf in a strange magical robe put a large pouch on the table just in response to her talking back to their bard.</p>
<p>Qilue awkwardly climbed onto the table and stood up. The view standing on the table transformed the tavern, it was like floating in a separate realm just for those who debased themselves for the cheering mob below. It also gave her a perfect view of all the eyes that turned towards her and she began to sway to the music. She started to gyrate and run her hands over her body, the small tables not allowing for much movement. She slowly rotated around, drinking in the lustful stares of the tavern, squealing as a clink in her tip cup often heralded a stray hand running up her leg. She had barely started when she couldn't take it any more and unclipped the fabric from garter belt, then from her collar so she could watch it flutter to the floor and reveal her breasts to the cheering tavern.</p>
<p>The adventuring party were courteous enough to take her clothes and tuck them under the tip mug for safekeeping as Qilue thrust her breasts out, showing off her stiff excited nipples and drinking in the roar of the crowd, the boisterous bard leading the nearby cheers. The bard made a show of placing a gold piece in Qilue's tip cup, so she smiled and had an idea. She squatted at the side of the table, thrusting her hips over the edge between the Bard and the high elf.</p>
<p>"Each of you take a string of my thong in your mouth." She instructed. She felt clumsy lips kissing at her hips, then in a single movement, she straightened up, so the thong came untied and was left behind in the two customers' mouths as she continued to dance.</p>
<p>'They can see my tits and pussy' she thought to herself, her panic not stopping her dance. They can see everything. They are cheering my slutty tits and wet whore pussy.' Her hands started to linger more and more between her thighs as she ran them over her body. At one point she went prostrated herself on the table and could have sworn a small crowd briefly formed behind her.</p>
<p>She stood up and began to think how she could bring the dance to an end. She knew she might soon get offered sex for money, and as much as the idea intrigued her, she wanted to be alone with this memory. As she twirled on the table, she caught something out of the corner of her eye that froze her blood. A dwarf returning to his table, arm in arm with a post-coital Valda, who was staring directly at Qilue with a grin that was simultaneously surprised, excited, and more smug than any smile that had ever been plastered across a human face.</p>
<p>"Shit" Qilue said to herself for the hundred and forty fifth time since she made her excuses and retreated from the tavern as fast as she could. She was now trying her hardest to quickly redress in the back room of the tavern before her client returned, a mission she failed in as Valda burst through the door. "Shit!"</p>
<p>"Woah, Dr. Mylyl. I knew you were getting interested in the things I do but I never thought you would start copying me." Valda announced through her laughter.</p>
<p>"I thought you were going back to the dwarf's house to have sex with him."</p>
<p>"It was a quickie in the alleyway next to the tavern, but don't change the subject, Dr. Mylyl the stripper."</p>
<p>"What you saw tonight was a huge lapse in professional and personal judgement. Salvaging a productive relationship from this is going to be a nigh on impossible task." Qilue ranted as she searched around for her clothes. Valda spotted where she had left them first and managed to lunge over a table and grabbed them. "Valda, give me back my clothes."</p>
<p>"I want you to stay and talk about this." Valda pleaded. Qilue made a lunge for her, but as she did Valda slapped the rune of dispel on herself and Qilue seemed to simply bounce off her.</p>
<p>"So that's what it has come to? You're going to bully me."</p>
<p>"Remember that time you overpowered me to make a point? Well now I'm doing the same." Valda explained.</p>
<p>"That would be a legitimate argument if our relationship was symmetrical. We are not friends, we are not co-workers, I am your therapist and you are my client."</p>
<p>"Maybe that was true before today. But I think we can agree that bridge is burned and you're the one holding the torch."</p>
<p>"Relationships aren't like a bridge, they are like a series of roads with well placed barriers, making sure we intersect in the right places, and keeping one person's disasters from harming the other. You have been systematically removing the reinforcements from those barriers and today my horse and cart careened off the road and through the gaps you made." Qilue explained.</p>
<p>"So where do we go from here?" Valda asked as Qilue collapsed into a chair.</p>
<p>"There are no good ways forward. I can't continue to be your therapist. I hadn't been healthy for you for a long time but tonight was the final rubicon. The correct thing to do would be to refer you to a new therapist, but when the question of why I did that arises, my answer directs your next therapist so it would damage your treatment for me to tell anything truth. So I tell the truth and the guild suspends my license and before you know it tonight's misstep becomes my only source of income."</p>
<p>"So let's just continue what we've been doing." Valda suggested.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah that's working out great." Qilue sarcastically sobbed. "I'm looking forward to my supervision, 'how's the most high profile client that has ever sought therapy?' 'Great, last week she sold her body like a common whore.' 'that sounds like things have gotten much worse since she started seeing you.' 'Well that's because I've given it tacit endorsement every step of the way.'"</p>
<p>"It's not that bad..." Valda tried to interrupt Qilue's unhinged performance.</p>
<p>"No wait, here comes the best bit. 'So how are you planning to dissuade her from this self-destructive behaviour?' 'Well I figured the best thing to do was to cede any sense of professionalism by letting her see me showing off my naked body to a bunch of strangers for fun, thus ensuring that any advice I gave for her to curb these desires could be dismissed as hypocrisy.'"</p>
<p>"Qilue!" Valda boomed, standing up and silencing Qilue with practiced intimidation. "Listen to me carefully. Even now, even with everything going on, the idea of doing wrong by me is completely beyond you. You care about my wellbeing but seem to think that the only way to cater to that is to follow the rules and guidelines. You see your bending of the rules as lapses in your morality, but I see it as the evolution of your belief system. So now that your morals have reached their ultimate test, I will tell you what I plan to do and you can choose how you react. You are a good person Qilue, so I will do what all heroes do, I will protect good people. If you choose to refer me to a new therapist, I will tell them that I once dragged you into my perverted games and you immediately dropped me. I will lie my ass off to make sure all you have to do is nod along to keep your career secure. However, if you want to keep up our association, one that moves beyond the traditional role of a therapist and a patient, I will continue to engage however you see things panning out with these new developments. I want to continue down this road with you, but it's not my choice."</p>
<p>Valda dropped Qilue's clothes at her feet, then walked out of the door to leave Qilue with her thoughts.</p>
<p>Valda spent the week awaiting some sort of message or visit from Qilue, everyday was met with the total silence of uninterrupted routine, but Valda knew it couldn't continue forever, there was a scheduled therapy appointment in her diary that she was determined to keep. Valda approached the office, enthusiastic to see which way Qilue had decided, making peace with the possibility of the severing of the relationship as at least it would put her out of the agonising uncertainty of the past week. She knocked on the door and uncertainly shuffled in.</p>
<p>"Ah, Valda. You're right on time, please sit down so we can begin our session." Qilue calmly stated. Valda stood in shock as Qilue's calm demeanor seemed at odds with her total nudity. She was sat in her regular seat, clipboard ready to write notes, everything totally ordinary except for the absence of any clothes. Valda watched the telltale rapid rise and fall of her breasts, betraying the calm demeanor she was affecting and smirked as she sat on the couch.</p>
<p>"So as you can probably deduce from my appearance, I have decided that our relationship should continue and evolve in light of recent revelations." Qilue explained, squirming with the unfamiliar feeling of her bare bottom on the fabric of her chair.</p>
<p>"I can see that. What would you have said if someone else walked through that door?"</p>
<p>"Oh my god, could you imagine?" Qilue replied, dropping her professional demeanor and falling into a fit of giggles. "Some other client is in the area, decides to drop in to rearrange their appointment and sees me like this." Valda laughed heartily, cutting the tension in the room.</p>
<p>"So what happens next?" Valda awkwardly asked.</p>
<p>"Well I'm still going to check in on your mental health, make sure you don't follow this dark path to a destination you don't want to go. But aside from that I figured we could continue with our arrangement, with the proviso that I no longer need to be entirely excluded from your adventures." Qilue explained.</p>
<p>"Alright I'll agree to that, but on one condition." Valda replied, pulling a ring of disguise out of her pocket.</p>
<p>Valda waved her hand above her head, signalling that the way was clear as Qilue broke cover and ran down the alleyway. Qilue marvelled at how everything on the road she travelled everyday seemed different when combined with the rush of being naked and exposed. Every cart, doorway and wall that would usually form the backdrop of some humdrum journey was now studied and retained as a vital hiding spot in the case of a sudden need to flee. She had mixed feelings about looking down at her pale naked skin, happy for the disguise but wishing she had her natural darker skin to help fade into the shadows better.</p>
<p>She remembered the confidence of being in Valda's position, walking ahead without a concern, then giving a short wave as the exposed degenerate caught up, the quiet slapping of her bare feet on cobblestones echoing in her ears with every step. She was surprised at how oblivious passersby were, the schema people fell into as they continued about their uneventful moments, she wondered if in the past she'd carried on a meaningless conversation, connecting the dots between various points of standard small talk, while a deviant lurked naked behind a cart hoping to remain undetected.</p>
<p>Every time she was forced to hide and wait, Qilue felt her hands stroking her body, reading each goosebump like a braille story of her humiliation, occasionally just toying with her pussy and feeling her hand become moist.</p>
<p>She squealed at the thought of what came next, Fountainwood high street, the road that was perpetually busy, that Valda didn't even try to cross without being seen. She hid behind the same doorway that she remembered Valda hiding behind and waited as her guide scouted ahead.</p>
<p>As soon as Valda stepped into the street, it seemed like a crowd had formed around her to meet and greet the hero of Zenith. Far from clearing the thoroughfare, Valda was actually attracting more people. Qilue hopped with frustration as Valda began to shake hands and greet passers-by, her mind whirring trying to think of how to respond to the growing potential audience. Then all of a sudden, the door whose alcove she had chosen to hide in opened.</p>
<p>Qilue stared at the well-to-do halfling couple as they left their home. The halfling couple stared at the naked stranger hiding in their doorway. The stalemate of shock was broken by the halfling wife screaming at the top of her lungs, forcing Qilue to instinctively start running into the thoroughfare.</p>
<p>As Qilue felt her body warmed by the unimpeded sun, her gaze was drawn to the crowd gathered around Valda, all heads turned towards the sound of screams, all eyes on the naked woman who had just sprinted out of the dark alleyway.</p>
<p>"Everybody stay where you are, this individual could be cursed, let me deal with it." Valda cried as she shimmied through the crowd towards Qilue, who was desperately running as fast as she could with one arm over her bouncing breasts, one hand over her streaming pussy, and her eyes full of tears. She reached the alleyway on the other side and simply kept running, startling a homeless man and a gnomish merchant as she streaked past them.</p>
<p>Qilue made it to Valda's house and immediately started yanking at the doorknob in vain, shuddering at the thought of being locked out in her current state. Luckily enough Valda was right behind and was able to do the required movements to open the secret locks and let Qilue jump into the house to safety.</p>
<p>"There you go, what do you think?" Valda quipped as Qilue collapsed through the door. She saw the ravenous but frustrated look in Qilue's eyes and knew what she wanted to do now. "Oh I get it, you're still not comfortable masturbating in front of me, that's fine. I'll go do my daily patrol of the castle, you go ahead and swim in that memory for a bit."</p>
<p>By the time Valda returned, Qilue had redressed and returned to her business demeanor, her tousled hair the only indication of the deviancy she had just been engaging in.</p>
<p>"So Valda, tell me about your parents."</p>
<p>Despite everything Qilue was eager to keep their time together focused on Valda, partly to justify a residual feeling that she was helping the deviant hero, partly because she was seduced into her actions by the tales of Valda's adventures that she wanted to be a part of. However Valda was still giddy that someone else was starting to show the same perversions as her and wanted Qilue in on the adventures as much as possible. Eventually they would strike a compromise that they would still plan adventures for Valda with Qilue adjusting to tamp down the most risky and damaging angles. The new difference was that if Qilue wanted Valda to do something to make it less risky, she would have to do something risky in return.</p>
<p>"Alright, so here's my new plan." Valda announced as Qilue sat with her notepad. "I want to do something with the castle skeletons again, and now I have a friend on hand to help if something goes wrong I can make it more risky." Valda and Qilue both felt a wave of goosebumps was over their bodies at the prospects ahead.</p>
<p>"So my main plan is to be captured by skeletons, and punished for any resistance while you watch on and cancel the skeletal orders if things get out of hand." Valda explained.</p>
<p>"Were you ever held captive during your adventuring days?" Qilue asked to keep focus on introspection.</p>
<p>"It's kind of your bread and butter when you're still honing your skills. But I always either broke out or was rescued before anything too bad would happen. Do here's my plan, naturally I would start with my strength drained by the glyphs, totally naked, and with my hands tied behind my back. I will then have one skeleton whose job it is to lead me around by a leash, every time he reaches a branch in the path, he randomly decides which direction to take. If he reaches a dead end he goes back, this way I will be dragged around a castle I still haven't fully explored. Plus the best part, I will leave the closet door open so there is always a chance they could drag me back to Fountainwood and have me walking the streets." Qilue was already beginning to get uncomfortable with the possibilities.</p>
<p>"Now I am to be a compliant prisoner or I will be punished, and there happens to be a good way to measure that. Infernazarr told me that I can set up triggers for any time a skeleton takes damage, he assumed it would be useful to send one for help if anyone attacked the castle. So I'm going to use glyphs to weaken the hand of the skeleton holding my leash, if at any point I pull on the leash to hard, one of his fingers will snap, when that happens another skeleton will apply a healing glyph to their hand, then apply a random glyph to me from a bag I prepared."</p>
<p>"I see, of course I will want to see which glyphs you chose. I am also curious as to what decides when the adventure ends." Qilue asked, getting more excited as she thought through all the ways this could go wrong.</p>
<p>"The adventure ends when the strength draining glyphs wear off, about an hour after application, and I am able to affect my own escape." Valda explained. "As for the glyphs, here's the list I will be procuring from my Glyph trader."</p>
<p>Qilue's eyes widened at the list put in front of her, it was an insanely unthinkable set of spells, with the occasional additional instruction scrawled alongside them for guiding the skeleton.</p>
<p>1: Blindness (30 mins).</p>
<p>2: Deafness. (30 mins).</p>
<p>3: Prestidigitation: vibration (5 mins): applied to the clitoris.</p>
<p>4: Shocking grasp: applied to the nipples.</p>
<p>5: Shocking grasp: applied to the clitoris.</p>
<p>6: Frostbite: applied to the nipples.</p>
<p>7: Frostbite: applied to the clitoris.</p>
<p>8: Thorn whip (4 whips): targets the tits.</p>
<p>9: Thorn whip (4 whips): targets the bottom.</p>
<p>10: Cause fear (5 mins).</p>
<p>11: Prestidigitation: move leash clip from collar to nipples.</p>
<p>12: Prestidigitation: move leash clip from nipples to clitoris. If clip not on nipples return glyph to bag and pick another.</p>
<p>13: Command: beg (2 mins).</p>
<p>14: Minor illusion : subject looks like they are dripping in cum (30 mins).</p>
<p>15: Thaumaturgy: triple the volume of all sounds made by target (15 mins).</p>
<p>16: Infestation.</p>
<p>17: Command: piss (2 mins).</p>
<p>18: Command: orgasm (2 mins).</p>
<p>19: Minor illusion: the words "Valda Stormaxe is a whore" appear in large letters above. (15 mins.</p>
<p>20: Glyph of empowerment (1 hour), all new or active glyphs either double in length or increase intensity.</p>
<p>"That's certainly adventurous." Qilue admitted, reading and rereading the list. "Given how big the castle is, do you think it likely that you're going to end up going back through the portal and find yourself on a public street in Zenith?"</p>
<p>"It's possible but unlikely."</p>
<p>"Just to be on the safe side, maybe you should wear your ring of disguise." Qilue suggested, knowing that she would have to give something up to obtain that.</p>
<p>"Alright, I'll put on the ring of disguise on two conditions. Number one, we change the 19th glyph to a glyph that dispels any disguise spells. And two you are not allowed to wear clothes until my adventure is over."</p>
<p>"Those seem reasonable, I agree. Next, you realise the glyph of empowerment will also empower the strength draining glyphs, extending your adventure?"</p>
<p>"I'm counting on it."</p>
<p>"Very well, in which case, to prevent a repeat of the last time you had an adventure with skeletons, I would recommend having the adventure automatically end after a certain period of time." Qilue pitched, eagerly awaiting the price of her concern.</p>
<p>"Well I was thinking you could order the skeletons to disengage when you felt appropriate, However in exchange for that, the skeletons will respond to your first order to disengage by applying a glyph to you, only after the second order will they disengage." Valda posited, Qilue reread the list and felt a knot form in her stomach as she agreed. "Anything else?"</p>
<p>"Some of these glyphs will last long after I've ordered the skeletons to disengage. I'd like a glyph of dispel to apply to you when everything's done." Qilue requested.</p>
<p>"No can do, you're going to be naked and I don't want you to have to hold onto a glyph of dispel the entire time. How about this arrangement, I give a glyph of dispel to a skeleton and adjust what orders they will take from you? I will make it so they will only take orders from you regarding glyphs, so you will be able to order them to apply the dispel glyph to me. However I will make it so they will disregard the order unless you have first ordered them to apply a random glyph to you instead of me. Now that's a complex piece of preparation, the price of that would be that you will have your hands chained behind your back, and a collar with a leash attached to my collar for the adventure." Qilue chewed on this latest demand, it was a lot for her to believe.</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>"Alright," she finally agreed. "I think we have everything we need planned.</p>
<p>Qilue was surprised at how quickly Valda had everything set up, that her eagerness for adventure would drive her through the preparation so fast. Conversely Qilue had found herself savouring the anticipation, she had barely stripped down to her underwear by the time Valda had the collar around her neck, the strength draining glyphs applied to her body, and was tapping her feet impatiently.</p>
<p>Qilue nervously took off her underwear and picked up the chain on the back of Valda's collar, clipping it onto her own collar and feeling her body become a wave of tingles. Her voice faltering, she was barely able to squeak out her command.</p>
<p>"Begin the adventure."</p>
<p>Immediately she watched the skeletons materialise out of the floor. One grabbed the leash and clipped it around Valda's collar, while a second got to work using manacles to secure her hands behind her back. Qilue felt very aware that she was more vulnerable than Valda, if anything went wrong Valda could bust out the moment her herculean strength was no longer restricted by magic, but Qilue was stuck until Valda freed her. What if Valda chose not to free her?</p>
<p>The skeleton yanked on the leash, Valda and Qilue immediately wincing at their sudden jerk forward, and the sound of a loud snap as the initial jerk broke the Skeleton's finger. The support skeleton fixed up his friend, whose pace was not even slowed by the breakage, before picking a glyph out of the bag and reading it so as to follow the instructions left for him by Valda.</p>
<p>He carefully placed the glyph onto Valda's left breast, immediately sparks began to fly as an arc of electricity connected from the skeletal hand to Valda's nipple, the skeleton then touched Valda's other nipple and the arc of electrical current flowed between them. Valda screamed through gritted teeth, and as the electricity discharged itself that scream transformed into an appreciative moan.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry master." Valda replied.</p>
<p>"So you're playing along?" Qilue asked.</p>
<p>"Of course, much more fun that way." Valda explained. Qilue thought on this as they began to explore the castle.</p>
<p>The castle was made of black rock, creating an imposing and evil facade as they passed innumerable magic torches and suits of armour. Occasionally they would enter a larger chamber where there was clear evidence that fighting had occurred.</p>
<p>"Hey Qilue. See that collapsed pillar on the floor to your left. That was me, I tackled a cultist right through that." Valda bragged.</p>
<p>"Did you plan this adventure imagining it as the consequences of if you had failed the mission to liberate the castle?"</p>
<p>"No, but let's pretend that's what happened." Valda said with a smirk before looking back towards the skeleton. "Alright, I'm sorry I attacked you, please don't make me into Lord Killshade's sex slave, I beg of you."</p>
<p>As Valda theatrically thrashed around, Qilue heard a snap from their captor and giggled at what was in store. The skeletal assistant picked another glyph out of the bag, slapping it on Valda without a care for precision. Colourful lights sparked out from where the glyph made contact, wrapping themselves around the leash, splitting it in two and smoothly attaching newly formed clips to Valda's nipples, their bouncing from Valda's fearful dance doing nothing for the spell's accuracy.</p>
<p>"Sorry master, I will be a good prisoner from now on." Valda replied as she felt her nipples begin to stretch with the pressure to keep walking.</p>
<p>"Looks like Lord Killshade wants your nipples punished by the time you are handed over to him." Qilue commented.</p>
<p>"Please let my friend go, I'll take all the punishment you want but she's innocent." Valda began to plead.</p>
<p>"I think we both know I'm not innocent." Qilue quipped.</p>
<p>"Come on, don't break the fantasy." Valda implored.</p>
<p>"How's this for breaking the fantasy?" Qilue stopped dead still, the felt the pressure build up against her neck and then a squeak from Valda as another snap echoed through the dungeon.</p>
<p>"You bitch." Valda yelled in shock as the skeleton picked out another glyph. As it was applied, a command echoed through the castle hallways from the glyph, a command clearly heard by Qilue, and immediately obeyed by Valda.</p>
<p>"Piss!"</p>
<p>The sound of urine trickling onto the floor filled the captive's ears.</p>
<p>"Oh disgusting, I'm stepping in your piss barefoot." Qilue moaned as the skeleton continued to drag them around the castle.</p>
<p>"Serves you right for pulling that stunt." Valda squealed through her embarrassment.</p>
<p>The skeleton ended up dragging them on a big loop of the castle back to the point where they had started, and then down a familiar path.</p>
<p>"No, that's the corridor that leads to the closet." Qilue noticed, beginning to struggle against her bonds.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, there's four or five different routes from this corridor, it would be super unlucky to get that one specific one." Valda reassured.</p>
<p>"That's all very well and good for you to say, you're wearing a ring of disguise."</p>
<p>"And you can stop this at any moment, relax and enjoy the humiliation." Valda tried to assert, but it didn't stop Qilue's wiggling from pulling the leash tight against Valda's nipples and snapping another finger. The skeletal assistant applied a glyph to Valda and at first it seemed like nothing was happening. Then out of nowhere Valda released a roar of fear and began thrashing against her restraints. The thrashing didn't affect the skeleton's journey, getting ever closer to the closet door, but it did snap off another finger to trigger more reprisals. The skeletal assistant picked out a glyph, studied it, then slapped it on Valda's bottom.</p>
<p>Green vines sprouted from the glyph, menacingly growing in size with razor sharp thorns emerging at the end, then in a sudden flick, a crack echoed in the corridor and a bright red welt started to rise from Valda's bottom.</p>
<p>"Ow, I'm sorry master, I will behave, please don't..." Valda pleaded with genuine fear as the thorny vine whipped over Valda's bottom again, and her squeals filled the corridors. "Master please, I'm sorry, don't..." another crack filled the corridor and Valda was silenced, simply reduced to a shivering husk as the last of the whips cracked across her bottom and the vine fell to the floor.</p>
<p>"Valda are you OK?"</p>
<p>"Just behave and master won't hurt us." Valda mumbled. In the silence the skeleton turned away from the closet door, heading into a room just before it. Qilue started to wonder if Valda's submission had had any effect on the sadism of the mindless skeletons, that they had somehow seen her contricion and decided she no longer needed to be dragged round the streets of Fountainwood. The skeleton pulled them around a well stocked library before leaving the room and heading away from the closet. They walked in silence a bit, before Qilue noticed Valda perk up somewhat.</p>
<p>"I regret the fear spell," she announced.</p>
<p>"So you don't like being afraid?" Qilue asked with the sensitivity of her former days as Valda's therapist.</p>
<p>"I don't mind fear that spurs me on to action, but that was crippling fear, it paralysed me, paralysed all other emotions, took away my agency..." Valda explained.</p>
<p>"And this prisoner fantasy doesn't remove your agency?"</p>
<p>"Not entirely, now that I'm back to enjoying myself I can do this." Valda announced, putting her foot down and feeling her nipples strain against the leash until the telltale snap of boney fingers filled the corridor.</p>
<p>The skeletal assistant picked out a glyph, then very carefully applied it to Valda's clitoris. Immediately Valda began to moan and dance on the spot.</p>
<p>"Eek, It's freezing my clitoris." She yelled as Qilue giggled at the state her friend had put herself in.</p>
<p>The skeleton continued pulling Valda and Qilue down the corridor, Valda squirming with the feeling of her labia churning against her frozen clit. Then all of a sudden it took a left turn, it stopped to run its finger down a pillar, generating hum from a nearby wall that the skeleton then walked straight through. Valda was confused as she followed it through the illusion, but she was at least more used to these things than Qilue, who when faced with walking into a wall reacted naturally and tried to avoid it. As the leash pulled hard to pull her through the illusion, Qilue gasped at the room she now found herself in, meanwhile the skeleton fixed its friend's finger and picked out a glyph for Valda.</p>
<p>This room was far more active than the castle they had come from, it seemed to emanate a faint purple glow, as books and tables shuffled around on their own, mops and dusters maintained the area, every surface and item seemed saturated with magic to serve a master no longer there. They both stared in wonder as the skeleton applied a glyph to Valda causing the hero to jump in shock.</p>
<p>"Qilue, I think I have just been deafened." Valda yelled, Qilue thought about replying but then figured there wouldn't be a point. Qilue thought about how this was now a bad situation, they didn't know what lay in this section of the castle, still with active magic and who knows what lurking within, however part of her embraced the fear, swum in the excitement of the new unpredictable direction their journey had taken. The skeleton dragged them immediately to the left, to another corridor leading out of the room, lit by purple torchlight.</p>
<p>Qilue knew she should be ordering the adventure over, but her mind began to swim in the fantasy of becoming a prisoner for real. What if there is some unknown wizard's apprentice ready to fuck her, or some extra-planer entity ready to keep them in a state of permanent humiliation. Throughout all the fantasies flowing through her mind, Qilue's rational brain was able to keep up a repeating refrain, 'call it off, it's time to stop.' Qilue felt a pang of regret as she gave the command.</p>
<p>"Alright skeletal minions, apply one glyph to me so I can give the order to disengage." The skeleton's malicious gaze turned to Qilue. She let out a little whimper as her oppressor removed a Glyph from his bag and pressed it against her arm. The familiar voice of command echoed in the corridor, only this time it was Qilue felt pulled by an irresistible compulsion to obey.</p>
<p>"Beg!"</p>
<p>Qilue's brain was no longer processing, it simply reacted. She knew that she had to beg, but the force of the command gave no direction beyond that. To her own shock she found that she began to beg along the lines of the thought process interrupted by the command, unable to stop her traitorous mouth.</p>
<p>"Please make me your slave, I beg of you." She began to plead. "I mean it, I want to be your horny humiliated prisoner forever. Please make this my new life, I want to be exposed, I want to be degraded and laughed at, I want to be abused and violated. I don't want Valda to free me. Please master, tear up that glyph of dispel and treat us as fuckmeat prisoners forever."</p>
<p>Qilue gasped with horror as the skeleton actually obeyed her request and ripped up the glyph of dispel. She screamed but still under the command spell she knew she needed to beg, luckily the ripped up glyph focused her mind on what she should have been begging for.</p>
<p>"Please don't do this, I beg of you, put that glyph back together and let us go." The skeleton impassively ignored her. "Please sir, or if that isn't possible, find another glyph of dispel and use that on Valda." Qilue broke out the fog of the command spell and immediately started to panic and think through what was happening.</p>
<p>"Valda said they would obey any commands to do with glyphs, so naturally he obeyed when I told him to rip up the glyph, however he's not obeying any more, even though I'm giving him new glyph related commands." Qilue splurged to herself. "Wait, ripping up the glyph was not the full command, the full command was 'tear up the Glyph and treat us as fuckmeat prisoners.' Fuckmeat prisoners don't have their orders obeyed by their captors." Qilue felt her body begin to fill with dread.</p>
<p>"Valda, something's gone wrong." She yelled, but Valda didn't hear her. Nevertheless Valda was able to deduce something wasn't right when the skeleton holding her leash suddenly did a U-turn in the middle of the corridor. Valda had told them to pick a random direction every time there was a fork in the road, they were only to do U-turns at dead ends, to suddenly turn around in the middle of a hallway was unusual. She had the briefest of moments to see the fear on Qilue's face as she passed her and then the reality of their ordeal began to sit on her stomach.</p>
<p>Valda knew this could turn from bad to worse if she didn't do something, she needed a plan and fast.</p>
<p>"Qilue!" Valda yelled over her deafness. "On the count of three, I'm going to pull hard, as should you. Together we should be able to rip all the skeleton's fingers off and make a run for it." Qilue got ready and braced herself as the hero counted down, then on three they both planted their feet and pulled in the other direction.</p>
<p>Valda's nipples exploded with pain as she felt the leash snap tight but she endured and kept pulling. One by one she heard the pop of skeletal fingers snapping out of their sockets, each time loosening the leash just a little. Then to her shock, Valda watched the second skeleton grab the leash and yank his prisoners forward. Clearly when the skeleton heard the order to treat them like fuckmeat prisoners, not letting them escape was part of the deal.</p>
<p>The skeleton healed up his friend, counting that Valda had broken three fingers, and so three glyphs were the appropriate punishment. He took the first glyph out of the bag and slapped it on Valda's face.</p>
<p>Suddenly a swarm of magical insects arose from the ground, covering Valda. She squirmed and wiggled to get the insects off her exposed body, her every scream of disgust followed by gagging and spitting as the insects crawled into her mouth, her exposed body reduced to a pile of filth. Infestation would certainly be added to the list of glyphs she regretted choosing. The spell was just to summon the swarm, so Valda's body was still covered in the infestation as the skeleton applied the next glyph.</p>
<p>A familiar commanding voice echoed out from Valda, filling the air with its potent order. Even without her hearing, Valda magically knew the order that had been given and that she could not refuse.</p>
<p>"Orgasm!"</p>
<p>For Valda the disgust and arousal spiralled through her body, her filthy perversion now thrown into her face as she moaned in orgasmic joy, every skittering insect driving her body's sensitivity wild as the swarm began to fall to the wayside leaving behind whichever insect stragglers managed to cling on. Qilue felt bad for the hero as she moaned and squirmed with the most degrading orgasm conceivable as the skeleton applied another glyph.</p>
<p>Qilue wondered what this most recent glyph did as it didn't seem to have an immediate effect, it only became clear when Valda continued to scream with her artificial orgasm, her legs shaking at the effort. Qilue deduced that the skeleton must have just applied the glyph of empowerment, making Valda's orgasm longer and more intense. Qilue's stomach dropped at the realisation that this meant the strength draining glyphs were empowered, extending their situation for another hour.</p>
<p>Valda's screams echoed through the castle as the skeleton's direction stopped being a meandering jaunt and started being a purposeful prisoner transport. Eventually Valda gave one final moan and was able to climax to her order's satisfaction, clearing her head as the skeleton unlocked a thick reinforced door.</p>
<p>They entered a tunnel, a long echoing corridor with no doors or branching paths, an inevitable sense of final destination shuddered through Valda and Qilue. As they descended, they saw a portal, it had purple borders and seemed to extrude an uneasy energy.</p>
<p>"Shit!" Valda yelled, "Qilue, we do not want to go through that portal. That is a planar door, it leads to a demiplane, and if I had to guess, I would say it goes to some kind of demiplane dungeon where Lord Killshade and his minions locked up those who opposed him." It made sense to Qilue, she ordered the skeletons to treat them like prisoners, so they had decided to take them to get locked in the dungeon. Her mind buzzed trying to think of how they could escape and her mind drew a blank. Valda also desperately thought through any schemes that would fix the situation, but the only plan that broke through the fog of fear in her mind was the same plan as before.</p>
<p>"Alright Qilue, we're going to try pulling again, I'm going to count to three and then you run in the opposite direction." Valda instructed. Qilue got ready to brace herself. Valda counted down from three and Qilue turned and ran forward, ignoring the tightening leash and the screams of pain from Valda. They heard five distinct snaps, the last of which heralded a sudden drop in pressure as the leash fell to the floor, they began to desperately sprint for their freedom. Qilue actually let a smile crawl across her face as she saw the light of the tunnel entrance, but her salvation was not to last as she felt the leash once again go taut, stopping her in her tracks. The second skeleton, upon seeing his fleeing prisoners, had stepped on the leash, pulling Valda to a jerking stop by her nipples.</p>
<p>Valda and Qilue cried in frustration as the skeleton gave the leash back to his recently healed friend and picked out some more glyphs as they walked towards the inevitable demiplane dungeon. The first glyph was slapped on with malicious recklessness. As it hit Valda's skin, dancing lights flitted around her leash as the prestidigitation spell unclipped it from her nipples, then attached the leash to her clit. Valda screamed with the new sensation, now painfully aware that her plan could not be repeated as she felt the tug on the most sensitive part of her crotch. The skeleton grabbed another glyph and slapped it onto Valda.</p>
<p>Valda was a bit confused that the most recent glyph didn't seem to do anything, but she wasn't standing where Qilue was, watching Valda's skin darken, her trademark scars revealing themselves and the illusionary long blonde hair retreating back to her distinctive mohican. Qilue hoped nobody was in this demiplane dungeon because Valda just lost her disguise.</p>
<p>Over the next few moments, the world moved in slow motion for Qilue, as the skeleton leading the prisoner procession crossed the threshold of the dungeon and disappeared into the shimmering portal, his friend slapped another glyph on Valda. Qilue watched as the hero was drawn towards her mysterious fate, while her body became desecrated with the illusion of thick globules of cum covering her exposed flesh.</p>
<p>The next glyph was applied just as Valda crossed over the threshold into the portal and disappeared beyond the shimmering air. Qilue felt alone and terrified as she was pulled towards her fate, closing her eyes and screaming as she was pulled through the planar doorway.</p>
<p>Qilue's eyes remained closed as she felt the waft of cold air hit her on the other side of the portal. The ground was somehow even colder than the hewn stone she had just been walking on, and her ears were filled with a low rumbling sound coming from all around, interrupted by painful moans and squeals of her partner, seeming to boom out from her far louder than natural. The skeleton had applied the Thaumeturgy spell, with the glyph of enhancement it was like every tiny noise Valda made was being played through a megaphone.</p>
<p>Qilue opened her eyes and was immediately struck by how bright everything was. She was in a tunnel made of ice, shimming in brilliant blue, lit by the sunlight from the frozen wasteland that surrounded the ice prison they were in. Qilue was able to see through most of the walls, and what scared her was the sight of movement further down the tunnel, it was no longer just them and the skeletons.</p>

<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>While Qilue was still taking in her new surroundings, the skeleton still had one more glyph to apply to Valda, and it did so with relish, slapping it on her breasts.</p>
<p>The tunnel led out to a large room filled with crystalline cages and sneering guards of the largest races from the most brutal cultures. Valda saw cages filled with people she recognised from her adventures, those who had stood up to Lord Killshade and then disappeared, enemies whose own rise to power threatened her former enemy's dominance, even people who had sheltered and help her during her quest. Huge numbers of people significant to Valda's life seemed to be in this prison, as well as a whole bunch of others that had found themselves captured by Zenith's most evil villain. She hoped that nobody would notice her, or maybe just the ones in the closest cells. But then a thorny vine whipped itself over Valda's exposed breast, causing her to scream out in pain with a scream amplified six times louder by the Thaumaturgy spell.</p>
<p>Suddenly every single eye in the prison was on her as her breasts were mercilessly whipped by thorns. Their initial shock giving way to a roar of cheers each time they heard the sound of a cracking whip followed by Valda's screams of degraded pain. The skeleton took Valda and Qilue past a row of catcalling prisoners to a desk with a giant grinning Cyclops watching his new prisoners squirm.</p>
<p>"I could have sworn the western castle fell to Valda and her friends, yet now it seems it was Valda that fell." The cyclops leered. "With the one who vanquished him under my command, hopefully the resurrection of our dark lord won't face any more roadblocks. Hell he will probably give me untold riches ensuring you are at his mercy when he returns." Qilue keenly listened because she knew Valda couldn't. "Who sent you?"</p>
<p>The skeletons remained impassive, they did not have the ability to speak so they had nothing to do but wait for the warden to tell them what to do with their prisoner.</p>
<p>"Alright, the cloak and dagger stuff gets annoying when we're all on the same team but that's fine. Walk this humiliated former hero and her friend around the prison, make sure anyone who thinks their salvation is coming sees the legend of Zenith, captured naked and covered in cum. Then lock them in cell 66." The cyclops ordered, watching with joy as the skeletons obeyed his demand and led away the humiliated prisoners.</p>
<p>Qilue felt like Valda may actually be lucky to be deafened at this moment as the yells of the prisoners would have cut through her hard.</p>
<p>"I see Zenith's mightiest hero is now its dirtiest whore. I hope Killshade takes you down a peg before he comes from me." A large man with huge scars yelled, Qilue got the impression that those scars were a gift from Valda.</p>
<p>"Tell me it isn't so. Our hero has been captured and desecrated, who will save us now." An elderly priest yelled.</p>
<p>A tall thin man in a cloak pushed himself at the edge of his cell, Qilue didn't understand why until she saw his cock in his hand and a spurt of cum landing on Valda's calf. "That's for thwarting my glorious designs at Daggerpoint." He spat.</p>
<p>Qilue felt terrible, it would have been bad enough to be in this situation alone, or even the centre of attention, but seeing Valda taking the brunt of humiliation for her mistake was somehow even worse. She was her therapist and now Valda was facing the ultimate destruction of her reputation and reverence because of her.</p>
<p>After a lap of all the cells, Valda's feet and calves were covered in semen from the prisoners with a grudge and a hand on their cock. One impressive half-orc prisoner managed to cum on her thigh but in general she was too far away from the cells. The skeleton's led her away from the main area of cells and to a dark tunnel, they unlocked the metal barred door and threw Valda and Qilue inside, only releasing them from their manacles through the bars once the cell was locked.</p>
<p>The cell was clearly designed to hold the strongest prisoners, it seemed like it had been hewn right into the rocks below the ground, the only surface not made of rock was the thick barred door they came in through, now with two skeletal guards standing outside to make extra certain their prisoners don't escape.</p>
<p>Valda and Qilue sat in silence, stewing in their situation, desperately trying to think of how they were going to escape this, and if they did escape how they were going to explain what had happened.</p>
<p>Eventually, Qilue saw the magical glyphs fade from Valda's skin, now was the time to start working things out.</p>
<p>"Valda, you have your strength back now." Qilue informed, Valda jumped at the sudden sensation of sound but didn't mind as she tested her strength against the bars. She strained and grunted but they were not moving an inch even with her full herculean force at work.</p>
<p>"They aren't budging." Valda sighed. "We'll just have to be patient and wait for an opportunity.</p>
<p>"Bullshit." Qilue replied. "The longer we are here, the more of your enemies see you like this. Not to mention we are captive by people trying to bring back Lord Killshade. What if we're being patient and then one day you see his face leering down at you."</p>
<p>"Demiplane portals need high level magical maintenance every so often, that means there's some powerful wizards behind this who will be on their way the moment they get word I'm in here, maybe one will get sloppy and I can take them hostage."</p>
<p>"Or maybe they'll drain your strength without glyphs. Maybe you'll end up a living fuck-statue in their throne room for the rest of your life." Qilue ranted.</p>
<p>"Yes Qilue, I'm scared too." Valda interrupted. "Giving into that fear isn't going to get us anywhere. Fucking hell, you're a therapist, what do you tell people who are this scared?"</p>
<p>Qilue ran through her guide to panic attacks, breathing in through her nose and out through her mouth while thinking of 10 things she will do when the situation is over. Her heartbeat slowed and she was able to calm herself enough to think straight.</p>
<p>"Those skeletons can lock and unlock cells, if only they were still under our command." Qilue lamented before her face lit up with an idea. "They technically are still under our command, they just aren't accepting new orders."</p>
<p>"You say that like it changes our situation."</p>
<p>"It does. If you were to throw that manicle hard and accurately enough to break the skeleton's finger. They would have to apply a glyph to you."</p>
<p>"Qilue you genius. They'd have to unlock the cage to come get me and I could smash them to smithereens." Valda cheered, leaping to her feet to pick up the manacles previously on her wrists.</p>
<p>Qilue had a knot in her stomach, she prayed that Valda could hit a skeleton's hand from the cell, she had no idea that with Valda's strength and practice, she was deadlier and more accurate throwing things than most archers were with the best bows and arrows available. She flung the manacles and smiled as it basically obliterated the skeleton's hand. As predicted the helper skeleton opened the cage and began to approach Valda with a glyph, when Valda moved with lightning speed and wrenched the skeleton apart by the ribcage.</p>
<p>"Alright! Now we just need to get out of here." Qilue celebrated.</p>
<p>"You need to get out of here. I need to stay and do what I do best, be a hero." Valda grinned.</p>
<p>"Valda, we can come back..."</p>
<p>"No we can't, you heard me earlier, the most powerful of this organisation are probably on their way here. If we leave they'll close off the portal and we won't be able to stop them. But if I stay and fight, they'll probably want to take me down in my weakened state, no allies, no armour, no weapons." Valda resolutely explained as she punched the other skeleton to dust.</p>
<p>"You think you could take them on in your state?"</p>
<p>"No, but I think I can stall them. I'll be the distraction as you go back to Fountainwood, on the kitchen counter is a strange rock with a bunch of glyphs on it. Run your finger down the centre and say 'code black.' It will instantly get Infernazarr's attention and he will portal the rest of the gang together. Then the phrase you're going to need to use is 'I'll explain on the way.' as you bring them here." Valda planned as she grabbed the bag of healing glyphs and slapped a few onto her.</p>
<p>"So you're going to let your old adventuring party see you in this state?"</p>
<p>"If we are successful I can claim the whole imprisonment thing was a ruse to get the skeletons to bring us here and to get the bad guys to let their guard down." Valda explained as she handed Qilue the other bag of glyphs. "These aren't strong attacks, use them to distract and flee. Save the blindness one for the most dire situation."</p>
<p>Qilue saw Valda at her strongest and bravest, and tried to mirror that energy for the task ahead, after all Valda was risking her freedom, dignity and future on this plan. Everything was riding on Qilue getting back to Zenith and getting Valdas friends together in time. Qilue had more questions but Valda had already charged down the hall with a howl of rage.</p>
<p>Valda spat a mouthful of blood onto the ice cold metal floor as three hooded figures moved their hordes of monsters to surround her.</p>
<p>"Valda Stormaxe, Zenith's mightiest hero, alone, naked, and defeated at our hands.' One of the wizards drooled, letting arcs of electricity play around his hands. "Maybe if you surrender now, we won't finish you off."</p>
<p>"Yeah, seeing as you're already dressed for it, maybe you could convince me to keep you alive as my sex slave." Another hooded figure added, Valda considered his offer, and how funny it would be to crush his cock with her pussy, but instead opted for a more direct expression of her feelings.</p>
<p>"I will never submit to the likes of you, if you want me, you're going to have to fuck my corpse." She sneered, unsteadily pulling herself upright, her naked body shivering in the cold.</p>
<p>"If that's the way you want to be. I guess we'll kill you and see if you're more compliant when we bring you back as a mindless undead servant." A hooded wizard chuckled, collecting a deep dark ball of necrotic energy in his hands. Just as he was about to fling it at Valda, his hands seemed to become sticky, interfering with his complex hand movements. "Who dares counterspell me?"</p>
<p>Valda's determined gritted teeth turned to a relaxed grin, her hunched posture straightened up to become strong and resolute, she slapped a couple more healing glyphs on herself and turned to see her adventuring friends, in their fearsome fighting pose, sizing up the room of monsters, cultists, and villainy ahead of them.</p>
<p>"Thank God you guys finally came, you know had badly I had to look like I was losing to keep those ringleaders here, I was ten minutes away from fucking them." Valda leapt across the room, slamming herself into the Cyclops and snatching the masterctafted battle hammer he had been inexpertly wielding. "I've had my eyes on this hammer for so long. Now let's see how well it works."</p>
<p>The hoards took one step back as Valda surged with rage and power, more than prepared for the bloodbath that was about to commence.</p>
<p>"Given recent events, I figured it only appropriate to schedule your supervision for the whole afternoon." Gelmar Springleaf explained as Qilue sat up straight on his sofa. "I must also inform you that other directors of the guild of therapists have asked me to feed back to them on concerns we all have."</p>
<p>"Concerns?" Qilue innocently asked.</p>
<p>"This is not a disciplinary interview. We are not using accusations as discussion points. How about you explain the events of the last few weeks from your perspective?" The supervisor stroked his beard before pulling out his notepad.</p>
<p>Qilue went over the story she had agreed with Valda. The same story they had told to all the press, that they went on to give in speeches at events thanking them for stopping the ritual that would have brought back an immortal Lord Killshade. That Qilue had told the crowd just before the city council announced the new marble statue of 'Qilue, the sixth saviour of Zenith' to be placed on the road of heroes next to Valda and her adventuring party.</p>
<p>Qilue told Gelmar of Valda's hunch that taking down a single castle of cultists may not have finished off the plot to revive Lord Killshade, and that doubt plagued her mind. Then, thanks to Qilue's fantastic therapy, she realised she needed to have confidence in her mind as well as her body, so she came up with a plan to get herself captured to confirm her theory. As she felt like it was something she had to do for herself, she didn't ask her friends for help, but couldn't think of anyone she could trust more than Qilue to be there to make sure everything went alright.</p>
<p>Then everything went wrong and Qilue got captured as well, but when they were locked up together, Qilue thought of a plan to escape, then snuck through the hordes of Killshade's forces, at one point even coming face to face with an ogre and dodging his swings long enough to blind him with a glyph. Once free she got word to Valda's friends and gave them such detailed intel that Infernazarr gave her command of the castle's skeletons to help in the battle.</p>
<p>The battle was tough, and partway through the cultists began the ritual out of desperation. This was why Lord Killshade's shadow-minions reappeared all across Zenith, ravaging the area in the short period of time it took the heroes to reach the ritual site and shut it down. Now the cult is scattered, their leaders dead and prisoners freed, and not only is Qilue a household name, but getting therapy is no longer a niche and frowned upon activity.</p>
<p>"That is a fascinating story, very enjoyable. Tell me about being captured and stripped naked." Gelmar enquired.</p>
<p>"It was embarrassing, why do you want to focus on that?"</p>
<p>"Because it seems like something worth drilling down into. I have Valda's therapy notes here, you have told me about her enjoyment of displays of sexual vulnerability, and then a story hits the papers about her, and you, being seen chained up and naked at the hands of skeletons you admit she had command over. Considering we cannot see any therapeutic reason for you to be part of Valda's plan, we are worried about your professional boundaries. Even the most innocent read of the situation has you putting yourself at an unacceptable risk by being there, and we have troubling speculations about the nature of your participation in Valda's plan."</p>
<p>"You think the final defeat of Killshade's forces started out as a sexual game of Valda's, one that I was participating in?"</p>
<p>"You understand that with the newfound focus on therapy as a discipline, we would have to be extra conscious of lapses in professional standards from someone given the role of spokesperson through providence." Gelmar explained. Qilue struggled to hold back a scowl at the pomposity that had just been instilled in her supervisor from jumped up office politics. Clearly he was looking to get in good with the guild, capitalising on his supervisee's success.</p>
<p>"So the directors want to make this political, do they?" Qilue mused. "Fine, since this is no longer a forum for my professional and mental well-being, let's play the political game. My association with Valda has followed an unconventional path, a path that I will not be detailing to you or anyone else. A path that has led to half the city either seeking therapy or training to be a therapist because of the story I am a part of. For now the story is that I am a legend because I am a therapist, what do you think would happen if you opened disciplinaries against me that clearly signalled that I am a legend despite being a therapist?"</p>
<p>"The directors are eager not to have our association with you blow up in our faces."</p>
<p>"Then you best leave this alone. I will make sure it blows up in your face if you try and butt in, hell I wonder if they have considered the consequences of me starting a rival guild. However it only might blow up in your face if you tolerate my school of therapy, and crucially you and your directors will have time to build a formidable guild before facing those challenges."</p>
<p>"You never used to be the sort of person who would be so cavalier with their future and extortive with your guild."</p>
<p>"What can I say, I am now one of Zenith's greatest heroes, and I get paid well, by a client I actually like, to..." Qilue trailed off and shot her supervisor a cheeky grin. "Well I guess that doesn't concern you any more."</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Qilue couldn't believe the life she now had, the life Valda had been living for some time when she first knocked on Qilue's door asking for help with her general malaise. As she walked down the street people cheered for her, if her walk slowed too much she would soon find herself having to navigate a crowd of well-wishers, stores and merchants climbed over one another to give her free stuff. She had requests from the wealthiest and most influential people to be their therapist, but she had to put that on hold as her office was so swamped with well-wishers she couldn't guarantee anyone privacy. Infernazarr said he would get her a demi-plane of her own in exchange for his first few therapy sessions being on the house, but he said it would take a week to put together</p>
<p>In the meantime, Qilue relished the quiet as she ducked down an alleyway and into the familiar Fountainwood apartment of Valda. From there she made her way to the second closet and down into the castle, giggling at the echoing sounds of her footsteps in the empty halls, retracing her steps through the fake magic wall, down the ominous tunnel, and into the ice prison where Valda was waiting for her.</p>
<p>"I really love the quiet these days, I never realised what a precious commodity it was until the world wanted to loudly congratulate me." Qilue mused.</p>
<p>"Yeah, now you know what it's like to be famous, no more stripping at the Thrusting Rapier without a disguise for you."</p>
<p>"Oh, do you think the people I stripped for will remember me? Do you think one day one of them will be walking down the road of heroes and think 'hang on, that statue there, I swear I've seen her pussy and ass inches from my face while she exposed herself for tips.'"</p>
<p>"You see what I mean about wanting a statue of me wearing less than my loincloth?"</p>
<p>"At least they can see your body, I'm in my professional suit, looking proper and decent. The statues should be of the two of us, naked and being pulled along by the skeleton."</p>
<p>"Well that's a thought, though I am glad you now have as much to lose as me if you get exposed, it means we're playing for the same stakes." Valda opined as she began laying out some bags and boxes on the floor in front of them. "So, are you looking forward to your week off?"</p>
<p>"Depends what you have planned." Qilue replied, uneasily looking around the demi-plane dungeon that was almost her ruin.</p>
<p>"Well it's simple, I'm going to be your naked prisoner. You can lock me up in any cell, put me through any torture you see fit, you will even have a unit of skeletal guards to carry out any command you give them. You have a sack of strength draining glyphs here, but also another sack of far more interesting glyphs. I finally found out where in the castle skeletons were getting all those additional glyphs from the first adventure that went wrong, there's a whole library/armoury of them in a hidden room, believe me I chose some good ones for you to have at your fingertips." Qilue idly rummaged through the glyph bag, catching sight of a variety of malicious and uncomfortable spells.</p>
<p>"Now to make it fun I have made a game of this. Inside this box is a leash and chain, but it is locked, the only way to unlock it is with a codeword that I currently know. Your mission is to get that codeword out of me. The only rule is you can't use any of those command glyphs to force me to tell you, you'll have to humiliate it out of me. If you get me to give you the codeword, my punishment is to put on that leash and give it to a skeleton with the command 'take this prisoner to the most humiliating place.' However, if you cannot get the codeword out of me before the strength draining glyphs run out, by my calculation in three days time, you will become my prisoner for the remainder of the week."</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>"I was wondering when my pussy would be on the line." Qilue sung.</p>
<p>"Oh don't worry, there is a locked box with a leash for you, I've even restrained myself from cheating and reading the codeword my merchant wrote on this scroll for you. I wonder where the skeleton's will take you if you crack under my interrogation?" Valda taunted, looming over Qilue.</p>
<p>"You'll find out first hand when I break you, don't forget I'm a therapist, I know all your mental weaknesses."</p>
<p>"Ah, shit. Well if that's how you're going to be I'll let you in on something that was going to be a surprise. You know how I'm so strong we need magic to bring me down. I've decided you have a similar problem, so I bought these." Valda took out another bag full of glyphs. "These are intelligence draining glyphs, if you don't break me in the next couple of days, I will make you a mindless fuck-slave in no time."</p>
<p>"Alright, let's play. Come on Valda Stormaxe, hero of Zenith, strip off your clothes so I can start slapping glyphs on those slutty tits of yours." Qilue ordered.</p>
<p>"Yes warden." Valda replied as she began to peel off her clothes. "Do your worst, it will make it that much more satisfying when it's my turn to play with the degraded slut who used to be Dr. Qilue Mylyl, hero of Zenith."</p>
