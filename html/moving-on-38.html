<p>The vacuum cleaner made a familiar crackle as it sucked up the sand often tracked from the beach onto the carpet by careless guests. Elizabeth didn't mind, on the days her cleaner couldn't make it she took comfort in the diligent cleaning only someone who cared as much as her could provide.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was the landlady of four holiday rental properties, but the beachfront condo in South Oregon meant the most to her, it was her first property, the only one she had bought with Jamal. She smiled knowingly as she wiped that bit of the doorway alcove the cleaner always seemed to miss, she gave the house such care as it was the legacy of the only man to care about her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had met Jamal on the set of Altogether Found, a sitcom about a multi-ethnic adopted family coming to terms with their identities as best as they could while being written by an all white writing team. It was drivel, but Elizabeth's parents pushed her for the role of Bao, a spunky Japanese girl who was terrible at maths.</p>
<p>She first met Jamal at the cast party following her successful auditions. While her parents were preening and circulating, telling anyone who would hear them about how excited Lizzy was to play her heritage, Jamal was the only one who listened to her complain that she was Thai, playing a Japanese girl with a Chinese name. Similarly she loved listening to the thoughtful teenager elucidate that treating his character, a nerdy black kid, as some sort of crazy anomaly was pretty messed up as well. The whole thing was tone deaf, bland, and stupid, naturally there were 8 seasons and it only ended when Elizabeth and Jamal turned 18 and publically turned their back on the show, their parents, and acting in general.</p>
<p>The headlines were relentless, first at the news that two actors who played siblings on TV were actually dating, then that they were so scathing about the show that had made their careers, and finally that they hated the show so much they even estranged themselves from their parents for forcing them to work through their childhood.</p>
<p>With all the Altogether Found money suddenly available to them, they started investing in real estate, it was the safest place to put their money and secure a future free of fan meetups and spin off pitches. The beach house was to be the first of many in their joint empire, Jamal was even finding some great houses on his laptop as he recovered from surgery on his kidney, surgery that was unsuccessful in removing all the cancer that clung to him.</p>
<p>It was now a year since Elizabeth cried next to an empty bed Jamal was supposed to return to after routine tests. She dropped a bottle of champagne into the fridge, a welcoming burst of happiness that kept the good reviews coming in, some happy couple was going to look out over the beach and dream their own dreams in the house, the life, that Jamal had planned with Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Elizabeth's face turned red with fury and confusion as she scrolled back to the start of the video. The busty co-ed and her sugar daddy were writhing with each other on the white corner sofa Elizabeth and Jamal agreed filled the living room so perfectly. She jumped forward to the busty blonde woman, cinematically thrusting her head back and forward on a large muscular man's penis in front of the huge french windows that Elizabeth had to scream at the handyman to come reinstall when it started leaking on the rain, warping the wooden laminate floor she was kneeling on.</p>
<p>Elizabeth even recognised the section of beach they were on as the blonde women went skinny dipping in the sea, then laughed as passers-by stared in disbelief. There was no doubt about it, that man had rented her house to shoot a porn movie.</p>
<p>She was sure it was the man as his profile on the porn website had the same man doing various things with various women. She scoured his profile looking for clues to who he was, page after page of women playing along with the muscular man's deviant desires. The stuff he had filmed at her house at the mild end of the scale, his brand being the total domination of the women enamoured by his wealth. While the man was an odious character, Elizabeth saw the look in his co-star's eyes and admired their devotion. She remembered her days giving her body to Jamal and swooned with the memories of their sexual exploits.</p>
<p>During one video, Elizabeth finally got the clue she needed, the main actor in the video was using a felt tip pen to write horrible things on the woman he was performing with. At one point he wrote 'Mike's cunt' on her pubis, and now Elizabeth had a name. She took a moment to compose herself, banishing the hour of smut she just ingested from her mind to focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked through her past rentals and found she had only twice rented the beach house to someone called Michael, but one of them was before she had gotten the fancy enamel paint for the kitchen walls, clearly visible in the scene where the man was spanking her with a wooden spatula that Elizabeth vowed to burn next time she was there.</p>
<p>She got up the contact details for Mike Hunt and full of rage and condemnation, she called his phone number.</p>
<p>"Hello" a surly voice answered.</p>
<p>"Is this Mike Hunt?" She pointedly asked.</p>
<p>"Who wants to know?"</p>
<p>"This is Elizabeth Kim, you rented a property from me four months ago, the beach house south of Gold Beach Oregon." She stated as clearly as she could.</p>
<p>"Yeah, so what? Hang on, where do I know that name from?" He absentmindedly mused.</p>
<p>"Probably from our conversations about renting my house. It has just been brought to my attention that you used my house to shoot a pornographic movie..."</p>
<p>"There was no rule against it." He interrupted.</p>
<p>"It was a private holiday rental and as such it wasn't zoned for movie production, let alone porn."</p>
<p>"That sounds more like a you problem, if your contracts don't forbid commercial recording you're the one who's liable, not me." Elizabeth quietly fumed, of course a long term porn producer like this guy would know the law. "Wait a moment, are you Lizzy Kim, from Altogether Found, I fucking loved that show."</p>
<p>"Don't change the subject, you are going to take that video down or I'm going to get my lawyers involved?"</p>
<p>"Yeah that's not going to happen. The way I see it you got three options: option one, you calm your tits, ignore this and not lose any sleep. Option two, start a big protracted legal battle that will cost you loads and not amount to anything. Option number three, which is the option I think will do you the most good, you could rent me the beach house again, put on something pretty, and come star in my next movie. What do you say?"</p>
<p>"You asshole, you're a dirty fucking pervert and you'll be hearing from my lawyers." Elizabeth hung up then almost smashed her phone slamming it on the counter.</p>
<p>The thoughts of what that man did in her house swirled around Elizabeth's mind until her lawyers were able to get back to her. It took them a week and as many billable hours as they could record to come to the conclusion that they could send Mike a cease and desist, but if he didn't abide by it they wouldn't have much of a leg to stand on in court. In the meantime they passed over a revised rental agreement to prevent this happening again.</p>
<p>Elizabeth arranged with the cleaner that the next time the house was free, she would clean it.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was due to drive to Oregon later that day, but first she had been informed by her lawyers that Mike had signed for their cease and desist letter and she was eager to see if he had taken down the video. She clicked through to his profile and saw he had re-uploaded the video, edited to include 'bonus content.'</p>
<p>Elizabeth clicked on the video and once again was treated to the sight of the scantily clad blonde first entering her rental property. Her stomach tingled with frustration as she once again watched through the woman's sexual degradation at her property. After sitting through all the twists and turns of the video and once again watching it fade to black as the cum covered woman squirmed on the luxurious double bed she had bought (and tried out) with Jamal, Elizabeth began to wonder if she had missed whatever editing had been done, but then Mike appeared again, now in his office staring at the camera vlog style.</p>
<p>"So an update on my escapades with Ginger. You're not going to believe this, but it turns out the house we filmed at is owned by Lizzy Kim. I got to fuck a slut in the beach house of Bao from Altogether Found." Elizabeth's lips curled into sneer that he would react to their phone calls this way. "Don't believe me, it turns out I was recording a video when she called, so I got our whole phone call on camera, take a listen."</p>
<p>The camera cut to a point of view shot of a young black woman, deep throating Mike with impressive vigour while Mike told her what a terrible job she was doing. A jaunty ringtone interrupted the scene but Mike was unperturbed.</p>
<p>"Alright bitch, blow me quieter I'm getting a phone call." He instructed before answering his phone on speakerphone. "Hello."</p>
<p>Elizabeth's eyes went wide as she heard her voice come out of his phone, that horrid man had a woman throat deep on his penis the entire call. He even put the camera to one side, so the audience could see the cheeky look on his face as he asked her if she wanted to be in his next film, she then got to see the aftermath of her swearing at him then hanging up.</p>
<p>"I can't believe I just spoke to Lizzy Kim on the phone while having my dick sucked. She was one of my first crushes, that episode where she thought she'd entered a swimming meet, but there was bad signal so she ended up doing a spelling bee in her swimming costume, I jacked it to that so many times." Elizabeth recoiled in her chair.</p>
<p>"I realise it's a bit sad to have your childhood crush hate you but come on, even on a one in a million chance I had to try to get her to be in one of my videos. I know Lizzy Kim would never agree to something like this but could you imagine if I was able to get Lizzy Kim on my channel? Bao sucking my cock and thanking me as I slapped her ass, spat in her face, wrote disgusting things on her body before covering her tits with my cum." Mike was lost in his fantasy as he came in the mouth of the girl he was working with as she gurgled it down. "Damn I usually last longer than that."</p>
<p>The video cut out but Mike had edited in one last insulting touch, a video of him and a woman he had sex with in the past (Elizabeth felt dirty that she was even able to remember the specific video he had got the footage from), only now Elizabeth's face had been crudely photoshopped over the model's and clips from her phone call had been cut together to form a disjointed sentance in her own voice that he played on repeat.</p>
<p>"Fuck... Mike Hunt... and... asshole."</p>
<p>Elizabeth gagged a little and closed the laptop, wondering why she had kept watching the video in the first place.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was on the phone to her lawyer the entire time as she drove to the beach house. They told her that although the initial cease and desist letter carried no weight, the new one would as he was using their recording for 'exploitative purposes' ("no fucking shit" replied Elizabeth). However they warned her that he could still win a court case as she was a public figure and he could argue that releasing your phone call was equivalent to a news organisation releasing an undercover sting on a politician.</p>
<p>"Fundamentally, it would be a long trial, and you have to ask yourself if you want to go through that considering the court case would only bring more attention to the video." The lawyer concluded.</p>
<p>"So you're telling me because my mum wanted me to be famous, I'm now fair game for any creep that wants to do something like this?" Elizabeth took the heavy silence as an uncomfortable answer in the affirmative. "I'll tell you what I'm going to do, I'm going to go to my fucking beach house, and do whatever it takes to forget about this. I'll call you on Wednesday when hopefully my eyes aren't about to pop out of my skull with stress."</p>
<p>Usually when Elizabeth crests the hill that gives her a view of the coast and her beach house, she feels herself relax, like returning to safety. But today she felt herself tense up, the memory of the desecration of the foundation of her future with Jamal running over and over in her mind. She glanced at the cleaning supplies on her back seat and glared with determination.</p>
<p>"You know what this is?" Jamal beamed as the realtor took down the 'for sale' sign on the beach house.</p>
<p>"I've been studying this for some time, and I think I can say with confidence that it's a beach house." Elizabeth jokingly replied nudging her husband.</p>
<p>"Yeah it's a beach house, but do you know what it really is?" Jamal left the pause for a moment, he was well practiced in dramatic speeches. "This right here is freedom."</p>
<p>"Finally earning our own money." Elizabeth sighed.</p>
<p>"Honestly, I don't consider this owning our own money. This is our money earning us money, we're not doing anything special in listing a rental property online, then keeping a handyman and cleaner on retainer. But considering what we had to go through to get that money, I'm not going to lose any sleep over it working for us for a while."</p>
<p>"Your mind has wandered again." Elizabeth interrupted, tapping him on the head, an in-joke they had of retuning Jamal's brain like a TV every time his thoughts ran away from him.</p>
<p>"Ah yes, freedom. Every person in our life only saw us as a ticket to get something for them, everything we have, even our identities exists only to enrich somebody undeserving. Now we have a building, bricks and mortar not skin and bone, enriching us. It won't be forever, I'm not planning on sitting in my house doing nothing and accumulating wealth, but with this house, we now have the freedom to figure out what we want out of our lives, not what someone else will pay us to do."</p>
<p>"You want to talk about our future while we unload the van?" Elizabeth suggested.</p>
<p>"We have the rest of our lives to think about the future."</p>
<p>"The rest of your life won't be that long if you don't help me unload this van, you are within drowning distance of the sea." Elizabeth joked.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright. You start on the bed, I'll unload the champagne and glasses. I don't think we'll need anything else tonight." Jamal chuckled.</p>
<p>Every corner she cleaned just threw the video into a more stark contrast in Elizabeth's mind, like the ghost of the porn star was following her around the house. Eventually when she couldn't handle it anymore she threw the mop on the floor in anger and took to the bottle of wine and pack of ramen noodles she had packed for dinner.</p>
<p>The sun set scenically through the French doors as Elizabeth polished off the whole bottle of wine and started on the second.</p>
<p>"It was my talent not theirs." She ranted to herself. "It was my likeness not theirs, this was my fuck palace not theirs. If Jamal was still here I'd fuck him in every room, just like when we first got this place." She took another swig of her bottle and sniffed back her tears.</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed as she fumbled her way towards the light switch, then before she could turn on the lights she had a change of heart. Her cleaning jeans were old and itchy, picked for indifference to staining rather than any practical concerns, she swayed as she pulled them down and clumsily flung them into the kitchen. Her top was a tacky branded t-shirt the network gave her for the 6th season tour, she tossed that to one side as well.</p>
<p>Her cotton briefs and supportive bra had no purpose beyond comfort, her d-cup breasts required support through all the bouncing and swaying that came with vigorous cleaning.</p>
<p>Originally Elizabeth was determined to get out of her uncomfortable cleaning clothes, she had stripped off down to her underwear and released her long black hair from the tight ponytail, but the act of stripping down had taken a life of its own, it has its own sort of momentum, one which drove her to continue. She reached behind her back, and after some fumbling unclipped her bra, letting it drop to her feet and as her breasts jiggled free. She stumbled a bit as she bent over and dropped her cotton knickers down her legs, before tossing them with reckless abandon like she had done for the rest of her clothes.</p>
<p>"Freedom!" Elizabeth said aloud as she stood naked in the dark. She grinned as she strutted around the beach house naked, this was her space, her domain now. She sensuously walked over to her bottle to take another swig and then looked out over her house again. The video that had brought her here once again flashed through her mind, but now instead of revulsion, she giggled with a kind of silly eroticism.</p>
<p>She walked over to the front door, then acted as if she had just walked in, just like the model had done in the movie. She then strutted to the sofa and posed. She spread her legs for an imaginary camera, giggling as she parted her pussy and leered alluringly. She broke character for a moment as she ran to her suitcase to fetch her dildo, a moderate sized black one that had been her only sexual companion since Jamal died. Then she knelt in front of the French windows and began pushing the plastic phallus down her throat.</p>
<p>Elizabeth clearly was not as experienced as the women in the video as she gagged and choked on the dildo, but the woman in the video didn't immediately start playing with her pussy as the dildo went down her throat, so she differed from Elizabeth in a bunch of ways.</p>
<p>Just as Elizabeth felt herself building towards an orgasm she pulled back. She didn't want to imitate the whole video (for starters she was aware going skinny dipping at night while this drunk was definitely a bad idea), but she knew the grand finale took place on the bed. She sauntered over to the bedroom, holding the dildo like it was a penis attached to a man she was dragging to the bedroom. She jumped on the bed, then with as little hesitation or ceremony, plunged the dildo into her vagina.</p>
<p>Elizabeth didn't slow, in her mind a relentless man was now having his was with her, taking her hard because he could. Her hands became a blur as she pounded herself with the dildo, not containing her moans of delight as orgasms wracked her body. She then fell asleep as her arms fell limp to her sides and the dildo flopped out of her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth woke up naked and uncovered as the morning light shone through her room. The moment she was conscious, she panicked and grabbed her duvet, pulling it on to her body.</p>
<p>'Who am I covering my body for?' she thought to herself. Sure if she was sharing the house with someone else, or acting her body would be out of bounds, but she was alone in her beach house, her freedom. She bit her lip as she threw the duvet to one side.</p>
<p>"I don't feel like wearing clothes today." Elizabeth said out loud. Now she had confirmed it to the house she stood up and wandered into the kitchen to get some cereal and some aspirin for the hangover. She sat at the breakfast bar, her bare bottom on the leather seats of the chrome bar stools that matched the kitchen appliances, gazing out of the French windows.</p>
<p>As she could see the public beach, Elizabeth reasoned that there was a long shot that someone on the public beach who happened to look in the right direction may see her. But in early October the tourist season was over, so the beach was usually empty despite the weather remaining quite temperate. She thought about closing the curtains, but then Jamal's voice echoed in her ears, 'this house is freedom.' She didn't want to be seen or want to be not seen, she was just thrilled to not care.</p>
<p>She had her morning shower with the door open, she quickly dried off her body before going and sitting on the sofa with a good book and a towel wrapped around her hair. Once she got a bit bored of that she decided she could spend some time browsing the internet for new holiday homes to buy and add to the empire. At every turn she felt a sort of weightlessness that in this house she didn't have to worry about what anyone else thought of her, she didn't have to constrain her actions based on anyone else's expectations. As she browsed she found herself back on the porn video that had made her so angry before and now found herself laughing at it.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>As dinner rolled around, she decided she didn't need the wine tonight, her head was spinning with euphoria just at the feeling of skirting around the kitchen, frying up a quick stir fry, wearing absolutely nothing. It was a warm evening as she grabbed her plate and saw that beautiful view of the sun going down over the beach outside her french windows.</p>
<p>"It's such a nice evening, I think I'll eat my meal on the deck." Elizabeth announced, wandering over to the French windows and pulling them open, feeling the sea breeze caress her naked body as she wandered outside.</p>
<p>Elizabeth walked down a small flight of stairs to the decking platform they had built slightly away from the house. She sat on a chair that was part of the stylish yet hard wearing patio furniture set and began to eat her dinner. The platform was built as a slice of the house on the beach, it had a BBQ and a chest for beach games, plus was about three steps away from the beach itself. Elizabeth could see the whole white sandy seaside stretching for miles in each direction, and if anyone else decided to spend their evening on the sand, they would see the whole of Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Of course she was nervous at first, in the past, on the rare occasions she went to the beach, everything was stage managed for the paparazzi, now she was sat by the beach, totally naked without those same worries, just alone and happy.</p>
<p>"Freedom." She sighed to herself before tucking into her meal. With each mouthful she felt more relaxed and at ease with herself, the nerves of being outside faded until sitting naked on her deck was another freedom she could enjoy, the empty beach stretching out as if it was only made for her. She picked up her plate and prepared to go inside when she remembered the video and had another idea.</p>
<p>'That thing about swimming after you eat is just a myth right?' She thought to herself as she stood up and descended from the deck onto the beach. Sand compressed between the grip of her toes with every step she took towards the sea, it was late into the sunset so the world was darkening but still not quite night.</p>
<p>Elizabeth let out a squeal as her toe made contact with the cold Pacific Ocean. She jumped back with shock and was surprised at how much she appreciated the feel of her breast bouncing in unrestricted reaction, it was yet another reminder of her exposed state. She gritted her teeth, and knowing that the water always seems cold until you get submerged she pushed forward into the sea.</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt the water pulse and rise up her body as she ventured further into the sea, eventually she let her legs lift away from the sand and floated. Unconnected to anything she closed her eyes and let her head move backwards until her hair floated upwards and her ears were submerged. The only sound she could hear was the swirl of wave after wave against the shore, her eyes closed and her skin slowly numbing to the cold of the water until she felt like a disembodied presence simply floating above her life's worries.</p>
<p>After a moment to meditate on vastness and herself, Elizabeth shook off the allure of disassociation long enough to realise she had slowly drifted and needed to swim back to shore. She started doing a breast stroke and drove herself to distraction feeling her ample breasts weightlessly bob around with each stroke bringer her closer to the beach.</p>
<p>As she left the water, the first breeze immediately revealed the flaw in Elizabeth's spontaneous decision, her towel was still back in the house and the cold water hitting the early evening air practically froze her solid. Elizabeth sprinted back to the house as fast as she could, not out of modesty but a desire for warmth.</p>
<p>After a quick towel dry, Elizabeth wrapped herself in a duvet and mused on her day, reliving every part of it in her mind, riding the euphoria it gave her. She found herself gently stroking her pussy but not engaging in full pleasurable masturbation, just savouring the comforting feel.</p>
<p>Only once in her past had she ridden a high like this, the day her and Jamal held hands outside the studio offices, to announce to the world they were walking away from it all. The feeling of releif that they didn't have to be anyone but themselves was a feeling Elizabeth lost to dispair when Jamal died, in her mind a big part of being herself was being Jamal's wife. This weekend she had once again rediscovered who she was in her own company.</p>
<p>She ran her hand across her pubis, feeling the coarse hair curl around her fingers, she giggled with her latest wicked idea and ran to the shower.</p>
<p>Like a lot of her spur of the moment ideas, Elizabeth hadn't planned or prepared to follow through on her latest whim. Her bush was too thick to be immediately shaved by the razerblade she kept for her legs, so she started off by grabbing some kitchen scissors and roughly trimming as close as she could without risking cutting her pubis. She felt a bit silly as she snipped away at herself, but the silliness gave way to excitement as she moved into the shower, covering her privates with shaving cream and running the razerblade in smooth motions over her outer labia, pubis and thighs.</p>
<p>Intellectually Elizabeth knew this was a small change, it would barely affect her life, but as she looked at herself in the mirror, her pussy now shaved, she couldn't help but feel it made a world of difference. She ran her hand around the area and giggled at its smoothness, the lavicious truth of her unobstructed vagina, allowing Elizabeth to see herself as the sexual being she was never allowed to be while playing the wholesome Bao on Altogether Found. She began to rub lotion on herself, as she would do with any part she shaved, and found a glowing warmth radiating out to the rest of her body every time her hand caressed her now bald pussy.</p>
<p>She didn't stop even after she was certain the lotion had been thoroughly applied, she was enjoying seeing herself in the mirror, caressing and fingering her shaved pussy like a porn star. She didn't hold back from moaning loud and exaggerated just because she could. She got to see her face contort with pleasure as her pussy twitched under her fingers, squirting a stream onto the bathroom floor while she screamed with pleasure.</p>
<p>Elizabeth sat on the toilet to catch her breath, basking in the afterglow of her orgasm for a moment, before picking up a cloth to clean her juices off the tiles.</p>
<p>The next day Elizabeth went into town, a smile on her face as she swum in the new sensation of her shaved womanhood gliding against her knickers with every step she took. She ostensibly had gone to get supplies for a nice meal to celebrate her last night at the beach house and the revelations she had undergone over the weekend. But she found herself drifting into clothes shops, her eyes being caught by any outfit she knew she would never have been allowed to wear out of the house in the past, bags filling up with strapless dresses, fine sundresses, any pair of short shorts that would fit, and any top with a plunging neckline.</p>
<p>As she went into one shop, she saw something in the reduced price section she could not resist, but a deeper more risky idea took ahold. As the tourist season was ending, the shop was selling off it's summer stock, including the bathing costumes unlikely to still be in fashion when the tourists started returning the next year. Amongst the selection was a colourful tie die bikini, with triangle cut halterneck top and high cut thong designed to cover as little as possible while maintaining a veneer of respectability of being a recognisable swimsuit. Elizabeth didn't just buy it, she asked if she could wear it out of the shop.</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt a bit disappointed in herself for slightly chickening out and wearing a translucent sarong around her hip to adjust her look for the high street, but that didn't stop her feeling the excitement well up inside of her as she stepped out into the road and on with her shopping trip. Her ample bust was barely contained behind the small triangles of fabric, while anyone who saw her from behind would clearly be able to make out her bottom. She began to strut down the street, acting unperturbed by the occasional lingering stare as she passed people by. This was a beachside town, people were used to seeing tourists still in their bathing suits, but not this revealing.</p>
<p>She heard a couple of men whispering to each other as she walked past, and caught the words "is that Lizzy Kim?" in their whispers. Once again she felt deflated until she heard the other man respond.</p>
<p>"Nah it can't be, Lizzy Kim would never wear something like that." Elizabeth could have kissed that man, hell she could have invited him back to the beach house to recreate Mike's video, but instead she dipped into another shop to buy a big hat and some sunglasses to try and cobble together a non-descript disguise. This weekend she was not going to be Lizzy Kim for anyone.</p>
<p>Her heart fluttering in her chest, Elizabeth began to strut down the road again, now more confident with a slight disguise. Every errant eye or whispered comment made her feel another burst of euphoria. At one point she got catcalled by a man driving past on a motorcycle and all she could think was to grin at the attention rather than being appalled as she had done so many times before when fans decided to be creeps.</p>
<p>As Elizabeth got further out of town, closer to the small roads only locals knew about with free parking, she saw fewer and fewer people around. As she turned away from a all parade of shops onto a leafy suburban road she actually felt confident enough to remove the sarong and feel the breeze on her barely covered bottom. She glanced both directions on the road and, upon seeing there was nobody, she even put her hand under her bra and popped her breasts out, swinging them as she walked before the sound of a nearby car spooked her enough to drop her shopping bags and quickly push them back in place.</p>
<p>Elizabeth finally got to her car and sat down in the driving seat, grinning with the unfamiliar feel of car seat fabric on her back and bottom as she pulled away, hoping she wouldn't cause any accidents on the way home.</p>
<p>Elizabeth cooked a fancy and complex roast salmon, dancing around the kitchen naked as she experimented with flavours, occasionally catching a glance at her shaved vagina and laughing at the erotic novelty that had yet to wear off.</p>
<p>As she sat at the table, a single candle illuminating her feast, Elizabeth mused on what she should do with her last night in the house of freedom. She was discovering so much about herself she knew she had to keep this journey going but had hit a creative brick wall, she had removed the mental barriers of shame, but she felt there was so much out there she would like to try but was at this point unthinkable for her. She took out her phone, went to the website with her beach house's porn on it, then turned on autoplay and let the algorithm take her on a journey.</p>
<p>Elizabeth's dinner went cold as she went from video to video, looking at what excited her and what she didn't want to do, thrilled that it was her choice what to engage in. She weighed each video against what she had the supplies for, before spotting a fruitful roleplay she had everything she needed to engage in.</p>
<p>The details of the house listing flashed through Elizabeth's memory as she watched the porn star degrade herself in a movie she couldn't take her eyes off of. She remembered the high standards she and Jamal had held themselves to in preparing the house and its subsequent marketing. They provided a high chair and infant toys so they could list it as suitable for young children, they added step free decking pathways around the house so everywhere was suitable for those with mobility problems. But the one thing she now smiled about was everything they had done to satisfy their criteria that the house was suitable for people with pet dogs.</p>
<p>Elizabeth went to the hallway cupboard and opened the section she remembered Jamal unloading into when he returned from the pet store. She rummaged around and smiled as she found the red leather collar with matching leash. She fastened the buckle strap around her neck so it was snug then felt a mixture of a moan and a giggled escape her mouth. She picked out all the fun and embarrassing things she wanted to try and took them back to the dining room.</p>
<p>Her first priority was to do something about the dinner she had left to go cold while she looked at porn. She pulled out a chrome dog bowl and began to serve herself up a selection of leftovers that a dog would eat, also taking the time to fill the matching water bowl with the white wine she had started on. She laid the two bowls out on the laminate floor in the kitchen before getting down on all fours, and shoving her face into her dinner.</p>
<p>Elizabeth could feel her rapid heart beat and the surges of warm blood coursing through her body as she ate like a dog. She imagined her owners eating their dinner at the dining room table, no laughter or judgement at their dog wolfing down table scraps, just an acknowledgement that dogs will eat whatever you put in front of them. She sloppily lapped the wine into her mouth, unperturbed by the chunks of dinner messily falling off her face into the drinks bowl.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was ravenous as she licked the last of the salmon clean from her bowl. The entire time she had been eating, her mind had been rushing ahead with what else her owners would put her through. Naturally after dinner, it would be time to take the dog for an evening walk. She grabbed the leash, clipping one end to her collar while placing the handle in her mouth while walking on all fours towards the French windows, wagging her imaginary tail the whole way.</p>
<p>She opened the door and began to crawl down the decking towards the beach, her breasts swaying underneath her as she descended. As she reached the decking platform, she noticed a pile of driftwood and sticks that she had gathered for guests to start the BBQ with. She gingerly picked out an appropriately sized stick and grabbed it between her teeth, dropping the leash to trail alongside her and laughing at the ridiculousness of her desires as she crawled onto the sand.</p>
<p>Once on the sand she spun around, partially to check the beach for other people, but also to try and think about what to do next. She threw the stick and then ran and chased it, humiliatingly barking as she did so, but when she picked the stick up in her mouth again, it was very sandy and she decided she didn't want to fill her mouth with sand. She tried to think what else dogs do when they are on their walk, and an obvious answer came to her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked around, trying to find the most humiliating location for her to take a piss, the beach was pretty remote, no lampposts or man made structures to piss against except the handful of beach house's that peppered the shore. In the end she simply lifted up her leg and peed on the beach, giggling at her exposure.</p>
<p>Elizabeth returned to the house frustrated, she hadn't planned things well, although pretending to be a dog on the beach was fun, beyond wearing a leash and collar there wasn't much escalation from her skinny dipping the day before. As she trudged into the house she knocked over the bottle of wine she had left awaiting her return.</p>
<p>"Bad dog!" She yelled at herself before grabbing a cloth to clean up the errant drips that had escaped. "And how do we punish a bad dog?"</p>
<p>Elizabeth had a terrible idea, a truly awful one, but once you get an idea like that you can't shake it out of your head. She ran to the hallway cupboard and grabbed the dog bed.</p>
<p>"Bad dogs sleep outside." She announced. She opened the French window and shuddered at what she had agreed to, spending the odd unguarded moment outside was one thing, but sleeping outside would mean almost certain discovery. She walked away from the house, to the BBQ decking and dropped the dog bed next to the steps leading to the beach. Then, she took the leash and threaded it around the handrail on the steps leading to the beach before clipping it to her collar. She then curled up on the dog bed like a dog being punished.</p>
<p>The sea roared in the darkness behind Elizabeth as she began to touch herself with thoughts of what she had agreed to. It was so overtly sexual, the demeaning humiliation, she couldn't bear but love it. The only person who had ever seen her in a sexual way was Jamal, and even then their focus on getting out of the limelight precluded shows of affection anywhere the cameras could see or wearing anything that showed even the smallest amount of skin. Now she was naked and leashed to the decking on the public beach, masturbating and awaiting discovery by anyone who happened to come her way. She stayed up a long time masturbating and screaming her orgasms at the ocean, but eventually sleep took her and gave her a night or erotic dreams.</p>
<p>Elizabeth awoke to something cold and wet prodding at her. She groggily opened her eyes and stared down to see a border collie sniffing her butt. Her first thought was about how appropriate it was that a dog would be sniffing her, her second thought was interrupted by the dog's owner yelling.</p>
<p>"Willow, get away from her." Elizabeth bolted upright, there was a man close-by, this dog's owner. She glanced around in the very early twilight and eventually spotted an elderly man, slightly hunched but not as feeble as he looked. "Are you alright young lady?"</p>
<p>Elizabeth's mind moved fast, he called her young lady, he must have been in his 50s or 60s when Altogether Found came out so he probably doesn't know who she is. He was worried for her rather than horny. He was alone on the beach with his dog so probably nobody else in his life and he didn't immediately reach for his phone, he may not even have a phone. The fog of eroticism still hadn't totally lifted from Elizabeth's mind and this man didn't seem threatening, so she decided the worst thing she could do was tell the truth.</p>
<p>"I'm fine. The truth is I did this to myself as I have recently discovered that I'm turned on by being treated like a dog." Elizabeth shuddered with joy, so much of her life had been carefully crafting every response to every question so as to not upset the press, her producers, or her parents. Being able to tell the unfiltered truth, even though it was humiliating, felt amazing.</p>
<p>"I guess it is a dog's life." The man chuckled, reaching for something to say as his dog continued to sniff at the naked woman. Elizabeth looked into his eyes and had another terrible idea she had to follow through on.</p>
<p>"How would you like a second dog to accompany you on your walk?" She asked, unhooking her leash from the handrail and holding it out to the old man. He gave a polite laugh, then noticed Elizabeth wasn't joking.</p>
<p>"My wife may no longer be with me, but it would still feel wrong to have sex with you." He replied.</p>
<p>"I never said anything about sex, you don't have sex with your dog, you take them for a walk. I want you to take my leash, and treat me the same way you treat Willow here." Elizabeth explained, looking deep into his eyes.</p>
<p>"Alright then, I'm near the end of my walk anyway. What should I call you?" Elizabeth thought this through, she had no problem with telling this guy her name, but she was worried he'd start calling her Lizzy (as dog owners do often shorten their pets names) and that would kill her mood faster than anything. She was considering something like 'bitch' before realising how unsubtle that was. In the end she settled on Sprinkles, it was the name of one of the director's dogs, and most importantly it wasn't a human name.</p>
<p>"Alright, come on then Sprinkles." The old man uncertainly ordered, taking the leash and pulling Elizabeth to his side. Elizabeth began to crawl alongside him, occasionally giggling as he led her further away from the beach house. Every so often she would not keep up with the man's pace and he'd have to pull her to heel, she would stagger on all fours before letting out a bark, she was an actress after all.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>The old man began to veer off towards the edge of the beach and Elizabeth began to feel a delightful panic rising up inside of her. Sure the beach was empty, but he was taking her towards one of the small footpaths. Elizabeth had assumed this man was a fellow beach house owner, if he's taking her off the beach he must live in one of the nearby neighbourhoods of prefab homes for holidayers and retirees. The sand became gravel so Elizabeth stopped walking on her arms and knees and started walking on her hands and feet, thrusting her bottom high in the air. What rational thoughts were left in her mind were telling her to turn back with every step she took, she had been honest with the man so far, there's no reason she couldn't change her mind and call it a day.</p>
<p>What would her parents think? What would the paparazzi think? What would the fans think? Hell what would Mike Hunt think when he opened a newspaper and sees dear sweet Lizzy Kim acting like a bitch in heat? She thought through all the questions and grinned that the answers didn't matter any more, she got to do what she wanted, and despite her trepidation, what she wanted was to be this old man's bitch until the end of the walk.</p>
<p>They came out of the footpath and reached the side of a quiet country road, the old man clipped a leash on his other dog and they crossed to the far side and began to walk along the road. The sun was soon to crest the horizon, which meant it was still dark enough to justify the streetlights being on, shining a spotlight on Elizabeth every fifty metres or so. As she approached a streetlight, Elizabeth remembered a typical early morning bodily function she had yet to do. She tugged on the leash and looked suggestively at the old man as she shuffled towards a lamppost.</p>
<p>"Alright Sprinkles, peeing is fine, but I'm not going to be the one wielding the poop bag if you do anything else." The old man joked as Elizabeth lifted her leg and relaxed her bladder. Elizabeth glanced over her shoulder to see her urine trickling down the lamp post and squealed with humiliation.</p>
<p>"Good girl, come along then." The old man chuckled as Elizabeth shook the last drips out of her. He patted her on the head and she genuinely felt a flash of pride followed by shame that she felt so proud of behaving for the old man.</p>
<p>They continued down the road until the old man took a sudden turn into a small house surrounded by trees. He walked through the side gate and soon Elizabeth found herself in an immaculately maintained back garden.</p>
<p>"Of course, the last thing I do after walking Willow on the beach is hose the salt and sand off of her." The old man announced, fetching a hose and dragging it towards Elizabeth. She held her ground and nodded at him. A beat later she felt cold water hitting her exposed flesh, she screamed with shock before rolling over and letting him turn the hose on her belly.</p>
<p>Eventually the hose was turned off and Elizabeth stood up dripping and ravenous. She danced over to the old man and gave him a kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p>"Thank you for taking me for a walk, I thoroughly enjoyed it.' she admitted. "I'm going to head back now, so this is your last chance, anything I can do for you before I go?"</p>
<p>"All I ask is that you look after yourself, do you want something to cover your body for the walk back?"</p>
<p>"No thanks, there wasn't anybody around on our walk, nobody saw me. I'm hoping the return journey will be different.'</p>
<p>It had been a week since her crazy long weekend and Elizabeth felt far more comfortable with her life. There had been a splash in a gutter tabloid after someone took a picture of her in a sundress that was basically translucent with red underwear visible underneath and she didn't care, she didn't need to care any more.</p>
<p>"I don't get it." The lawyer pleaded over the speakers in Elizabeth's car. "One moment you're fire and brimstone against the porn guy, the next a tabloid is clearly infringing your privacy and you don't bat an eyelid."</p>
<p>"I don't want that to be my life anymore, which includes getting worked up that people I've never met are having the wrong thoughts about me."</p>
<p>"The photo was taken while you were partially still inside your house, private photo taken on private property of someone who wants to be a private entity. It may or may not work out but surely the threat of legal action could prevent it happening again and maybe get you an out of court settlement."</p>
<p>"These things don't make me angry any more." Elizabeth serenely interrupted. "What makes me angry these days is someone who rents a property last minute, then breaks their only key on their first day in the house so I have to immediately drive out to give them a new one."</p>
<p>"Well I can't sue your renters for being annoying so I guess you're on your own for that one." The lawyer replied before going into the polite formalities of ending the call. Elizabeth took a deep breath and relaxed into her drive, opening the window the so the fresh forest air could invigorate her, before closing it again shortly afterwards as it cooled her down.</p>
<p>Despite it being late October, Elizabeth was still circling through the various skimpy and inappropriate outfits she had bought, her excitement generating the warmth needed to counter the lack of insulation. The property she was heading towards was in an isolated area in the woods of North California so she figured it would be warm enough for one of her riskiest outfits. She was wearing hot pink denim short shorts with a tight white tube top clearly designed with someone less busty in mind, and with fabric fine enough that an errant breeze or rain shower would reveal her nipples to anyone nearby.</p>
<p>She pulled up to the forest cabin, the first house she had bought without Jamal, and sighed. It was a long journey just to hand over a key, but at least she'd be letting someone get an up close and personal look at her risky outfit. Her open-toed sandals were unsteady as she walked across the loose stone driveway to the front door. She rang the doorbell and waited with baited breath.</p>
<p>"Alright." A short but buff man grunted as she answered the door.</p>
<p>"I'm the landlady, I have the key here." Elizabeth announced, handing him the spare key.</p>
<p>"Ah thanks, while you're here we've been trying to get the air conditioning working in the living room but the controls are a bit tricky, could you have a look?"</p>
<p>Elizabeth rolled her eyes, the air conditioning wasn't that tricky, but the customer is always right. She walked into the living area and was stunned still and silent at what she saw.</p>
<p>Squatting next to the fireplace were two women, both naked with their legs spread as wide as they could manage. From where Elizabeth was standing she could just about make out the curly pig tails attached to the butt plugs inside the women. Both women had a nose hook attached to their heads, with a headband that had pink pig ears sticking out of their hair. The one on the left had 'pig #1' written across her breasts while the one on the right had 'pig #3' written across her's.</p>
<p>Elizabeth stared for a moment before turning to one side to see Mike holding a camera looking right at her.</p>
<p>"Oh hi Lizzy, we reserved you a spot in our three little pigs video." He explained, clearly running the camera up and down her body feeling like he'd hit the jackpot already.</p>
<p>"Mike." Elizabeth sneered. "I would strongly advise you put that camera down right now."</p>
<p>"Why, you wanna do it offline?" He chuckled.</p>
<p>"I want to talk to you, and believe me you want this talk to happen in private." Elizabeth snarled through clenched teeth.</p>
<p>"Probably some negotiations, don't worry pig number 1, I won't give her your spot." He joked as he put the camera down and followed Elizabeth out of the house into the front garden. "If you're going to yell at me, save your breath..."</p>
<p>"I'm not going to yell at you." Elizabeth reassuringly interrupted. "Instead I'm going to tell you the truth. You'll notice I'm wearing quite a skimpy outfit today, I have also been experimenting with my sexuality. I discovered that degrading situations really turn me on, you can see just by looking at how stiff my nipples are." Mike glanced down at Elizabeth's tube top and was indeed surprised to see two peaks of fabric sticking out.</p>
<p>"The truth is, seeing your videos awakened something in me, something dirty and deviant." Elizabeth explained, leaning closer and closer to Mike in order to whisper seductively at him. "And I would love to be the star of one of your movies, if it wasn't for one small problem."</p>
<p>"Whatever the problem is, I'll do whatever it takes to fix it." Mike spluttered.</p>
<p>"I'm glad to hear that, because the problem is that you are a massive prick. I want you to know that if you hadn't been a gigantic asshole with me at every turn, I'd probably be getting 'pig #2' written across my chest as we speak." She chuckled.</p>
<p>"That's just how people have to be, you can't be dominated by someone who treats you right."</p>
<p>"When a girl agrees to it, yes, but I hadn't, so it was just harassment. Because of that you're just going to have to use your imagination of all the horrible things you could have said and done to me if you had just treated me like a human being when we first met." Elizabeth concluded walking to her car with as much wiggle as she could muster.</p>
<p>"You almost had me." Mike laughed trying to save face. "Lie all you want, I'm not taking down that video of you and I'm certainly going to publish the footage I now have of you in that outfit."</p>
<p>"Go ahead, I don't care." Elizabeth replied, turning back to Mike, then to make her point, she squatted into the same position that his pigs were in, pulling down her tube top to flash her breasts before pulling her nose up with her fingers to give herself a manual equivalent to a nose hook.</p>
<p>"Oh Mike, I want to be a fuck pig so badly." Elizabeth orgasmically moaned, "but I need to be fucked by a man who deserves my filthy pig pussy." She then laughed as she pulled up her top, climbed into her car, and drove away from Mike as he stood there with the look of someone who had just dropped a winning lottery ticket down the drain.</p>
<p>The next video Mike uploaded was not the footage from the forest cabin, instead it was an apology to Elizabeth. She watched it with a smile, then clicked over to a shopping website to buy a nose hook and a pig tail butt plug.</p>
<p>"This'll get you out of the papers." A smooth voice assured over Elizabeth's speakerphone. The only reason Elizabeth had yet to hang up on her former publicist was that shortly after she'd answered her phone, she had handcuffed herself to her bed and the key to the cuffs was in a slowly dissolving ice cube on a necklace she was wearing.</p>
<p>"Remember how I said I don't want to be in the public eye, having someone going around claiming to be my publicist kind of undermines that." She replied, trying to hold her nerve together as the vibrating eggs in her pussy churned with every twitch and squirm.</p>
<p>"I get that you don't want reunions or other roles, but this is a highbrow show that is interested in your perspective on trying to give up being in the public eye."</p>
<p>"That interview will inevitably lead to me attacking people, people who will then defend themselves and attack me, inevitably it's a feud and the whole media circus starts again. I just want to be left alone."</p>
<p>"How's the holiday home business, with house prices the way they are, COVID fallout, and cost of living crisis the vacationers market is shaky, it doesn't hurt to get a rainy day fund going." The relentless publicist prodded, Elizabeth felt herself warming up in anticipation of her sneaky orgasm and was starting to regret her cheeky idea to answer the phone just before putting herself through her bondage predicament.</p>
<p>"How many... how many people have contacted you asking if they could get Lizzy Kim on their show in the past year?" Elizabeth strenuously asked.</p>
<p>"Thirty or forty."</p>
<p>"Alright... I will pay you $500... to send those offers on... to me so I can reply... to them personally." Elizabeth was desperately trying to keep herself from orgasming on the phone.</p>
<p>"I can't have you badmouthing me to the people I want to..."</p>
<p>"I won't say anything bad about you." Elizabeth interrupted. "Just send them over." She was screaming now.</p>
<p>"Are you alright?" The confused publicist asked, now able to hear Elizabeth's heavy breathing over the phone, there was a long pause that he eventually filled. "Alright, $1000 and I'll send them on to you. Now I got someone who actually wants work calling but think about what I said."</p>
<p>The publicist hung up and the moment that Elizabeth confirmed she was alone, she screamed and moaned as the vibrations pushed her body over the precipice.</p>
<p>Once she had finished her shower, Elizabeth checked her email and found the one from her former publicist with a big list of journalists still eager to get the exclusive on Lizzy Kim, each one promising either a sensitive investigation, or a tell-all bombshell depending on what they though Elizabeth would want out of the experience. Elizabeth went through each one in turn and took no small measure of delight informing them that she would under no circumstances be appearing on their show.</p>
<p>Among the trashy tabloids and vacuous talk shows, Elizabeth spotted one invitation that actually intrigued her, it was a podcast called Murdoch's Mothef*ckers. It appeared to be a dirtbag left podcast run by ex shock-jock turned political campaigner Phoenix Fischer, looking at the scandals and moral failings of the right wing media. They had written as they wanted to use Elizabeth's story to demonstrate how sociopathic the media can be in relation to celebrities. They weren't asking for an appearance, just permission to talk about her story. The novelty of such a request was enough for her to give them a thumbs up before going back to blanket rejections.</p>
<p>Jake:...so they justify their harassment by saying the figure is a public figure, then they justify that person's position as a public figure by the viewership of their harassment. It would be like when a kid pulls another kid's pants down in class and when the teacher tries to tell them off the kid says "but look how all the class is pointing and laughing at him, clearly he wants the attention."</p>
<p>Serena: based off a true story?</p>
<p>Jake: yup, it was also a story with a strong moral not to go commando in high school... whoever that kid was.</p>
<p>Phoenix: similar thing happened to me, but nobody was laughing. Mine unfurled like a python.</p>
<p>Serena: really? must have been cold after the podcast awards last year, or was the python sleeping?</p>
<p>Phoenix: and I haven't mixed tequila and ex since. So Jake I believe we actually got something of an exclusive here. Lizzy Kim has given us permission to do something of a deep dive into how she was treated.</p>
<p>Jake: yeah, although she prefers Elizabeth these days.</p>
<p>Phoenix: my bad. What's she been up to?</p>
<p>Jake: well she's been doing whatever she can to not be seen as a public figure any more. Like, her parents signed her up to be a celebrity and the moment she had a choice in the matter, she and her boyfriend noped out of there as fast as they could.</p>
<p>Serena: smart woman.</p>
<p>Phoenix: damn man, I already had a bit of a crush on her growing up, now you're going to tell me she's clever and strong enough to stand up to the press? Throw a mouse down my trousers because the python just woke up.</p>
<p>Serena: so we're adding "the python" to the list of euphemisms for your penis?</p>
<p>Jake: someone on Reddit is actually keeping track of that. According to thekyle25 there are... 35 different nicknames, 36 once "the python" gets on there.</p>
<p>Phoenix: in which case I'm now going to refer to my penis as "thekyle25's list" as it's going to keep getting longer beyond what is funny.</p>
<p>Serena: "thekyle25's list" is going to be on thekyle25's list. I think that's going to break something.</p>
<p>Jake: anyway, back to Elizabeth, she has only had one deliberate media facing appearance since she turned 18 and that was to tell the media to go fuck themselves.</p>
<p>Phoenix: let me guess, the media respected her wishes and went home to rethink their lives?</p>
<p>Jake: the fact that I can make a flipbook of pictures of her looking happier for a year, then sadder as her husband gets sick and dies, and then even more photos of her in mourning suggests that the parasites weren't going to drop their host that easily.</p>
<p>Serena: yeah I found this photo of her a week after her husband's funeral and all The Questioner can talk about is the wind lifting her skirt so you can see her knickers.</p>
<p>Phoenix: isn't that illegal?</p>
<p>Jake: if they had deliberately taken the photo up her skirt it would have been as the law states women wearing a skirt have a reasonable expectation of privacy in regards to their knickers. But when the wind lifted up her skirt, there was no longer an expectation of privacy.</p>
<p>Serena: that is such a shitheel argument.</p>
<p>Jake: that shitheel argument was why when Elizabeth took them to court, she lost.</p>
<p>Phoenix: fucking court system man. Has Elizabeth ever won a court case.</p>
<p>Jake: once, The Pillar gave her a 6 figure payout after one of their photos was judged to have been taken of Elizabeth on private property. It was a photo of her taking off her sweaty top after a session on an exercise bike and the increase in circulation on the magazine has been estimated to be worth far more than the fine.</p>
<p>Phoenix: like I've always said, if the punishment is a fine, for the rich it's not a crime.</p>
<p>Serena: or if you have a wealthy friend willing to pay the fine.</p>
<p>Phoenix: for the last time, if you get arrested for harassing the supreme court justices, I'll pay bail but you're gonna have to start a kickstarter if they fine you.</p>
<p>Elizabeth arrived at the beach house with a skip in her step, she had the place for the whole week, concluding with the podcasters from Murdoch's Motherf*ckers visiting to record an interview with her Sunday morning. She had made a mixture of a plan and a bet with the guys from the podcast, it required Elizabeth to continue with a lot of crazy things she had been doing in the lead up to her trip, things that scared her even more than her worst fantasies.</p>
<p>Phoenix: welcome everyone to the show, I am so excited for today's episode, we're talking to Elizabeth Kim at her beach house in Oregon, how are you doing Elizabeth?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: you know the drill, I'm not answering that.</p>
<p>Phoenix: really, right off the bat? Well I should explain to the audience what is going on then. Elizabeth set us a little challenge to demonstrate the full reach of media intrusion into her life, as well as demonstrating you get a lot more from celebrities if you are nice to them rather than treating them like travelling scandal factories.</p>
<p>Serena: so it's been about four years since Elizabeth told everyone she didn't want to be a public figure any more and she is still watched on every corner. She challenged us to try and figure out everything she has been up to in the past month using only publicly available sources.</p>
<p>Jake: every detail we get right, she will answer one of our questions completely honestly.</p>
<p>Phoenix: and from what I can see, the papers have picked up that she's been acting weirdly and it's hilarious seeing them trying to figure out what's going on with you.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: thanks, I've had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Phoenix: Serena, you have that women's touch, why don't you go first.</p>
<p>Serena: alright, CMX got photos of you picking up a series of packages from the post office. They were more concerned about your low cut top and short skirt, but I could see that you had bought something from a pet store. Are you getting a pet?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: nope.</p>
<p>Phoenix: why would you buy something from a pet store if you don't have a pet?</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Elizabeth: that sounds like a question.</p>
<p>Phoenix: well until you answer it I'm going to imagine the worst possible answer.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: it's probably worse than that.</p>
<p>Serena: oh! This is going to get weird isn't it?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: that's a question.</p>
<p>Jake: fine I'll jump in. Partridge Post posted a whole bunch of photos of you clothes shopping. They were very interested in you going into nightingales sex shop. Did you buy sexy lingerie?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: among other things, yes.</p>
<p>Phoenix: nice one Jake, now we...</p>
<p>Serena: oh my god, are you serious?</p>
<p>Phoenix: for the listeners at home, Elizabeth has just taken off her dress and is now sat in front of us wearing lingerie that she had on underneath it.</p>
<p>Jake: I certainly wasn't expecting to see her in a red lacy number today.</p>
<p>Serena: for those who want more description, she's in a lacy red teddy and garter with briefs and tights.</p>
<p>Phoenix: alright Jake, what's your question?</p>
<p>Jake: ah... yes.</p>
<p>Serena: struggling to concentrate there buddy?</p>
<p>Jake: the childhood crush of at least half of my generation is sat in front of me in lacy red lingerie, I'm surprised I'm able to remember my own name. Right, so, how did being in the spotlight affect your childhood?</p>
<p>Phoenix: you're going to ask her about her childhood right now?</p>
<p>Jake: it was the first question on my sheet.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: it's OK. I'd say that I didn't really have a childhood. In my experience hanging around other child stars, you either become an adult pretty quickly, or you are hideously sheltered from the world. I got the latter. I had 24/7 stage management so that nobody would think I was growing up. So I didn't get to play, I didn't gradually get to develop and buy my own clothes, get up to youthful hijinks. I would steal the occasional kiss with Jamal backstage when nobody was looking but apart from that I was practically Mormon. Not that any of that stopped the press. Major publications had a countdown until I was 18 and they could lust over me with impunity, others didn't even wait for that.</p>
<p>Phoenix: creepy.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: very, the day I turned 18 I had thirty or forty letters offering various sums of money to take my virginity.</p>
<p>Serena: was one of them from Phoenix?</p>
<p>Phoenix: no but based off what I'm looking at I'm willing to write one.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I'll wait by my letterbox.</p>
<p>Jake: so back to my question, you seem to be more comfortable with your sexuality now.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: because I carved myself out some space to discover it on my own, or at least to discover enough that I stopped caring when others started commenting on it. Now if you want any more you for to keep playing the game.</p>
<p>Phoenix: alright my turn. You're going to accuse me of cheating but I promise I knew this before you stripped down to your lingerie. The Pillar spotted you going into a tattoo and piercing parlour, did you get a piercing, say on your nipples.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: you got that because you can see their shape through the lingerie.</p>
<p>Phoenix: no I swear, look at my notepad I was always going to ask.</p>
<p>Jake: it is written halfway down. I think you moved it up the list though.</p>
<p>Phoenix: you really want to sabotage me on this?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: it's fine. You are right. Hey Serena, want to describe these to your listeners.</p>
<p>All: Woah!</p>
<p>Serena: damn, Elizabeth Kim is currently flashing us to show off her piercings. They are chrome bars with some jewellery hanging off them, silver chains with ruby hearts.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: want me to leave them out while you ask your question Phoenix?</p>
<p>Phoenix: your breasts, your choice, but I'm not going to say no.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: you're right, plus I think Jake's rapidly developing aneurysm is enough to convince me.</p>
<p>Phoenix: alright, I'm going to skip past a few of the less interesting questions considering all this. What thing have you done that you can't believe you got away with?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: well it's too soon to say on some of the stuff I did last month, but I did once sleep on the deck over there naked. I woke up when an old man walking his dog spotted me.</p>
<p>Phoenix: damn, if he had his phone on him, he could have sold that photo and bought the whole beach.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I don't think he even has a smartphone, but if he did he was too nice to use it. He was so lovely I even walked him home.</p>
<p>Serena: naked?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: naked, and wearing a dog leash.</p>
<p>Serena: no way, you got to be fucking with us.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: why would I lie about something like that? Especially since I'm sat in front of you with my tits out right now.</p>
<p>Phoenix: well I'm choosing to believe her because I want it to be true.</p>
<p>Serena: very scientific.</p>
<p>Phoenix: your question Serena?</p>
<p>Serena: I'm skipping so many of the innocent guesses now. I'm going to go back to that package from the pet shop. That had something kinky in it right? Like a harness or something for training dogs in it?</p>
<p>Jake: wait... really? That was going too far?</p>
<p>Phoenix: for listeners at home, Elizabeth just walked out, good job there Serena.</p>
<p>Serena: she walked to her room, I think she's gone to get... there we are.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: so this is a shock collar for training dogs.</p>
<p>Phoenix: for listeners she is wearing said collar.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: it has three functions, all currently turned on. There's a microphone in it which will zap me if I raise my voice, there's this remote which will zap me if you press that button.</p>
<p>Serena: thanks.</p>
<p>Phoenix: how come Serena gets the remote?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: because she had the correct guess. Thirdly there's a proximity setting, if I move more than twenty feet away from the remote, it will zap me.</p>
<p>Serena: I'm starting to believe the story with the old man more. So just to check that you made sure to charge the batteries...</p>
<p>Elizabeth: argh... ouch.</p>
<p>Serena: I only pressed it once.</p>
<p>Jake: I think the second zap was for her being too loud. Anyway my turn to guess.</p>
<p>Serena: hang on, I haven't asked her my question yet.</p>
<p>Phoenix: Jake's brain is turning to mush in front of our eyes.</p>
<p>Serena: what was the most disrespectful thing the press did after Jamal died?</p>
<p>Phoenix: talk about a tonal U-turn.</p>
<p>Serena: she chose us for a reason, this is the sort of thing we cover. I have no idea how we strayed into Howard Stern's turf.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I think that's probably my fault. Anyway, after Jamal died the press were ruthless to find pictures of me looking sad. I had been very negative about them so they were clearly feeling vindictive. I think the worst thing was when I was in a shop and I clearly didn't look sad enough for their photographer so they asked me if he was in pain when he died.</p>
<p>Phoenix: fucking hell.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: there were also far too many questions about how long I would wait before moving on, like as I was leaving his funeral.</p>
<p>Phoenix: alright Jake, if you can cobble together the three brain cells still functioning let's hear your guess.</p>
<p>Jake: CMX also put a big scoop in their paper about you visiting a massage parlour. You get a rub down?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: nope! Ouch.</p>
<p>Serena: bit over excited there.</p>
<p>Phoenix: I saw that same scoop, but I think they missed the point, as always. So the place was a spa, they did massages but they also did other beauty services like tanning beds and facials and whatnot. My guess is that you went there and you got yourself waxed.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I think you have somewhat cheated again by my appearance in front of you, but that is correct.</p>
<p>Phoenix: you certainly have a way of... oh dear god.</p>
<p>Serena: dang, we would have believed you. You didn't need to...</p>
<p>Phoenix: Elizabeth just took off the lingerie, she's now sitting in front of us wearing only the collar.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Jake, come have a feel so you can confirm with your listeners that I am smooth.</p>
<p>Serena: Jake looks like he's about to pop.</p>
<p>Jake: I can confirm her leg is smooth.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I didn't say I got my legs waxed, I also got my arms done.</p>
<p>Serena and Phoenix: *uncontrollable laughter*</p>
<p>Elizabeth: and my back.</p>
<p>Jake: yes that is your back.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: and my pubis.</p>
<p>Phoenix: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Jake: yes that is a smooth pubis.</p>
<p>Serena: alright that's enough, bad dog.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: argh!</p>
<p>Phoenix: you think shocking her is going to calm her down.</p>
<p>Serena: I think it will spare us telling the paramedics why Jake's brain dribbled out of his ears.</p>
<p>Phoenix: alright my question. How long have you been going through... well this? Like was it repression bubbling to the surface? Have you always pulled these sorts of things but we're only now hearing about it? I'm just trying to get to grips with this crazy situation.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: this is a recent development. Some guy used this house to shoot a porn movie in, when I found out about it I was mad, but I also watched and researched the video several times, then I re-enacted it, then I started doing my own adventures.</p>
<p>Phoenix: I saw that, the guy has since apologised.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: he only apologised because I told him if he hadn't been a prick about the whole situation, I probably would have been willing to star in his next movie.</p>
<p>Serena: damn that must have hit hard for him.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I'll review later, see if my breasts are as effective as the three ghosts from a Christmas Carol.</p>
<p>Serena: nice. Anyway it's my turn. The Pillar saw you going into a house they speculate was a brothel and leaving with dishevelled hair, you get your freak on?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: no, that was a red herring.</p>
<p>Serena: damn.</p>
<p>Jake: the Daily Post had a frenzy of speculation about you visiting a strip club while it was closed. They speculated that you were organising a private booth but I think you were asking if you could perform one night on the down low.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: another red herring. The guy there had asked me to perform in the past, but he was very sleazy about it so I said no.</p>
<p>Phoenix: if he wanted to see you naked all he had to do was start a podcast about the media.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: actually all he had to do was treat me like a human being.</p>
<p>Phoenix: the bar really that low?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: and yet you were the first to clear it.</p>
<p>Phoenix: bleak. My turn, were there sex toys in the other packages? The ones you picked up while you were picking up your collar.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: sex toys?</p>
<p>Phoenix: like dildos and butt plugs?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: nope.</p>
<p>Serena: we were on a roll before you got naked.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I'm sorry, if you want to shock me as punishment I'd understand.</p>
<p>Serena: well now I'm going to.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: argh!</p>
<p>Serena: I'm just trying to think of what the worst things you could have done were, because you got a look on your face that says there's still things happening. When you went to that piercing parlour, did you also get a tattoo?</p>
<p>Phoenix: if she had a tattoo surely Jake would have... well I'll be a son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Serena: so she had some kind of fake skin covering her lower back.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: bit of special effects trickery I picked up from the hardcore makeup artists they brought in for the weird Halloween specials.</p>
<p>Serena: and underneath it is the rudest tattoo I have ever seen.</p>
<p>Phoenix: it says "sex machine" in big, bold pink letters, flanked either side with dildos.</p>
<p>Serena: you know those don't exactly rub off?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I can get the laser treatment if I ever get bored of it, but I like it, I get to permanently stamp on my body my new identity, and this time it was one I chose rather than one that was chosen for me.</p>
<p>Serena: alright my question is...</p>
<p>Elizabeth: already asked.</p>
<p>Serena: what?</p>
<p>Jake: she's got you there, you said 'you know those don't rub off?' That's a question.</p>
<p>Serena: oh you bitch, just for that...</p>
<p>Elizabeth: argh!</p>
<p>Phoenix: every time you do that she gets more into this. Look at her face.</p>
<p>Serena: alright then, how about we play fetch.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: argh, oh my... fucking hell.</p>
<p>Phoenix: that was mean. Serena just threw the control out of the window so Elizabeth had to run out the door and around the house in broad deadline to stop being shocked.</p>
<p>Serena: oh you know she's enjoying herself. Here she is!</p>
<p>Elizabeth: well I'm giving the control to phoenix then.</p>
<p>Phoenix: thanks, let's see if it still works.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: mmmm... Phoenix, your guess.</p>
<p>Jake: CMX made a thing of you visiting an office building that had a nude photography studio in it. Did you use it?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: nope... argh.</p>
<p>Phoenix: yeah, I'm not like Serena, you're getting punished every time we get it wrong.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: promise?</p>
<p>Phoenix: alright this is starting to drag on, we need some sort of sudden death ruling.</p>
<p>Serena: I know it's a question but just to help us move it along, how many big secrets do you have left?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: there's lots of bits and pieces, but I'd say you are missing two more really big ones.</p>
<p>Phoenix: alright sudden death, we each get a yes or no question to try and work out the two remaining big things, once we've asked a question each and not worked out the answer, you get to choose a punishment for us.</p>
<p>Serena: I feel like we should probably have some boundaries on our punishment, not to kink shame but we're not all sex machines.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: you don't need to be punished, just the shame of not getting it right is punishment enough.</p>
<p>Phoenix: alright then, does it have something to do with the packages?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: the packages had some small things in them but not know if the two big things I'm thinking of.</p>
<p>Serena: is it something else to do with your looks?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: one is.</p>
<p>Jake: what more is there? I really can't see where you could hide anything else from us. Is it covered with makeup?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: nope. Any guesses before I reveal.</p>
<p>Phoenix: I got nothing so you're getting shocked then you can tell us.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: argh! Mmm... so you didn't notice this.</p>
<p>Phoenix: fuck me!</p>
<p>Jake: I was not expecting that.</p>
<p>Serena: so for our listeners, her hair was a wig, she's completely bald underneath.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: sex machines don't have hair.</p>
<p>Phoenix: oh my god, I dread to think what your last thing is.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: well that's the thing, you have three questions then you have to guess.</p>
<p>Phoenix: alright, if it's not your hair, is it something you've done.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: sort of, it's something I have organised to do.</p>
<p>Serena: is it stripping at a different place to the strip club?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: no.</p>
<p>Jake: are you doing a porn movie?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: no. Phoenix could you do me a favour? I need a little electric courage for this reveal, could you give me a zap. Mmm... thank you.</p>
<p>Serena: she's off again, that makes me nervous on her behalf.</p>
<p>Jake: my mind is totally blank to whatever else she could do.</p>
<p>Phoenix: yeah I got nothing.</p>
<p>All...</p>
<p>Serena: she's been gone a while now.</p>
<p>Phoenix: for listeners we'll edit out the long wait but it's been about fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Serena: Jake, go check on her.</p>
<p>Jake: I don't want to spoil the surprise.</p>
<p>Phoenix: alright I'll go have a look, Elizabeth? Are you there? She's gone. The window is open, she must have snuck out.</p>
<p>Jake: maybe she...</p>
<p>Phoenix: hang on, I'm getting a phone call. Hello? Alright, I'll put you on speakerphone.</p>
<p>Unidentified man: hello, so Lizzy Kim asked me to call you.</p>
<p>Phoenix: alright, um... why?</p>
<p>Unidentified man: well she's currently chained herself naked to a toilet.</p>
<p>Jake: what?</p>
<p>Unidentified man: yeah I came here responding to the Craigslist ad for anonymous sex but as I was the first to get here she asked me to call you and ask for you to get the key to the padlock and come unlock her before she gets too violated.</p>
<p>Serena: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Phoenix: alright where's the key?</p>
<p>Unidentified man: she says to check under the stairs in a cupboard on the right hand side.</p>
<p>Jake: I'm on it.</p>
<p>Phoenix: why is she doing this?</p>
<p>Unidentified man: don't know, don't really care.</p>
<p>Jake: I couldn't see a key.</p>
<p>Unidentified man: because there isn't one, the cupboard is where you will find a metal detector. The key is somewhere on the beach.</p>
<p>Phoenix: this is insane.</p>
<p>Phoenix: so we're back at the beach house now, and boy has it been a ride.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: want to tell your viewers what you found when you finally got the key and came to the public toilets?</p>
<p>Serena: we found you, fully dressed, not chained to anything, and laughing your head off.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: it was a lesson, I was demonstrating that anyone can fall prey to prejudice when actions are reported in line with a cultivated world view. I made you guys think I was a sex maniac, so you didn't apply any scepticism when someone you didn't know called you with a hot tip on Lizzy Kim's latest perversion.</p>
<p>Jake: it really should have been a clue that he called you Lizzy.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: absolutely. So replace sex fiend with publicity junkie and you get the situation a lot of these child stars are in, where they have been stewarded from one publicity stunt to another and suddenly people will believe any story, or any interpretation of a story, as long as it fits into their lens of what a public figure is and does.</p>
<p>Phoenix: you make a good point in a very drastic way. You really get a tattoo, your nipples pierced and shave your head just for a dramatic reveal?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: all faked I'm afraid.</p>
<p>Serena: but you did really get naked for us, you can't fake that.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: well that I didn't mind so much, plus it was hilarious to see Jake completely short circuited like that.</p>
<p>Phoenix: well it's certainly going to go down as one of our more memorable episodes, thanks for being an insane human being for us.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: thank you for having me.</p>
<p>The podcasters packed up their stuff and left, gushing about Elizabeth's brave idea. The moment the door had closed behind them, Elizabeth picked up her phone and idly flicked to the photos she had asked the stranger to take of her before making the call. She was sat on the toilet, naked with her hands tied behind her back and around the toilet just like the man had said on the phone, her legs wide open inviting her degradation. She admired her very real nipple piercings, she couldn't see it but there was still a dull ache on her back from the very real tattoo she had gotten, her head smooth from the fresh shave she had given it that morning.</p>
<p>Elizabeth squealed at the thought that she had been able to give the world a tiny taste of the person she had become and then been able to retract that and pretend it was an act. Nobody would know for sure that this is the person she is now.</p>
<p>'nobody except the guy in the public toilet' Elizabeth thought to herself, scrolling ahead to the next picture of her still tied to the toilet but now out of breath with a used condom carelessly discarded onto her body, clinging to her torso as her eyes wildly looked at the camera. The man had not lasted that long inside of her and so she had been desperate to give that itch a full scratch for a while now.</p>
<p>Elizabeth opened up an email and attached the before and after photos of her wild moment, she addressed it to Mike the pornographer with the subject line 'can you keep a secret?' She then grabbed a dildo, a plug, and a leash as she headed towards the decking.</p>
<p>Once she had cleared her mind she decided against sending the pictures to Mike, but she did have another idea.</p>
<p>Mike had two idioms at war in his mind as he stepped into the taxi. The first idiom was that if something seemed too good to be true, it probably was. Something seemed off about a production company greenlighting a documentary about up and coming porn producers. Even more off-putting was the no expense spared treatment he was getting from them. He was given a business class flight from LAX to Portland with a taxi waiting to take him to a log cabin in the forest that lay in the shadow of Mount Hood. Not only was all his travel expenses taken care of, but he was being paid a generous amount and even got to keep the cabin for the weekend after they had completed an interview with him.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>The second idiom playing through his mind was not to look a gift horse in the mouth, it was all pre-paid and pre-booked, they didn't ask for any financial details from him, so he was struggling to see how this could be a scam. Part of him thought it may be a prank, but anyone willing to dole out this amount of cash on a prank would be planning something so big Mike felt he had to at least see what it is.</p>
<p>The log cabin looked as idyllic as it had done in the pictures as Mike stepped out of the taxi. His interviewer was already waiting at the door for him, with a cameraman to film his arrival and follow him up the path.</p>
<p>"Mike, thanks for coming, let's get you miked up and in position shall we?" The interviewer asked. She seemed familiar but Mike could not quite figure out where from. She took him through to two rustic brown leather chairs set up looking over a scenic river valley and Mike took his seat. That chair seemed weird and lumpy, possibly a technique to make him feel uncomfortable during the interview, make him squirm cinematically for the accusations that were about to come.</p>
<p>"So I'm here with Mike Hunt and before we start I have to ask, is that your real name?"</p>
<p>"It is not, no. I kind of regret it these days but it is my brand so there's no way of going back on it." Mike honestly replied.</p>
<p>"So let's talk about your brand, you engage in the more degrading type of sexual encounter." The interviewer prompted. It was not a question but it was clear Mike was supposed to respond to this.</p>
<p>"Yeah, at first that was all ego, I wanted to be the big man and have girls doing anything to please me, but over time it's gotten more subtle than that, some women like the experience and I am a specialist in giving it to them." Mike explained.</p>
<p>"This epiphany of yours, would that be why your videos have become more extreme recently?"</p>
<p>"Pretty much yeah. It used to be I would hire a model and see how far I could push them, real dirtbag stuff. Now I've found if I recruit in fetish clubs and online communities, show them what I have to offer, and set the ground rules ahead of time, yeah the models are not as polished but they go much further which drives viewership up more than the vanilla stuff."</p>
<p>"And this new outlook for you, what part did Elizabeth Kim play in it?" The interviewer enquired, wrong footing Mike a little.</p>
<p>"From what I understand Elizabeth is a private person, she doesn't like to be brought up in these sorts of settings." He deflectedly replied.</p>
<p>"No worries Mike, Elizabeth has already told us her side of the story. How you came to her attention through shooting a movie at one of her properties and were not very nice to her throughout your engagement. She told us that she would have been interested in starring in one of your movies if you hadn't been so unpleasant to her."</p>
<p>"That's the long and short of it, although I'm not sure if she was telling the truth or torturing me. At first I changed my ways in some vain hope that she was truthful, then she would see me being nice and agree to have degrading sex with me, but after a while I saw the results I was getting for my movies just from investing a little understandinh and patience, and I forgot all about trying to trick a celebrity to sleep with me. Jordan Foxx appeared on my channel and got our highest ever viewership, she later told me she only agreed to do the experimental stuff with me because her friends told her how nice I was and what a fun experience that had had. Usually Jordan Foxx only does oiled up muscle girl stuff, but me being nice got a woman who could snap me in two, tied up and calling me master while I paddled her bottom."</p>
<p>"Is it hard changing your ways like that?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely, it was a huge hit to my ego to find out my childhood crush thought I was a prick, but it needed to happen. It still takes some mindfulness to ensure I don't fall back into old patterns, but my work is better and I'm happier as well. There's something nice lingering in my brain that I'm not being a jerk any more, giving women what they want rather than pressing them to do things they can't stand." Mark took a moment to organise his thoughts before looking directly at the camera. "If you're watching this, thanks Elizabeth, by standing up to me you made me a better person."</p>
<p>"You're welcome." Came a strained and muffled reply from beneath Mike. He stood up and looked around confused before the interviewer let out a little giggle.</p>
<p>"I suppose I should move on to the next part of our show then." The interviewer announced. She unzipped the leather coverings on the chair Mike had been sitting on, underneath there was a crude wooden frame, with padding running around the border, however on the place Mike had been sitting, he could clearly see he had been resting on a naked woman, turned upside down and tied into position so he was sitting on her bottom, her legs bent into position to make a backrest.</p>
<p>The cameraman took his position to capture the reveal and the look on Mike's face as the interviewer unclipped some straps and the naked woman unfurled from the chair until she was kneeling at Mike's feet. Mike was stunned silent at the sight of Elizabeth Kim, her eyes ravenously looking him up and down, her head shaved, with rings through her nipples and pierced septum ready to be pulled around by.</p>
<p>"Did I make a comfortable seat, master?" She asked, clearly signaling the real purpose of Mike's excursion. Mike stammered for a moment before remembering how he conducts himself in these situations.</p>
<p>"Not really, I think I'm going to have to tenderise that bottom of yours to make it softer. But before we start, safe words and red lines?"</p>
<p>"Safe word is conclusion, red lines are mentioning that sitcom or referring to me as Lizzy. Your assistant has more information." Elizabeth reported. Mike looked confused and turned around to see the interviewer now stripped down to a leather corset with plenty of chrome buckles and a garter connected to fishnet stockings. She was wearing a tiny black thong as well as leather cuffs and collars. Elizabeth had clearly drawn attention to her too early as she was still putting on her ballet heeled stilettos.</p>
<p>"You still don't remember me do you?" She asked. Mike cocked a quizzical eyebrow. "I had blonde hair..." she gave the pause as Mike's last chance to remember her on his own before finishing the sentence. "...when you filmed our video at Elizabeth's beach house."</p>
<p>Mike slapped his head, it was over a year ago now but that was no excuse for being so absentminded. He apologised to Ginger as she stood up to her full height and loomed over Elizabeth.</p>
<p>"No worry, we'll make plenty of memories this weekend."</p>
<p>"We have the whole weekend?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes, this is the owner's latest holiday home idea, if you rent this house, you get possession of the owner for the entire time you're here. Next door is a walk in cupboard full of toys and equipment for you to use. Plus our cameraman here is paid up for the weekend to record all the action so you don't have to worry about that." Ginger explained. "So what do you want to do first?"</p>
<p>"Well naturally I'll want to check out that walk in closet, but I don't want Elizabeth... you know that names not going to work for me, Bitch Slave! I don't want Bitch Slave here to feel abandoned do I?" Mike explained, he had shaken off his shock long enough to get into the rhythm of his performance and was now teasingly stroking Elizabeth. "Bitch Slave, have you ever eaten pussy before?"</p>
<p>"No master." Elizabeth diligently replied.</p>
<p>"Ginger, sit on Bitch Slave's face while I check out what I'm working with. If she doesn't make you cum by the time I get back there will be punishments" Mike ordered as his assistant diligently got to work.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was not lying when she said she had never eaten pussy, but she was curious about the sensation. She lay down on the ground as watched as Ginger stood over her, quickly moving her thong to one side before crouching down slowly but relentlessly until Elizabeth could feel her thighs comfortably sandwiching her head. She stretched out her tongue as the assistant's pussy descended onto her, then she began messily licking with all her might.</p>
<p>Elizabeth moaned and squirmed as she delved as deeply as she could into the pussy being smushed into her face. She had never known the taste of a women's juices before today and she was eager to drink while she could. Occasionally Ginger would squeeze her breasts or even give her freshly shaved pussy a light slap just to remind her to keep giving her all.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was starting to wonder what was taking Mike so long when she felt Ginger's thighs tighten around her head, Ginger grabbed her breasts and squeezed them so hard it felt like her acrylic nails were going to pierce her flesh, her loud moaning made it clear she was close to orgasm and under no circumstances was Elizabeth to stop.</p>
<p>As Ginger rolled off Elizabeth's moist face, she opened her eyes to see Mike standing there looking at her disapprovingly.</p>
<p>"You know how long I have been stood here waiting for you to make my assistant cum? Eight minutes and fourteen seconds. Believe me you are going to regret that in the future, until then I'm going to leave the prospect of punishment hanging above you like a sword of Damocles." He explained, pulling Elizabeth up to her knees with her sternum piercing. "So for this weekend what are you?"</p>
<p>"A Bitch Slave, master."</p>
<p>"Good, so what do you think I should write across your tits?"</p>
<p>"Bitch Slave, master."</p>
<p>"Right you are again." Mike took the black Sharpie out of the multi-coloured multipack in the walk in closet and watched Elizabeth moaned as the nib caressed her skin, leaving behind its degrading labelling. "You have quite a selection of toys, but I think we'll start with this seeing as it made such an impression during the podcast."</p>
<p>Mike clipped the electroshock collar around Elizabeth's neck and gave the remote a press to check it was working. Elizabeth moaned with painful delight.</p>
<p>"Did those podcasters know that this comes with strength settings? This little dial on the side here that's currently set to one. After all, you wouldn't want to give a chihuahua a shock designed for a St. Bernard would you? So let's see what setting number two feels like." Mike flicked the dial up one notch and pressed the button again, causing Elizabeth to shriek and fall to the ground. "Looking forward to us working our way up to 10 over the weekend?"</p>
<p>"Yes master." Elizabeth growled into the floorboards.</p>
<p>"Great, well let's get you tied up, I feel like breaking you in." Mike announced grabbing a significant length of rope and winding it out between his hands. "Ever since my new way of doing things, I've gotten especially well practiced at shibari, sit up straight, I'm going to make sure this squeezes you in all the right places."</p>
<p>Mike wrapped the rope around Elizabeth in an intricate pattern of loops and knots, occasionally he'd ask Ginger to help him pull something tight or hold a bit of rope while he looped it around. He finished off by looping the rope behind Elizabeth's back and trying her hands together. Elizabeth could feel the rope rubbing against her with every squirm and wiggle she made, if she tried to move her arms at all it would simultaneously choke her just the right amount while also digging itself into her pussy harder.</p>
<p>"Alright Bitch Slave, you look the part, now it's time to fuck you. Don't you worry, this won't be the last time this weekend." Mike handed Ginger a strap on, and while she got to work attaching it to herself he began applying a decent amount of lubricant to a moderately sized buttplug in Elizabeth's collection. He bent Elizabeth over the coffee table by the fireplace and eased the plug into her. Elizabeth had only recently begun experimenting with anal, she found it pleasurable in a painful sort of way so knew what she was letting herself in for when she stocked the closet with an extreme range of anal toys.</p>
<p>Elizabeth couldn't help but uncomfortably wiggle as Mike moved the shibari rope out of the way of her pussy. There was a slight pause as Mike slipped a condom over his penis, then all at once Elizabeth found his helmet pushing aside her labia while Ginger lifted her chin up and eased the strap on into her mouth. Suddenly Elizabeth felt completely filled, and then she felt herself gagging and squirming as Ginger and Mike got into a rhythm fucking her from both ends, each time she gagged the microphone in the collar would pick it up and give her a shock which only made her more excited.</p>
<p>The rope contorted and contracted as she felt herself pulled and pushed between the two shafts impaling her. She could barely catch her heavy breathing as her throat struggled against the rubber phallus assaulting her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth's pussy was already tingling before this began, but now it sung with each thrust of Mike's cock. The man she had spent so much time hating was now deep inside her, using her for his pleasure. She was now his possession by her own choices and actions, one orgasm seemed to blur into another as she spent the entire time in a state of uncomfortable bliss. Eventually she felt Mike surging inside of her before giving her bottom a hearty slap as he flopped out.</p>
<p>Ginger pulled out of her throat and Mike pulled her upright, before taking his used condom and upending it over her head.</p>
<p>"Fresh glazing, how does it feel having my sperm remind you that you shaved off all your hair in order to make a better dehumanised slave?"</p>
<p>"It feels so degrading." Elizabeth pleasurably moaned, sticking out her tongue to catch a trickle of his juices that had fallen down her cheek.</p>
<p>"Well now we need somewhere to put you while I wait to be ready to go again. It's a good thing you provided a nice dog kennel isn't it." Mike explained. Elizabeth had indeed provided a large travel kennel, basically a moderately sized cage with a plastic base on wheels, perfect for keeping a pet human who you didn't want to have any privacy. He wheeled it out but before Elizabeth could get in, he stopped her. Before he would let her in, he gagged her with a red ball gag. Content that she could no longer explain herself to anyone who stopped to talk, he untied Elizabeth's hands from the intricate shibari outfit to allow Elizabeth to crawl into the travel kennel.</p>
<p>Once inside, Elizabeth was ordered to lift her head up, Mike threaded some rope through the bars of the kennel, through Elizabeth's septum piercing, then back out the kennel, tying it off so Elizabeth had to keep her head up. Next he got some more rope and repeated the process with her nipple rings, pulling them tight until her breasts were pointing forward and their weight was partially held on her nipples. Next Mike did something that made Elizabeth moan in delicious fear, he began to wheel the kennel towards the front door.</p>
<p>"Oh sorry, with that gag on I suppose you can't use your safe word. If you want me to stop, hum the Morse code for SOS, I know you know it." This was coming close to crossing a red line as Elizabeth knew the Morse for SOS from an episode of Altogether Found where she got lost in the woods, but as he hadn't specifically mentioned it she didn't get angry, and although being dragged out of the house against her will was scary, she didn't hum SOS.</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt the warm wind of a late spring afternoon hit her as her kennel was dragged outside. The driveway in front of the cabin was smooth concrete as part of Elizabeth's modifications to make the house handicap accessible, so Mike had no trouble wheeling her further and further from the house until she was left at the side of the country road. Mike turned her side on so anyone driving past would see the full extent of her humiliating situation, before using some cardboard packaging he found around the house and a Sharpie to write 'free fuck, enquire within' in big letters before leaving it in front of the kennel.</p>
<p>"Now don't worry, you're padlocked in so nobody can fuck you without first coming and talking to me. Now this looks like a quiet country road, I don't know how long I'll have to leave you here to make sure you get a chance to be fucked. So how about I'll come and get you after five cars have driven by and had a chance to see you in this state." Elizabeth squealed in embarrassment as Mike walked away chuckling, leaving the shock collar remote with the cameraman so the proximity sensor didn't go off the entire time. The cameraman circled around Elizabeth to get a full sense of her situation, before taking up a spot across the road to hopefully get some reaction shots from the cars as they drive by the humiliated slave in a kennel.</p>
<p>Elizabeth's heart did not stop racing as the rustling of trees in the quiet foothills contrasted with her sloppy heavy breathing around the gag. Eventually she heard the telltale sound of a car approaching and braced for her humiliation. A silver Prius zoomed by, it didn't even slow down, the cameraman across the road was able to capture the angry mother directing her kids attention out the other window, while shooting her husband her strongest 'don't you dare look' stare.</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt a shudder wash over her body as the roar of the engine disappeared around the corner. She had barely a moment to catch her breath as she heard another roar approaching. This time it was two cars in quick succession, both full of men on a group hiking holiday. The first slowed to a stop in front of her as everyone clambered over each other to get a look. The car behind didn't know the reason for all the commotion, so honked its horn impatiently. The first car inched forward, far enough to give the occupants of the second car a view of why they had now stopped.</p>
<p>Elizabeth stayed on all fours drinking in her humiliation as the men began yelling and catcalling. Some got out their phones to take pictures and Elizabeth winced at the total loss of personhood she was feeling, she was a degraded roadside attraction to these men. There was some loud discussion about if anyone wanted to take the sign up on its offer, but nobody wanted to be the first to admit to it in front of their friends, and eventually the cars decided to drive on.</p>
<p>It was not long until another car drove by, but this one had a husband and wife in it, and although they slowed down a bit at the spectacle, the wife gave her husband a strong nudge and they moved on quickly.</p>
<p>Elizabeth began to moan with frustration, her ass still had a buttplug in it, but her pussy remained conspicuously unfilled, the humiliation of her situation boiling within her and making her dream that someone would be willing to fuck her. She readjusted herself, mindful of the growing pain in her jaw, her strained nipples, and the dull throbbing in her forearms and shins from being on all fours for so long, while the rope was starting to dig in and chafe a little. This feeling seemed to last an eternity before she once again heard the roar of an approaching engine.</p>
<p>This was not a car though, the motorbike almost went head over heels as the driver slammed on the brakes and pulled over to the side of the road to get a good look at Elizabeth's humiliation. The man stepped off his motorbike, propping it against the side of the road, and removed his helmet as he walked over to the kennel.</p>
<p>"Lovely day for a ride." He quipped. He was younger than Elizabeth was expecting, sweating profusely from the safe thick leathers required to have a fun weekend ride across the countryside. "Is that offer true? If I ask inside do I get to fuck you?" Elizabeth gave the most affirmative moan she could, begging him with her eyes to follow through on this. She didn't care that he was a stranger, she just wanted to be filled right now. To her delight he made a thoughtful grunt as he walked past her towards the house.</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>After a few moments Mike and the motorcyclist returned and before she knew it, Elizabeth was being wheeled away from the road, just to a corner of the front garden that was no longer visible. Mike untied her nipples and nose but did not remove her from the cage, just opting to make sure the violent shaking of her impending fucking wouldn't hurt her.</p>
<p>"So here's the remote, feel free to give her a zap every once in a while if you don't think she's behaving. Where would you like to fuck her?" Mike explained handing him the remote and a condom. Before opening the cage door.</p>
<p>"I told my wife I was going for a quick ride, so no time for anything special I'm afraid." The motorcyclist explained as Elizabeth immediately felt his cock pressing against her pussy. She was so wet that even with the buttplug the man felt barely any resistance as he thrust his cock into her. He began to pound her as the cage rattled around, Mike quickly flicked the small switches on the wheels to stop her rolling away with every thrust, and Elizabeth moaned with delight at finally getting more usage as a sex object.</p>
<p>The man was thrusting inside Elizabeth for a long time, the vibrations of his motorbike had clearly numbed him a little so he certainly got his money's worth. Even so Elizabeth spent the entire time in a swirling orgasmic bliss, every so often convulsing in beautiful pain as the man pressed the shock collar, then screaming as loud as the gag would allow until the man finally came inside her.</p>
<p>The man bid his thanks and made a speedy retreat back to his bike. Mike kneeled next to Elizabeth's face and saw the animalistic lust that still consumed her.</p>
<p>"So I know I said you would be out there until five cars passed, but the thing is that guy was on a motorbike not a car, so you've only been out there for four." He explained, getting the rope out to once again tie Elizabeth's nipple and sternum rings to the side of the cage. As an added bonus, he also took the motorcyclist's used condom and tied it to the sternum ring so the smell of sex could linger under Elizabeth's nose as he wheeled her back to the side of the road.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had stopped thinking in words, her mind was just a swirl of emotions and desires, she grunted and growled from her cage, willing the next car past the corner. She squealed when the quiet sound of rustling forest was interrupted by loud pop music blaring from a car's speakers louder even than the engine. She braced herself as the music got louder and louder, then suddenly cut off.</p>
<p>"Oh my god there's a real woman in there." Squealed a valley girl accent from outside Elizabeth's view. The sound of car doors opening and closing confirmed her fears, the car had stopped and people were getting out.</p>
<p>"No way, what a slut." Came an equally judgemental woman's voice.</p>
<p>What Elizabeth didn't know was that the convertible that had just pulled up next to her, had four friends on their way to a hen do. The weekend was just starting for them and they were in the mood to be rude.</p>
<p>"See that Clarissa, this is what happens if you don't get married by 30." One of the girls joked.</p>
<p>"This is what happens when you're a whore, which I believe is your department Tiffany." The other friend shot back.</p>
<p>"Ladies please, let's not ruin the weekend for Christabel, come on, let's have a group selfie with the slut." Elizabeth could only watch as she saw her degraded situation, reflected back on her with a hen night framing in the camera at the end of a selfie stick.</p>
<p>"This girl's not that ugly, she doesn't have to do this to get a man, she wants to do this." One of the women observed laughing at her.</p>
<p>"She is hot isn't she..." another girl said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Oh my god Tiffany, you are such a lesbian. If you go to 'enquire within' we're leaving you behind. Maybe we'll pick you up on the way back when you're in a cage like hers."</p>
<p>"Don't be gross, I'm just saying she looks familiar." Elizabeth's sexual stupor gave way to deep dread as the cogs turned in Tiffany's mind. "Oh my god, did any of you guys used to watch that show, Altogether Found?"</p>
<p>"No, that show was lame."</p>
<p>"I quite liked it. But this woman, if you imagine her with hair, looks just like Bao." Elizabeth shuddered.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, I see what you mean. It can't be her though."</p>
<p>"CMX says she went off the deep end when her husband died. Maybe her brain broke and she became a slut."</p>
<p>"There's one way to figure this out." One of girls acknowledged, before reaching into the cage and undoing Elizabeth's gag, freeing her mouth. Elizabeth readjusted her aching jaw as the woman knelt in front of her to make eye contact. "Are you Bao from Altogether Found?"</p>
<p>Elizabeth's mind raced, they'd figured her out. She tried to think of a convincing lie, or at least a convincing accent to say 'no' in, but part of her wondered what would be if she said yes. As these thoughts rapidly flicked through her mind, Mike came running out of the house to try and intervene. As he turned on the charm, lying and saying it was simply a lookalike, Elizabeth made her mind up and intervened.</p>
<p>"It's alright Mike, I'm done pretending, consider the red lines dropped. You are right, I played a character called Bao on Altogether Found when I used to be known as Lizzy Kim. Would you like Mike to let me out of my cage so you can have some photographs with a degraded former child star?" Mike obeyed her wishes without waiting for the hen party's approval. Once she had freed herself, Elizabeth removed the shibari outfit (and took the condom off her nose ring) so she was left naked but for the collar and the plug.</p>
<p>"Mike, would you give the bride-to-be the control for my shock collar, just in case I decide to disobey her. Then maybe nip inside and grab the Sharpies so they can decorate me as they see fit?" Elizabeth's requests were without hesitation or weight, almost whimsical, as if she was asking a friend to pass the jam. While Mike went back inside, Elizabeth sauntered up to the group for another selfie, this time standing so they could take in her whole body, although the bride-to-be decided to press the shock button on Elizabeth's collar just before taking the picture to make her make a silly face.</p>
<p>Mike came back with the Sharpies and the hen party immediately got to work turning Elizabeth into a multi-coloured art project dedicated to her deviancy. One decided she just wanted to draw as many cocks as she could on Elizabeth's head and face, another decided to colour in her shaved pussy bright pink so it stood out from the rest of her body. One of the girls got to work writing every catty insult she could think of on any spare inch of skin she could find, her ass was labeled 'flabby', her tits 'saggy', anything that couldn't be insulted instead had a general insult directed at Elizabeth like the word 'whore' on her thighs and 'cocksucker' above her newly pink pussy.</p>
<p>The bride to be got behind her, and started writing a long paragraph on her back, putting in a lot of work to tell a story that Elizabeth couldn't see. It read:</p>
<p>'my name is Lizzy Kim and I am a slut</p>
<p>not some garden variety slut either</p>
<p>I am the sluttiest women who ever lived</p>
<p>I didn't have to become a slut</p>
<p>maybe it's in my DNA</p>
<p>I have money and fame yet all I want is cock</p>
<p>Big cocks, small cocks, any cock will do</p>
<p>I'll even take animal cock I'm such a slut</p>
<p>In my sloppy pussy or fat ass</p>
<p>I don't care</p>
<p>I just want cock'</p>
<p>Once they had finished decorating Elizabeth, the bride brandished the shock remote menacingly as she got something up on her phone.</p>
<p>"Alright Lizzy, you're going to give us a performance now. I'm going to play the Altogether Found theme tune, I want to see you sing and dance to it like a mindless slut." She ordered.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christabel, when did you become a sadist?"</p>
<p>"It's not sadism, she's enjoying herself. Anyway I'm with Tiffany, Altogether Found was a great show and Bao wants to be a stripper for my hen do, isn't that totally awesome?" She explained pressing play on her phone. A jazzy saxophone solo cut through the air heralding the start of the theme tune. Elizabeth had always felt that the theme tune was out of date, a relic of the 90s sitcoms that the writers were desperately trying to thematically recapture. Nevertheless the moment the theme tune began, Elizabeth reactively started to dance.</p>
<p>The theme tune didn't have any specific dance to it, it was a jazzy instrumental over clips of each character to introduce them and the actor playing them, so Elizabeth instead went for a up-beat but overtly sexual dance, thrusting out her chest or her crotch excitedly to the music. She noticed that one of the other women was recording her display but instead of giving her pause, it spurred her on to keep dancing, even approach the bride to grind her degraded body against her.</p>
<p>The theme tune soon grew towards a crescendo and Elizabeth knew how she had to end. The last scene in the opening was all the family coming together under the title, but when Bao came in she comedically fell over. Elizabeth heard the bars signifying the end and ran over to pose for the camera, she descended a lot less dramatically than on the show as she was performing on concrete, but she made sure to fall over with her legs wide open to reveal that their stupid performing clown had a wet pussy from acting the fool for them. The bachelorette party laughed for some time, as Elizabeth sat on the concrete watching then re-watch her dance.</p>
<p>"Alright we better head off then." Christobel announced putting her phone away. She walked over to Elizabeth and pulled her to her feet. "Bye, bitch!" She announced before slapping Elizabeth hard across the face. Behind her Elizabeth saw the other three waiting to say goodbye. One slapped her hard on the ass, one gave her a hug before using her sharp nails to scratch her ass as hard as she could, the last one simply spat in her face.</p>
<p>As the music started up and the car drove away with mocking laughter ringing in Elizabeth's ears, Mike took Elizabeth by the arm.</p>
<p>"So, what is going to..."</p>
<p>"I need you to fuck me right now." Elizabeth interrupted, grabbing Mike and shoving her tongue down his throat. Mike remained calm as right there in the driveway, Elizabeth pulled down his pants and began greedily sucking his cock.</p>
<p>"Alright, let me get a condom."</p>
<p>"I'm on birth control and you always use condoms with your other stars so I trust that you're clean. Fuck me bareback."Elizabeth explained as she rabidly jerked and sucked Mike's penis, desperate to get it hard as quickly as possible. The moment he was stood to attention, Elizabeth leaned over the dog cage, spread her cheeks and eagerly waited.</p>
<p>Mike's cock felt barely any resistance as it slid into Elizabeth's desperate pussy. He immediately began thrusting as hard and fast as he could, while Elizabeth began wailing with delight so loudly it made Mike wonder if the cabin was isolated enough. At one point another car drove by and Mike felt Elizabeth clench at the joyous humiliation of being fucked with an audience.</p>
<p>Mike felt himself about to cum, and fought the urge to pull out, instead pumping his load deep into Elizabeth as she moaned with ecstasy. As he pulled out Elizabeth stood up, and with cum still dripping from her, she gave Mike a kiss on the cheek and looped her arm round his as they headed inside.</p>
<p>Elizabeth barely said anything as she made herself a sandwich, Mike was familiar with strategic breaks to keep his stars from pushing too far too quickly, but they usually took place before the extreme stuff Elizabeth had just done. Mike wondered what else Elizabeth could endure as he started making himself a sandwich.</p>
<p>"So, you're not worried they're going to post that online?" He asked.</p>
<p>"Nope, I've got some instant karma set up for a situation like that. You see I have an alibi ready to go thanks to my podcasting friends, if they go public claiming to have done those things to Lizzy Kim, I deploy the alibi and they lose that thrill, now they've just been mean to a lying porn star. But if they keep those pictures and videos to themselves, then I don't deploy the alibi, and they forever remember the time they got to humiliate a celebrity."</p>
<p>"That's some quite clear thinking while being abused."</p>
<p>"Oh I set up the alibi ahead of time just in case, everything else was just what I was thinking about after you fucked me." Elizabeth explained.</p>
<p>"So are we resting up now?" Ginger asked, taking the nod from Mike as a sign to change back into comfortable clothes for a bit.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'd say give me an hour then we'll start up again." Elizabeth added.</p>
<p>Mike saw the sun beginning to set and had a better idea.</p>
<p>"How about some wine?"</p>
<p>Elizabeth awoke in a haze, she was laying in a dog bed in front of the fireplace, naked but feeling remarkably unmolested, her body feeling comfortable and unharmed, apart from the slight throb of a managed hangover.</p>
<p>"Morning Bitch Slave." Mike announced, thrusting a coffee into Elizabeth's hands while holding out some aspirin. "How much of last night do you remember?"</p>
<p>"I remember wine, and being teased but not pleasured, and you asking me about my deepest desires." Elizabeth recounted.</p>
<p>"Alright, so I'm going to level with you about what happened. I had no idea what I could do to top the humiliation you put yourself through yesterday. So I decided to get you drunk, and have me and Ginger turn you on as much as possible without release. Then, when you could take no more alcohol and teasing, I asked you what you wanted me to do to you today." Mike explained, watching an excited dread creep into Elizabeth. "Don't worry the safe word is still in play, I just thought it would be fun to make you your own worst enemy."</p>
<p>Mike turned on the TV which he had connected the cameraman's laptop to. The video player showed a series of files, all short videos of Elizabeth in her drunken state from the previous night that the cameraman had quickly edited for display. Mike pressed play on the first one.</p>
<p>"Say what you just said again." Mike prompted from behind the camera as Elizabeth downed the rest of her glass.</p>
<p>"I said if you keep giving me wine I'm going to be sleepy tomorrow when it's time to punish me." Elizabeth slurred. "Then you said we have coffee and I said if you really wanted to wake me up you'd spray me with the hose." Mike took Elizabeth's shock collar off and she knew why.</p>
<p>Mike dragged Elizabeth into the front garden where the hose was already unspooled and turned on, the pressure waiting for the nozzle handle to be pushed to release the flow of water. Mike grabbed the hose, took a step back and all of a sudden Elizabeth felt a powerful jet of cold water hitting her exposed flesh. She initially put her hand up to block the water, but Mike ordered her to put her hands by her sides and she immediately obeyed. He started with her head, making her splutter trying to breathe, next her sprayed her breasts, and then he ordered Elizabeth to bend over so he could thoroughly rinse her sex holes out. Elizabeth felt the cold vibrating pressure of the hose get harder and harder against her pussy as Mike got closer to her, until he was actually spraying water into her. He took the nozzle off and thrust the hose inside Elizabeth's pussy, laughing as the pressure grew until the hose was expelled and a small torrent of water followed after it.</p>
<p>Mike did not provide a towel, instead Elizabeth was left to shiver herself dry in the morning sun as Mike brought her back to the cabin to watch the next video. As he pressed play, Elizabeth saw herself with Ginger being heavily petted in front of the fireplace.</p>
<p>"I'm not usually a lesbian, but I'm so happy I invited you in on this, your tits are amazing." She slurred.</p>
<p>"Thanks, they weren't cheap." Ginger giggled in reply.</p>
<p>"Do you think I should get implants?"</p>
<p>"These tits are big and slutty enough as it is." Ginger replied, giving them a squeeze for effect.</p>
<p>"You're so great, I'm sorry it took me so long to make you cum. Hey Mike, you never got round to punishing me for that."</p>
<p>"How would you punish yourself if it was up to you?" Mike replied from behind the camera as Elizabeth took another swig of wine.</p>
<p>"It was 8 minutes and... some seconds too long right? Let's round that up to 9. I would do something unbearable to me for 9 minutes... no, hours... no, days."</p>
<p>"We don't have you for 9 days." Ginger replied, tracing the horrible writing that covered Elizabeth's body.</p>
<p>"That's a shame." Elizabeth splurged, trying to steal a kiss from Ginger that she was agonisingly teasing then refusing. "I'll tell you what, since you seem to like all the Sharpie on me, I promise to go over it in Sharpie every day for 9 days, so I can continue to be your degraded whore even once this is all over."</p>
<p>"That sounds good to me." Ginger replied, sweetly kissing Elizabeth on the lips as the video ended.</p>
<p>"So are you on board to do that?" Mike asked the cold shivering Elizabeth as he turned off the movie.</p>
<p>"Well I promised, didn't I? Also where is Ginger at the moment?"</p>
<p>"Oh she's setting something up for later." Mike crypticly noted before pressing play on the next video. In this new video, she was going down on Ginger, but every time she reached for her own pussy to play with herself, Mike would bat her hand away. Eventually Ginger let out a low moan and pushed Elizabeth away.</p>
<p>"Alright I made her orgasm, can I touch myself now?"</p>
<p>"No, you can't touch yourself at all tonight, I want you coming up with bad ideas for tomorrow."</p>
<p>"You absolute meany." Elizabeth howled in frustration. "I would agree to anything right now. Name your price."</p>
<p>"Well what would you be willing to offer?" Mike replied, stroking Elizabeth's body, forcing a squeal past her lips.</p>
<p>"Oh anything, I've never been fucked in the ass before, how would you like to be the first man to do that?"</p>
<p>"Sounds fun."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, I'll make sure of it. You should put the shock collar on me at its highest setting, then when I squeal with pain as you stretch my anus, you get to feel my muscles dance as the sound setting makes electricity course through my body." Mike turned off the video and grinned at Elizabeth as he held up the shock collar. To his surprise she eagerly snatched it out of his hand and attached it around her neck, flashing him a big grin when she was done.</p>
<p>Mike insisted on testing out the highest level of shock before he got started, just in case she couldn't handle it, but to his surprise she shrieked, then purred with erotic expectation as she turned around and bent over expectantly.</p>
<p>Mike practically emptied the bottle of lube onto his penis, he knew as an anal virgin Elizabeth didn't know what to expect and so it was up to him to make sure he didn't damage her. He pulled her cheeks apart as he delicately but relentlessly pushed his cock into her ass.</p>
<p>Elizabeth moaned softly at first, but as Mike's pubis pressed against Elizabeth's asscheeks, confirming his cock was thrust into her as far as he could manage, she let out a much louder moan. Mike felt Elizabeth's sphincter contract around him as electricity coursed through her body. Mike paused for a moment to let Elizabeth gather her thoughts, but her thoughts were only on one thing.</p>
<p>"Fuck me, please fuck me now." She begged, not caring to drop her voice and delighting in the shocks that followed her begging. Mike took that as his cue to begin thrusting. It was the most unique anal sex Mike had ever been a part of, Elizabeth was screaming with a mix of pleasure and pain while the shock collar's constant electrocution made Elizabeth's muscles give Mike's cock a thorough massage as it plunged in and out of her. As a porn actor he was used to stretching out sex, making it last cinematically long, but this time he came hard and fast as Elizabeth moaned with delight.</p>

<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>Mike had barely finished when Elizabeth turned around and pounced on him, ordering him to play the next video in between rough but sensual kisses. Mike pressed play on the last video.</p>
<p>"You can't see it right now but the forest is beautiful, that's where it should happen, my final humiliation." Elizabeth splurged. "Ginger, honey. Could you give me another slap, those are the best."</p>
<p>Ginger kindly obliged, slapping Elizabeth across the face which only made her more turned on and irrational.</p>
<p>"Yeah, so here's what I was thinking for a finale, you..." suddenly the sound cut out on the video, Elizabeth shot Mike a confused look and received a smug smile in return.</p>
<p>"I thought it would be best to keep this one as a surprise, but I promise you we followed your instructions to the letter." Mike explained as he took out some handcuffs and signaled for Elizabeth to turn around. She sighed with excitement as she felt the metal click around her wrists.</p>
<p>Mike grabbed Elizabeth and led her out to the front garden, her stomach churning at the thought of whatever tailor-made humiliations she had designed herself while drunk and horny the previous night. She had deduced that Mike probably wanted to take her to the clearing she spotted when she first stayed at the cabin. A circular space with logs around the outside and a patch of ashy dirt where nearby holidayers would have bonfires. There was something idyllic about that area, simultaneously isolated but welcoming, it had made quite an impact on Elizabeth.</p>
<p>As she walked into the front garden, she noticed her car now had a length of rope attached to its trailer hitch and Mike had the keys. He pushed Elizabeth into position, then began winding the rope around her breasts, squeezing them from the base so the rope couldn't slip off before trying them tight so it felt like her tits were going to pop. Then she saw what she knew was coming but still dreaded, Mike went to the car and started up the engine.</p>
<p>The car slowly began to pull away, pulling Elizabeth forward with a gasp, she slowly walked as the car pulled out of the driveway and onto the main road. Initially the cameraman opted to follow alongside Elizabeth, taking in the environment and surroundings before rushing ahead to jump into the car's backseat and watch her struggle from there.</p>
<p>As the car pulled onto the main road, it sped up a little, so Elizabeth was somewhere between a walk and a jog, the whole time her breasts beginning to ache with the pressure. Mike was clearly keeping a close eye on her as every time she stumbled or suddenly jerked forward he would slow down and then when she persevered and began to look comfortable he would speed up again. Just as Elizabeth began to feel taken care of, Mike opened the window, the car speaker system was playing the Altogether Found theme tune at full volume, reminding Elizabeth of the red line she once had.</p>
<p>Inevitably at the low speed they were going, another car pulled up behind them. Elizabeth wanted to look around, but whenever she tried she would feel her tits inevitably pulled forward. She heard the car behind her beeping its horn and the sound of cheers and catcalls coming from behind her, whoever they were, they were enjoying the show.</p>
<p>Eventually she saw Mike's car indicating, he turned off the asphalt onto a dirt road and while they were turning Elizabeth got a quick glance of the two men in a muscle car behind her who she had been giving a show. She waved as best as she could with her hands tied behind her back.</p>
<p>Being dragged along a main road was degrading, it was like being the centrepiece of a parade, where everyone could see you. But being dragged down a dirt road deep into a forest was a more sinister form of humiliation. As they left the road further and further behind, Elizabeth imagined being dragged to a secluded spot in the woods to be used and abused for the rest of her life. She vividly pictured newscasters talking about 'the mystery of Lizzy Kim's disappearance' while the local deviants talked about the 24/7 fuck hole tied up in the woods.</p>
<p>Lost in her fantasy, she only just noticed when the car stopped. She looked around and saw a familiar footpath intersecting the dirt road and knew Mike would be taking her to the clearing. Mike got out of the car, untied the rope from the trailer hitch, then roughly pulled Elizabeth along behind him, her tits were not getting any respite just because they were no longer tied to a car.</p>
<p>The footpath snaked and weaved its way through the dense trees, Elizabeth wondered if they would cross paths with anyone but somehow each corner yielded nothing but more path. Then Mike turned the corner that lead to the clearing and that's when Elizabeth saw what Ginger had spent the day setting up.</p>
<p>In the centre of the clearing was a bonfire that had been allowed to rage and had now retreated back to simmering ashes. Above it was her dog cage, only the floor had been removed and straps had been added on the outside. Ginger stood welcoming next to the arrangement wearing the largest strap on Elizabeth had provided.</p>
<p>"Ready to be spitroasted?" She quipped as Mike walked Elizabeth over the arrangement and pushed her into position. He uncuffed her hands, untied her breasts, and even removed the collar. Elizabeth could see through what Mike was doing, the metal of the dog cage was not going to be hot enough to do her damage with the fire died down to embers, but he still wanted Elizabeth to lower herself onto the cage just to be clear that she had chosen this path, to assuage his guilty acknowledgment of latent sadism.</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt the heat radiating off the cage as she maneuvered into position and began to slowly lean forward. First her thighs touched the metal edges and she let out a little shriek at the heat. It was painful but not unbearable, like eating freshly cooked soup and having it splash on you before you've had a chance to blow on it. She leant forward further and gasped as her breasts hit the metal bars and her nipples poked through to get closer to the embers. Finally she relaxed and felt her whole torso collapse onto the hot grate, grilling her body.</p>
<p>Ginger and Mike moved quickly to strap her arms and legs to the sides of the cage as Elizabeth squirmed in the heat. Then Elizabeth looked up to see Mike's cock hovering in front of her face.</p>
<p>'Wait, if I'm going to have Mike's cock in my mouth, then that huge strap on...' Elizabeth was unable to finish her thought as she felt the huge plastic phallus, now lubed up and pressing against her ass. She screamed with pleasurable pain, but as she did Mike stuffed his cock into her mouth.</p>
<p>Every nerve ending in Elizabeth's body was firing with sensation as she felt herself becoming ravaged over an open flame. She felt every drop of sweat from her hot body tingle down, then drip off and sizzle on the embers below. Her body was rolling and shaking with each thrust into her body, she felt impaled, deeply violated, the term spit-roast was certainly warranted as she felt like a piece of meat to be dealt with as her captors wished.</p>
<p>Mike and Ginger had agreed that the fucking should continue until Mike came, but he had orgasmed so many times already this weekend that it was taking longer than usual. Elizabeth gagged and screamed for what seemed like forever over the embers, but at every moment did not stop looking like she was in a state of pure euphoria.</p>
<p>Eventually Mike did cum, he pulled his cock out of Elizabeth's mouth and glazed her with the small amount of semen his balls could conjure. They then untied Elizabeth and took her steaming body off the roast.</p>
<p>"Ginger, give me that dildo, my pussy needs to be filled." Elizabeth ordered. Ginger shrugged, detached it from the strap-on and handed it over. "You guys take everything and go back to the house. I'll meet you there."</p>
<p>Mike and Ginger packed up as Elizabeth climbed back onto the cage, this time on her back as she began to slam the dildo into herself. As Mike walked away her wails of pleasure echoed through the forest.</p>
<p>It was an awkward wait for Mike and Ginger but eventually Elizabeth returned and wordlessly began to get dressed. She paid Ginger and the cameraman and then arranged taxies for them all to get back to the airport. As Ginger and the cameraman took care of some things, Mike decided to have a word.</p>
<p>"So am I going to get the raw footage or are you going to edit it yourself before sending it over?" He asked.</p>
<p>"Umm... neither." Elizabeth replied.</p>
<p>"Wait, I thought we were filming this to go on my channel."</p>
<p>"No, we were filming this for my amusement. Remember how I don't want to be famous?" Elizabeth explained.</p>
<p>"So you were just using me?"</p>
<p>"Would you have said no to this weekend if you knew you wouldn't get to share it?"</p>
<p>"I guess not."</p>
<p>"Then you're learning. Keep it up and I may want to shoot a sequel in the future." Elizabeth teased as she showed Mike to the exit and gestured to the taxi waiting for him. Mike chuckled to himself as he got in.</p>
<p>"Alright how about this." Elizabeth suddenly decided, holding up the taxi. "If the press ever figures out what a pervert I am, and spills the beans. I mean scorched earth, total destruction of my image, damage is done, territory. Then I'll send you the footage and you can put it on your website."</p>
<p>The taxi pulled away and Mike watched Elizabeth walk back into the cabin.</p>
<p>'IN THE ALTOGETHER FOUND'</p>
<p>Elizabeth read and reread the headline, occasionally glancing down at the picture of her on stage, naked, and gyrating around a pole. This was the first snowflake of the avalanche that was forming. The press had of course suspected her of being odd after her podcast appearance but nothing had come of it until she got caught in one of her stunts.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had finally found a strip club with an owner who wasn't sleazy, in fact she was accommodating and discreet. The club bartender however was already being paid by the press to keep an eye out for famous customers, he wasn't expecting a famous person to be on stage but that didn't stop him taking the photo.</p>
<p>At first the press speculated Elizabeth's business wasn't going well and she needed some quick money, but her tax records and expanding portfolio of houses dispelled that belief, so next they latched on to the correct theory, she was a deviant. Now they knew the truth, they were very effective at finding evidence. The man from the public toilets shared his photos, as did the bachelorette party (Elizabeth told the podcasters not to damage their reputation providing her alibi, it was a lost cause at this point.) More and more things were captured by shutterbugs and soon everyone knew about Elizabeth's desires.</p>
<p>So she did what she promised herself she would do, she sat down, poured herself a stuff drink, uploaded a video onto an email addressed to Mike, and got ready to completely destroy her life. Her whole body tingled as she pressed send.</p>
<p>"At least they're not talking about that shitty sitcom" she mumbled to herself, turning her phone to Do Not Disturb before heading to bed.</p>
