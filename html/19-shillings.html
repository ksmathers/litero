<p>Do not cross someone whose title has an adjective in it. That was the humourous rule around the royal court that we all obeyed, but I had no idea how ubiquitous a rule that was until the instigation of recent events. I don't have much call to be in professional attendance with upper aristocracy often, my humble status as research assistant at the Royal Academy of Social Policy meant I was periodically trotted out every time someone wanted to visit to look generous as they donated and endowment or look studious at some introductory lectures. I even once hosted my husband, Viscount Montegue and a couple of his friends as they investigated our work, but this is usually a rarity.</p>
<p>The other unwritten rule was that obviously you do not disagree with or undermine the statutes drafted by our beloved ruler, His Imperial Majesty King Harold IV. But our department has been known to toe that line somewhat. The following series of events are an assumption based on what the rumour mill of my beloved institution was willing to convey to me.</p>
<p>I released a paper I had been working on throughout my studies and beyond, into the strategies of recruitment used by His Majesty's navy in their pursuit of continued naval dominance. I meticulously checked every statute and military order and found no formal endorsement of the process of impressment, the forceful and non-consensual recruitment of naval staff. My paper then railed against this evil, as morally repugnant as it was harmful to our long term interests, providing training for a piratical path away from mendicity for the less upstanding members of our society.</p>
<p>The paper was as brave as it was airtight. I worked out to the penny how much money the navy saved through impressment, then worked out how much money it cost to the treasury through losses to pirates, family members turning to a life of crime after they lost a breadwinner, our poorer areas seeing a similar level of economic starvation as an occupied territory regularly raided by an oppressor. The conclusion was that although impressment saved the navy money, it cost the imperial treasury more than it saved.</p>
<p>The Lord High Admiral of His Majesty's Navy read and took umbrage at my thesis, naturally without a formal order of impressment, he couldn't back up a claim of treasonous dissent to couldn't punish me to full effect, but I had certainly earned myself a nemesis, and last I checked, 'High' was an adjective.</p>
<p>My place as one of the few female members of the Royal Academy only existed in a concurrence of luck, firstly that my grandfather was one of the founding members of what is now seen as a noble and established institution, secondly that my husband, Viscount Montegue, remains an important figure in the king's parliament, and finally that Her Imperial Majesty Queen Isabella makes her approval of feminist decisions very well known to the king, in public and (rumoured to be) in private. So I was certainly not about to be thrown onto the street for doing my job.</p>
<p>Instead it was one passage of my research that The Lord High Admiral latched onto, one throwaway sentence that I gave no thought to that he decided to utilise to get his revenge. I can picture it now, him kneeling at the king's and queen's side, reading aloud from my manuscript.</p>
<p>'The deplorable effect on the area around the docks is clear for all to see. Families split up, women who lose their fathers or husbands, forced by our complicity to turn to prostitution to survive now their key breadwinner has gone. It is difficult to put the damage done by prostitution into shillings and pounds, but there are some approximations we can use...'</p>
<p>He would then turn to the king and look him in the eye and say.</p>
<p>"Your Imperial Majesty, relieving the suffering of your female subjects has been a noble pursuit of yours." Pausing for a moment to allow Isabella to squeeze his hand and reassure him that her bountiful rewards will continue to flow. "We have long sought to investigate the horrifying conditions of your most economically and morally impoverished women, and now we find a member of the Royal Academy with knowledge of their situation, and who will not be tempted to fall to their wiles and become a customer of such a tawdry profession. We can finally really investigate how to limit this disgraceful practice without the risk of scandal or betrayal."</p>
<p>The king would briefly look at his wife to get a nod of approval before issuing the order that now sits on my desk.</p>
<p>'Viscountess Melody of Montague. We read your most recent paper with great interest and enthusiasm. We are thoroughly impressed by your studious dedication to the prosperous wellbeing of the citizenry of our dominion. We have long wished for a piece of research to be completed, but until now have not had the pleasure to know of someone of suitable professional and moral character to be granted this position of supreme trust. It is our great delight to inform you that we now feel you meet the high standards such research requires and will be rewarded heavily if you turn your wisdom to such a problem.'</p>
<p>'We give you leave and resources necessary to study the women of this land, forced, whether by circumstance or under duress, into the most disreputable of professions, that of trading away their chaste nature for economic compensation. Please present to us at your earliest convenience, what we can grant you to allow a thorough, hands on investigation of the fallen women of this kingdom.'</p>
<p>The letter ended with an R scrawled in quill ink, the shorthand for 'Rex' as the king didn't have the time or wrist strength to be signing every letter with his full paragraph length name filled with titles and honourifics. Underneath which there was the royal seal pressed into red wax.</p>
<p>"I have to dedicate months of my life to learning about whores." I sighed to my husband as he too stood in shock at the king's order. I tried to overcome the revulsion in order to think through my grant request and how to placate my husband that this wouldn't affect his standing at court.</p>
<p>I stood at the dock, my attache filled with clean parchment and quills. I was flanked either side by military officers, as I had no intention of venturing anywhere near the underbelly of society without an imposing physical presence to deter the criminally minded. I was ready to start my studies and make the best of a bad situation. I was going to talk to so many women and learn so much.</p>
<p>On the first day I had to admit I had achieved nothing but looking like a damned fool. The very people I was meant to be learning about shrunk in my presence, so I could only ask probing questions to cagey local people who wanted nothing to do with the scandalous world around them. This was fruitless.</p>
<p>The next day I chose a new part of cheapside and hoped that my prospects would be better if I asked my escorts to dress inconspicuously and stand further back. I even lowered myself to wearing a more common dress so as to blend in. This had the desired effect but too much so in the opposite direction, I was judged with complete irreverence, on many occasions my military escorts had to step in to prevent me being robbed, molested, or in one case (an act of complete irony) impressed into prostitution.</p>
<p>I clearly needed a new strategy, and had an idea when in passing one of the citizens revealed his military background with an overly familiar (and drastically uncouth) greeting to one of my naval escorts.</p>
<p>"What I am proposing is of course indelicate, but I can promise you a handsome reward and complete anonymity." I asserted with a discomfort that repetition had not yet purged from me. Sat in front of me was the seventh naval private I had asked to make introductions on my behalf, the lower ranks well known to frequent the ladies of the night. "So if you could bring a prostitute here for me to talk to, then I would be most grateful."</p>
<p>"I bet all my mates 'ave said no so far?" The brash young man guessed with infuriating accuracy. "That's coz you're asking for the wrong thing. Every whore in every port has some bad man keepin' her on a leash. Every sailor in every port knows you run things by them or you're not makin' it back onto the ship. What you need is an introduction to the pimp and if you get the right one in a good mood with a heavy enough purse, then maybe he'll let you chat to his girls."</p>
<p>"Well that sounds positively ghastly." I reacted.</p>
<p>"You ain't researching rainbows or kittens here, ghastly's what you're gonna find. So... can I get a share of that 'andsome reward if I find the kinda guy you need to talk to?" He posed. I felt faint agreeing to his assessment of the situation and decided to dress up my agreement in formality.</p>
<p>"Private Wayne Cosgrove, if you arrange this meeting, I will indeed give you more than adequate compensation." I announced.</p>
<p>"Alright moneybags, I'll find ya something good."</p>
<p>I don't know how regular people tell all these public houses apart, we seemed to snake through dozens of them, all identical, before Private Cosgrove lead me to the the right one, the one where the meeting was to take place. If the two military officers accompanying me were nervous, they didn't show it. I however was shaking like a leaf as we ventured through the entryway, past the bar, and into a back room that my contact had secured for the purpose.</p>
<p>Sitting behind a modest dining table was a singular large man. When I say large, I mean it in every sense of the word. The room looked smaller for having him in it and he comfortably grinned even though he had no guards or backup to speak. He was in control of the situation and he knew it. I had been told locals knew him as Tallboy, I didn't know he was just as wide.</p>
<p>"Fuck me Wayne, I thought I'd humour whatever prank or scam you were pulling but no kidding this is some kind of nobility here." He announced, not feeling the need to indulge in formalities even with someone from the aristocracy. "So is it true you want to learn about my whores?"</p>
<p>"Oh, um, yes. In a way." I stammered, unprepared for his question. "I am charged by the royal commission to learn about the conditions modern women find themselves in, including those who work for you."</p>
<p>"Alright Wayne, you've done your bit, piss off." He interrupted, I quickly managed to tuck a coin purse in Wayne's pocket on his way out of the door by way of fulfilling my promise of a finder's fee. "Alright then, I'll do it. We both know Wayne's going to be giving that coin purse to a selection of my girls, so I'll know what's in it and my fee will be ten times its contents."</p>
<p>"Very well." I replied, happy to have the deal done and hoping to get out of this ogre's presence as quickly as possible. "I will make a room available at the royal academy and you are to bring the women there so I can ask them questions."</p>
<p>"Honey, I'm not usually one to tell people how to do their job, but you're not going to learn much doing that. They'll give you plenty of good tips to pleasure the Viscount, but you're not going to learn how the business works, what we did to hire them, and how we use them, that you can only get from me." He explained. Every fibre of my being didn't want to agree with Tallboy, but it seemed like I was being offered insight that would certainly advance my paper. If I wanted to put a financial figure on the burden of prostitution, the man who kept the books would certainly be a good time investment. I grabbed some parchment and began preparing the quill.</p>
<p>"Alright then, let's start at the beginning, how do you..."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to interrupt, but I only have the room for the hour, I don't think an interview will do it. I propose you shadow me for a week and I'll let you go over everything, you can even interview some whores along the way to get all the angles." Tallboy's proposition was intriguing, it certainly would provide some extra-ordinary content.</p>
<p>"Very well, where and when should we begin?"</p>
<p>"I hope you're using the royal we, I'm not dragging two of your goons everywhere I go, they'll be bad for business." He asserted.</p>
<p>"Out of the question. I'm not going to put myself in such a dangerous situation." I demanded, putting my foot down.</p>
<p>"Don't get your petticoat in a twist. I will keep you safe." He tried to reassure.</p>
<p>"I've already had one man try to impress me into this degrading life and these two men are the only reason he was unsuccessful." I explained.</p>
<p>"Alright, for starters forcing girls to work for you is a rookie move. It only takes one military sort with a sympathetic ear and soon him and his mates are kicking down your door with bayonets affixed. Secondly, two military men can testify that you're going to be with me for the week. If I took advantage of you against your will, my dick wouldn't even be dry before my neck was in a hangman's noose. If anything else bad happens to you, my life expectancy will drop equally fantastically. So you can bet I will utilise my extensive resources to protect you like my life depended on it." He explained.</p>
<p>I didn't like this man, he seemed too smooth for the roughness implied by his size and way of life. I tried to find some loophole or way he was wrong, but I had to admit no matter how much resources he had, he would not be able to escape the storm that would come down upon him if I was not returned safe and sound.</p>
<p>"Very well, I will present myself first thing Monday to begin learning from you." I sighed, batting away the objections of my guardsmen.</p>
<p>"Ain't nothing gonna be happening Monday morning, come here Monday afternoon ready for an all-nighter."</p>
<p>On monday afternoon, the streets of the slums were saturated with drizzle, the wet weather barely making a dent in the generations of caked on filth that lined the streets. Tallboy had given me the address of his base of operations, a building as large and intimidating to the surrounding properties as he himself had been in that room, eclipsed only by a nearby church steeple, and even then, only just.</p>
<p>"Welcome to my place of business, I would ask how your journey was, but I know it was smooth as I made sure of it." He explained, taking me by the arm and leading me deeper into his den of depravity. "So the basement is a bar and casino, not sanctioned or regulated of course. Even though it makes a pretty penny, it's main job is to get people into the mood to spend big on entertainment, the alcohol lowering inhibitions and the cards getting pulses racing, if one of my whores isn't on the street drumming up business, she's down there giving the high rollers something to spend their money on."</p>
<p>He led me up the stairs passing by several floors.</p>
<p>"Each of these floors is lined with rooms for use with the Johns, each with a water closet at the end to keep things clean. We actually have a pipeline to the docks so the whore piss and shit isn't stinking up the building and near constant trips to the nearby well pump to fetch cleaning water. Now let me show you the most valuable asset in this building."</p>
<p>Tallboy kept leading me higher and higher, despite his course language, he was at least decent enough to lead the way to assuage any fears that he would try to look up my dress. Eventually I reached the top of a lighthouse like tower, only instead of the requisite bulb, there was a man sat on a chair, staring at the horizon through binoculars.</p>
<p>"This is Ernie, and I would bet that his knowledge of the ships of the Royal Navy would rival that of its most decorated admirals. From this vantage point he can see any and all ships coming in and I can adjust my business plans accordingly. How's it going Ernie?"</p>
<p>"Couple of merchant clippers on the horizon, no need for added measures." He reported.</p>
<p>"So all my girls live in the building, but day to day there's only about half to three quarters out on the game. However if something big crests the horizon, I can cancel the girl's days off at the drop of a hat. Your small timers may be at capacity every day, only I can scale up with demand." Tallboy explained</p>
<p>"When does Ernie take a break?" I asked, my voice dripping with concern for the help.</p>
<p>"Nightfall, he can't see much on the ocean when the sun is down. I tell you in the winter Ernie has the cushiest job in the kingdom. Sometimes he conjures up old navy friends to cover shifts when he has stuff to take care of, but none are quite as good as him. He can tell to the soul how many men are stepping off at port just by looking at the ships, he can even read the semaphore they send out to the dockhands telling them how long they are planning to make port."</p>
<p>"And I assume he is adequately compensated?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Second highest paid in the building besides yours truly." Tallboy informed.</p>
<p>Tallboy led me back downstairs and as we descended I saw something I really should have been more prepared for, a prostitute, a real life working girl in the flesh. I stood with my mouth agape at the presence ahead of me. To call what she was wearing a dress would be akin to calling a castle a stronghold after it had just been invaded and set on fire. It was a formal enough dress, fancier than the common coverings you would spot in the street, but the bust was cut so low I could practically see the poor woman's nipples. Her skirt was of a fabulous length at the back and sides, but at the front it was cut much shorter so the poor woman's thighs were on show as were the base of her bloomers. She had all the trappings of formality, but all the sultry alterations to leave all in no doubt that her body was for sale.</p>
<p>We let the poor woman walk in front with an air of professional responsibility as we followed her to the seedy basement. No sooner had the door opened then I was hit with a blast of tobacco smoke and flurry of vibrant noise. Boisterous men sang drinking songs, while others cheered and gasped with the fickle charms of lady luck. All the while, women circulated; sitting on laps, fetching drinks, ingratiating themselves with the good times that were flowing.</p>
<p>"Would you like to grab yourself a drink?" Tallboy asked me.</p>
<p>"No thank you, I am not here for recreation, I'm here for professional observation." I curtly replied, hoping my stern voice would hide my awe at such raw hedonism on display. I lost track of time just sitting in the corner observing the dance of depravity before me.</p>
<p>"So if you want to talk to one of my girls, it's a quiet night so I don't mind you taking some of the spares to have a chat. How about Ivy over there" Tallboy told me, breaking me out of my stupor. I looked around to the woman he pointed out, a tall, older woman, who seemed currently unbothered. I asked her if we could have a chat. She looked at Tallboy who gave her a subtle nod to suggest she wouldn't get in trouble for indulging my curiosity instead of servicing Johns.</p>
<p>As we stepped out of the basement to get some quiet to conduct an interview, we stepped into a whole different world of depravity. The walls of the building were clearly very thin, and echoing throughout the halls were the sounds of ubiquitous passionate lovemaking. I could hear every bump, every moan, every wail. I could hear screams with no sense of whether they were from pain or pleasure. Occasionally I would make out a voice yelling 'take my cock you dirty whore!' or even 'yeah, fuck me harder' from the working girl.</p>
<p>It was some time before I realised I was stood in a stupor, my supposed interviewee looking at me with confused expectation.</p>
<p>"Is it always this loud?" I squeaked.</p>
<p>"Oh that, you get used to it. During AHOD I had a nap in the same room as a man ploughing my friend." Ivy noted as if such an indelicate sentence were normal to grace the mouth of a young woman.</p>
<p>"What's AHOD?" I asked by way of a follow up question, my attention still not entirely drawn from the beastly sounds of violation that filled the air.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>"Stands for all hands on deck. It's just the times when a fleet comes in and we all work our socks off for a few days. Happens every couple of months." She explained. There was a pointed break in the conversation punctuated by endless smut, and at one point a man and a working girl pushed past us holding hands and eager to join the cacophony.</p>
<p>"So what do you do around here?" I asked. The woman looked at me like I had just asked her what colour the sky was. Clearly she has sex with men, on other nights it would be her bedsprings and moans of ecstacy drilling into my brain. "Let me rephrase that, what are the best and worst parts of what you do?"</p>
<p>Ivy was lost in thought for a moment, a thought I hoped would conclude quickly as the heavy silence once again left me nothing to focus on but the raucous lovemaking filling the air, the walls echoing with the shouted order of 'suck it clean you dirty fuck pig!'</p>
<p>"I guess the worst part is if Tallboy calls you in for a valuation. Every so often he wants to re-evaluate how much you should charge, so he'll have you in his office, obeying a variety of instructions while he feeds back every flaw and weakness you have before putting an exact monetary figure on you. It makes you feel like livestock with a risk that you will be getting a pay cut at the end of it." Ivy explained.</p>
<p>While I was shocked at the practice, the social scientist in me was intrigued, in my world value was assigned through the cumulation of subtle rumours, things you had done to please or displease the court subjectively built up. I'd love the whole game of bluff and bluster to be replaced with a single uncomfortable session where you're given your worth and could conduct your courtly activities accordingly. More pertinent to my studies, each girl having a set value made quantifying the economic impact of prostitution so much easier. I made a mental note to ask Tallboy for each woman's valuation so I could work out totals and averages of money flowing through the business.</p>
<p>"Best part," Ivy interrupted, "it's got to be the girls. We're all in the same boat, we all have stories, we all live together and we all have each other's backs. Before I worked for Tallboy I was in back alleys, pretty much on my own, so many hairy and terrifying moments, followed by isolation, pain, and sadness."</p>
<p>"Doesn't Tallboy keep you safe?" I asked, trying to guide the conversation.</p>
<p>"In a way. He cares about getting money from his investments, so someone roughing us up will usually have a meeting arranged with one of his goons to aggressively gather compensation for lost business. So locals and regulars won't lay hands, but with the sailors you need to move fast so they aren't back on the boat before the meeting can occur. So if any girl gives the secret knock, we lock down the floor until we can point out the culprit to one of the heavies. So I trust my girls more than Tallboy, but at least with Tallboy our interests align."</p>
<p>I struggled to hide my deep envy, I was sure I did not have the moral incertitude to pay the price needed for this camaraderie, but I could count on one finger the people looking out for me in a similar fashion. My colleagues resent a woman intruding in their phallocentric academia, while everyone in the royal court is looking to curry favour at the expense of anyone else in proximity. All I can count on is my husband, but with status muddying the waters of motivations, I had to wonder if I would have such a link of mutual trust if I threatened his place in high society.</p>
<p>'It would certainly threaten his place in high society for me to get a valuation with Tallboy, especially if I didn't fetch at least five pounds.' I thought to myself, before giggling at the thought, then collapsing inwards on my shame. The sound of all this smut echoing in my ears must be getting to me.</p>
<p>"So if you had a chance to escape this life, to become a farm worker or housewife, would you take it?" I asked. Ivy stood lost in thought for a moment, but just as she was about to answer Tallboy emerged from the basement.</p>
<p>"Sorry to interrupt but Ivy, I have one of your regulars here for you, Garth." Tallboy announced. Ivy gave me a sheepish nod.</p>
<p>"Garth is a good man, if all my customers were like him, the answer to your question would be yes without hesitation." Ivy chirped as she descended into the cellar, leaving me alone with Tallboy and the familiar wails of pleasure seeping out of the walls.</p>
<p>"Mr. Tallboy, why did you accept my offer?" I asked in all sincerity but predominantly to dispel the sense of awkwardness only affecting me.</p>
<p>"You paid me." He replied with a smirk.</p>
<p>"A fraction of what you make in a single night to pass information about your business on to the king himself. Does that seem like a good trade to you?" I observed.</p>
<p>"Well what do you know, you're not as out of touch as I first thought. There's 2 reasons I accepted your request. Firstly my business is always changing, adapting to have edge over law enforcement. Here I saw an opportunity to run you through business as usual so when the lawmen start reading your paper, every back alley pimp that hasn't moved on will be behind bars while their customers look to my adapted and booming business for entertainment." He explained.</p>
<p>"Pre-adjustment, plenty of legitimate enterprises run by someone with the king's ear do the exact same thing. Clever. And the second reason?"</p>
<p>"Because your obvious discomfort is hilarious." He chuckled as he led me back down into the basement.</p>
<p>As I arrived into the basement, Ivy was arm in arm with an unremarkable man, walking him over to me with an unnerving mixture of levity and focus.</p>
<p>"This is the girl I was talking about, big fancy lady from the royal court come to learn how us honest ladies live." She announced to a torrent of laughter only capable of being conjured up by a man wishing to sleep with a lady.</p>
<p>"You learning a lot from our Ivy?" Garth added, without taking his adoring eyes off the woman of the night.</p>
<p>"Plenty." I curtly replied, the subsequent laughter confirming it was not only Tallboy who found my discomfort humourous.</p>
<p>"If you really wanted to learn from Ivy, you'd come back to her room with us and watch her do what she does best." Garth laughed as he ran his hand down Ivy's back and with an astounding lack of subtlety grabbed her bottom.</p>
<p>"If it's OK with Ivy." I replied, shocking all the chortling faces into silence, although that shock was certainly matched within myself. It then filled me with a deep sense of gratification that I was able to rub that smug look of social schadenfreude off their faces, even if the consequences of such a daring social gambit loomed large in front of me.</p>
<p>"Alright then." Ivy agreed, "no extra charge, I will let princess professor here sit in the corner and watch me give you more pleasure on one night than she has given the lifetime of protestant missionary sex she shared with her husband." Ivy agreed with a smirk. There were people watching this agreement, including Tallboy, I couldn't back down now, I would expose my cowardice and lose their respect, it would hobble my study before it began.</p>
<p>"Very well, lead the way." I squeaked, utterly failing to keep my voice level and in control.</p>
<p>As we climbed the stairs out of the basement, the lewd concerto once again filled my ears, just to add to my discomfort Garth decided to lift Ivy's skirt. From my vantage point below them on the stairs, I was able to see her most indelicate areas, confirming with mind-blowing clarity that she had not been wearing bloomers throughout all our interactions.</p>
<p>As we ascended the stairs, the noise of sexual Congress surrounded and enveloped me, by the time we were in Ivy's room, the sound of degradation was not simply a loud but directioned impulse like the orchestra at a concert, it was now a all consuming presence, like sailing in the midst of a storm.</p>
<p>The door closed and immediately the lovers embraced while I took a seat on a nearby, unoccupied bed. Their embrace was to spur on their passions, but also to press their bodies together as their furious hands got to work stripping off any and all coverings caught in the frantic whirlwind of lust.</p>
<p>Ivy was clearly the more experienced and had Garth completely naked while he was still loosening her corsetry. Her hand rubbing against his stiff member (larger than my husband's but not by a significant amount) as he loosened her bodice and allowed her dress to fall to the floor. He then practically ripped off the wispy petticoat that accounted for the entirety of Ivy's underclothes. The moment she was disrobed, Ivy did not waste time plastering kiss after kiss on Garth's body as she slowly lowered herself onto her knees to take his member into her mouth.</p>
<p>I had once tried oral sex with my husband, we had both agreed it was too unseemly to form part of our regular lovemaking routine, but to watch it being performed so expertly in such squalid conditions, I couldn't help but admire that unseemliness. Ivy had figuratively and literally lowered herself, but in doing so she had shown her rare and unique skill, taking charge of the room from beneath him.</p>
<p>Suddenly and without warning, Garth pushed Ivy backwards onto the bed and like a man possessed jumped on top of her. He manoeuvred into position, then suddenly pulled away.</p>
<p>"Don't tease me Garth, give me that big cock of yours." Ivy salaciously begged.</p>
<p>"Absolutely, just as soon as you rotate around a bit so I can see the look on our little bookworm's face as I make a woman out of you." Garth ordered. I chuckled with a mixture of nerves and politeness, but he was dead serious as Ivy shuffled into position.</p>
<p>It was far more intense than I was anticipating, watching Garth look me dead on the eyes as he mounted Ivy. She moaned with pleasure as his cock slid into her, then after a moment's pause he started thrusting with relentless power. He seemed to take great delight in observing my wandering eyes as they traced Ivy's bouncing breasts, down to the blur of colliding flesh where their nethers met then up his body. I blushed, if I had shared their state of undress I'm sure they would have been able to observe the full extent of such an all consuming blush, my body was radiating heat from my destruction of a deliberate ignorance born of bashfulness.</p>
<p>"Make sure to take notes." Garth announced as he pulled himself out of Ivy and shuffled himself up her body, his hand now providing the vigorous stimulation previously delivered by Ivy's womanhood. He was looking me dead in the eyes as his ejaculate sprung forth from his penis and splashed itself upon Ivy's cleavage and face.</p>
<p>Garth chuckled as he redressed. He pulled a handful of shillings out of his pocket and left them on a small nightstand next to the bed (probably only there for this purpose) before leaving Ivy behind, she had not deigned to move from where he had left her even to wipe away his seed. The moment the door closed she perked up again.</p>
<p>"Does his seminal fluid clinging to his body not bother you?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Quite the opposite, if it's on me then it isn't in me. That's why Garth is a favourite client of mine." Ivy explained as she grabbed a hideous looking rag from the corner of the room to wipe herself off.</p>
<p>"So how does that work, the whole pregnancy issue? Presumably every client is not as conscientious as Garth." I continued to question just to take my mind off the freshly violated woman casually cleaning the mess off her naked body in front of me.</p>
<p>"It happens, but Tallboy keeps us off on our most risky days, has a herbalist with a pretty strong success rate at keeping pregnancies away after a guy cums in you, and a darker but equally strong success rate of dealing with those that beat the odds. He's got a few navy medics on the payroll to keep him apprised of what is the crotch rot dejure and how to spot those who have it, he's even been known to pay them a bonus to get them kept on the boat for treatment during shore leave." Ivy elaborated as she finished wiping off Garth's ejeculate and moved on to reapplying her makeup.</p>
<p>"Not exactly a hundred percent safety."</p>
<p>"Nothing in this life is." Ivy wistfully countered, as if that was an appropriate rebuttal. "How would you like to join in with the next client?"</p>
<p>At that I felt she had overstepped her familiarity and I immediately made my excuses to leave, this first night had been more than enough for my constitution.</p>
<p>Tallboy just chuckled as I walked out of the door.</p>
<p>I doubt there are many who have had a more surreal of an experience than I had explaining my night to my husband. Viscount Montegue at first seemed intrigued to learn the activities of the morally and economically destitute, but as my story became more lurid, he became more upset and saddened at the situation I had found myself in.</p>
<p>"I think this has gone far enough. I know it was a request from the king, but I feel like you have everything you need to not have to put yourself in danger any further." He quibbled.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I have only scratched the surface, a report completed at the personal request of the king should not have corners cut. This valuation angle is a great way of pushing forward with an economic analysis." I replied.</p>
<p>"Well maybe you could take this nugget and embellish around it, it's not like anyone at the royal court would know." He suggested, thinking he was being helpful, but only raising my hackles and along with them a desire not to have this descend into an argument.</p>
<p>"Let's not talk about that, you know how we get when our working lives collide. Besides, I had a better idea." I announced, walking over to my husband and sitting on his lap. "How would you like to try ravishing my body, before pulling out and finishing over my heaving bosom?"</p>
<p>"That you can think about sex after such an experience speaks to the absolute depravity of the environment in which you have been placed. I dare not cross the king or any that have his ear, but at first opportunity I will seek your speedy extrication from this horrendous situation. Until then I desire rest, and I highly suggest you avail yourself of it as well."</p>
<p>I did not get rest that night, in fact all I got was a pile of frustrations and heightened emotions. Part of me was upset with my husband for thinking me so fragile I needed his heroic political manoeuvring to rescue my dignity, while the other part had noticed that he was still not going to unless he could do so without making too many political waves. I once again thought back to the political expediency of our marriage and wondered what place love actually had in it.</p>
<p>These were all the thoughts swirling around my mind a few days later as I returned to Tallboy's building for another night of observation.</p>
<p>"Surprised you came back considering the rate of knots you sailed out of here the other night." Tallboy chuckled as I entered his establishment.</p>
<p>"No doubt what I witnessed was shocking, but I owe it to academia to do a full, thorough, and accurate report." I replied, rebuking my absent husband.</p>
<p>"Very well, quiet night tonight though, doubt you'll see too much new. Turns out those merchant clippers Earnie spotted were just doing an overnight stop for provisions so today seems to be locals only." Tallboy informed, leading me back down to the basement. It was quite a sight, the staff seemed to outnumber the customers and the few men availing themselves of services seemed in no hurry to move on to private rooms considering the attention they were getting. "You might see something interesting if I get word back from a friend of mine. Until then you might as well mingle."</p>
<p>"Well if that's the situation, would you mind if I saw your valuations of the girls working for you?" I asked to Tallboy's gruting agreement. He quickly scribbled down his analysis on a poece of parchment and let me study it as I sat in the basement observing the business at work.</p>
<p>I spent an hour making detailed notes of Tallboy's valuations for mathematical purposes before moving on to lots of small interviews with some of the working girls. They mostly confirmed what Ivy had told me with a few little tidbits along the way. I even deigned to try a glass of the alcohol being served, which I was expecting to be of a far lower quality considering the home-brewed nature of it. A man walked up to Tallboy and whispered something in his ear, a smile lit up his face and he called me over.</p>
<p>"You're about to see an innovation we wheel out for quiet nights like this one." He said to me before standing in the bar and banging a glass on the table to get the room's attention. "Tiffany, Bernadette, Carol, Flo, and Rachel. Promotion duty. Take the viscountess here so she can see what that means."</p>
<p>Five women groaned in unison at his order as they trudged up the steps. I followed behind them, curious but worried.</p>
<p>"Promotion basically means Tallboy has made sure nothing bad will happen to us, with the law or the public, if we go make it really clear what happens in here while standing in the street out front." The girl closest to me explained as they led me out of the front door. I was about to ask what that meant but my question was answered as soon as we emerged into the well lit street out front.</p>
<p>Immediately the women erupted into a chorus of beckonings and catcalls, men who were walking by were offered services in the bluntest possible terms. Worse still, it would become commonplace for an errant breast to escape recently loosened bodices, or for a cheeky flash of thigh to climb a bit too high and show off something far naughtier.</p>
<p>The street outside Tallboy's was a busy thoroughfare, the bustling high street at the heart of this poor section of town. I couldn't believe such a public and vibrant area would tolerate the sudden overtly sexual imposition of these ladies.</p>
<p>I watched the eyes of passing men linger on the depravity these girls were demonstrating, their manly designs always clearly arisen from the deviant show the women were putting on. But it was an absolute shock to the system for me to notice that as they scanned each girl, their eyes would inevitably wander over my body in turn. As far as they were concerned I was with them, one of the bodies for display and sale. Sure I was dressed far more conservatively, leading some men to wonder what angle the brothel was working, having a respectably dressed woman stand among the whores while trying to insist she wasn't with them. This nevertheless did not stop their wandering eyes, and the deep feeling of degrading warmth that ran over my body as they eyed me up for purchase.</p>
<p>As I stood wide-eyed and still, one of the women, in a fit of playfulness, decided to quickly lift up my skirt and display my bloomers to passersby. I screamed with embarrassment, collapsing into a ball as my world became surrounded by laughter. The prostitutes and the men gleefully agreeing that I needed to lighten up. My protestations that I was not for sale falling on deaf ears considering my continued insistence on staying in the company of whores advertising their wares.</p>
<p>From that moment on, small acts of picking on me became something of a trend. At first I found my bloomers becoming more and more familiar to the inhabitants of the area. The woman then moved to stolen kisses and at one point a very forceful act of groping on my well contained breasts. Each time I would scream in mortification while the working girls laughed.</p>
<p>"Would you cut out such behaviour, why would you do such a thing?" I yelled in frustration.</p>
<p>"Because the people love it. We've had way more people interested since we started playing around with you. We're not going to let you get a cock in you, that's our business. But you have to understand what gives you a small blush, puts food on our table. Now, are you so elitist you'd trade our livelihood to preserve the mystery of your unremarkable bloomers?" One of the women argued (I think it was Tiffany).</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"Yeah, I know you're embarrassed, but you've been a great sport, any girl here will tell you how I hate the aristocracy, but you're rapidly working your way towards being an exception." Another prostitute with fiery red hair added (or was she Tiffany?) These girls were clearly skilled at manipulation but I had to admit I was flattered and chastised in equal measure by their arguments. I ruminated on their points for a moderate amount of time before my train of thought was interrupted by the loosening of my corsetry and my mad scramble to correct my outfit before I suffered any indignant exposure.</p>
<p>Tallboy interrupted their fun as he emerged from his building beaming.</p>
<p>"I don't know what you guys are up to, but it's really working, the basement is almost full. I'd say three more men and you can ditch promotion for the night and come inside for some bonus clients." He announced, to everyone's relief.</p>
<p>"Hear that misters." One of the girls announced to a group of three men she had an ongoing conversation with. "You guys come in and we can join you, and you can bet we will be grateful."</p>
<p>"Sounds fun, but it would be sad for this uptight one to be allowed back in, can't we leave her out here to keep selling her wares?" One of the men joshed, I gave him a look of utter disapproval but it carried little weight without my status.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not, so how about we make it worth your while then." The prostitute countered. "How about you come in if we make sure this prude will be uncomfortable for the rest of the night?"</p>
<p>I was a perfect mixture of intrigue and fear as the women hungrily surrounded me.</p>
<p>"Do you know how much of a difference it will make getting off promotion tonight? The paydays are inside and we can be temporarily out of poverty. All you have to do is one simple thing..." the woman announced, in a loud hushed voice that said this was a salacious conversation but still one she wanted others to hear. "Take off your bloomers and hand them to these men, and you can believe we will all sing your praises at church on Sunday."</p>
<p>I struggled to believe that these women ever set foot in church, but I was also aware that Jesus was not an unknown figure to sex workers, indeed he brought them salvation, just like I could buy surrendering my bloomers. I stood frozen in indecision before one of the men who issued the ultimatum spoke up with a sigh.</p>
<p>"I guess she's not going to do it. Sorry ladies, we're going to see if there's anything else to do tonight." He announced, provoking a wave of disappointed wailing from my entourage. My brain fizzed in panic, I felt like I was about to let myself down and I found myself squeaking in defeated embarrassment.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright. You can have my bloomers." I squealed. Immediately the atmosphere changed to one of jubilation and expectation. As the whole street looked on, I awkwardly hiked up the smallest portion of my dress possible, grabbing the bottom of one of the ruffled legs of my bloomers from the knee and pulling them lopsidedly downwards to an echo of cheers and catcalls. I very uncertainly kneeled down and cautiously extricated the pile of fabric wrapped around my feet.</p>
<p>My body was enveloped in red hot mortification as one of the girls triumphantly handed my bloomers to the three men, who held them aloft like a battle standard, leading a victorious brigade of perversion into Tallboy's establishment. As I took my place amongst them, I also discovered the unique experience of walking with no underclothes, my nethers essentially exposed to the elements beneath a dress acting as the only barrier of respectability.</p>
<p>The air warmed and stilled as I stepped inside but the sensation of walking remained profoundly lurid. The speed at which I descended into the basement was comparable to a snail drawn carriage as I fussed and blustered to ensure nobody got a look up my skirt. By the time I arrived, one of the workers already had a drink waiting for me at the bar, by way of thanks. My bashfulness around liquor evaporated immediately in the face of the night I'd already had.</p>
<p>I took my drink and sat in the corner with quill and parchment, eager to write up my notes and throw myself into the distraction academia offered.</p>
<p>I had been hard at my studies for some time when I became aware that a man was trying to get my attention. I looked up and saw one of the trio men who had relieved me of my bloomers earlier, albeit not the one currently in possession of them.</p>
<p>"So what's your story? You don't look like someone who should be here." He drunkenly noted.</p>
<p>"I've been sent here as part of a royal commission to study the habits of prostitutes and their clients." I informed, not letting the obvious audience oblivion cloud the clarity of my response.</p>
<p>"Woah, so you're a royal." He astutely misobserved.</p>
<p>"No, just a viscountess, but the king himself instructed me to be here to observe and learn." I replied, trying to impress upon him the respect he should be treating me with.</p>
<p>"Wow, and how much did the king demand you charge for a fuck?" He asked, his hand beginning to run up my leg. I hesitated, I do not know where this hesitation came from, but his hand was firmly upon my thigh before the sensation of his hand directly of skin formally covered by my bloomers sparked me out of my stupor long enough to swat his hand away with bluntness and assurance.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not available I'm afraid." I stated in a voice that sounded far more breathy and less confident than when I planned it in my head.</p>
<p>"You're sat there with no bloomers on, telling me I'm not allowed a piece?" He asked incredulously, I was readying myself for him to disregard my objections and have his beastly way with me, but instead he glanced around the room, and took a deep breath to calm himself down. "Just to be clear, because Tallboy has a earned a nasty rep from men who don't take no for an answer, you're not playing hard to get, you are flat out turning me down?"</p>
<p>I hesitated again, for an absurdly long time that did not result in any clarification.</p>
<p>"You're barking up the wrong tree with her love." Interrupted the fiery redhead who had been with me during promotion, sensing an opportunity to pick up an easy sale. "Besides, you try anything with her you'd have to brush away the cobwebs first."</p>
<p>They laughed raucously and I joined in with nervous embarrassment as she began to lead him away. She whispered something in his ear which stopped him in his tracks before turning back to me.</p>
<p>"I apologise viscountess." He announced bowing before me. In solidarity the girl he was with also bowed low and solemnly. I allowed myself a moment to magnanimously accept their apology, not realising it was a ruse until too late.</p>
<p>As the woman straightened up, in one swift movement she also lifted my skirt, causing it to billow upwards in an explosion of fabric. For one brief second, the whole basement could see the unclad glory hiding beneath my dress. Most were looking in one way or another, but I saw a smattering of eyes and heard enough guffaws to confirm I had indeed been exposed and seen.</p>
<p>Since my first bleed, only 2 men had ever seen my most intimate parts; my doctor and my husband. Now, with the flick of a whores wrist, that number had at least tripled in the blink of an eye. I squealed and bundled up my dress tight to me to prevent another such incident, then I found myself drinking in the wellspring of appreciation among the guests. From my humiliation, a sense of rare magnificence was granted, those privileged enough to have seen up my skirt considered themselves as lucky as one who had seen the beast of Bodmin or the northern lights. I sunk into my blush and went back to my work, but subconsciously I found myself untucking my dress from beneath me once my heart rate began to settle.</p>
<p>As I returned to my deepest studies, I felt a strange sensation in my upper body, a loosening of sorts. I wondered if a mixture of the alcohol and my comfort with the situation was leading to a physical manifestation of my tension dissipating. It was almost too late when I noticed what had actually happened was that the corseting in my bodice was being stealthily loosened from behind by yet another cheeky working girl. On reflection it made sense, the teasing of my proper status was the reason a lot of the clients were in tonight, so of course these sort of hijinks would continue even after the men in possession of my bloomers had disappeared off to private rooms.</p>
<p>I suitably chastised the miscreant to scare her off, but I never retightened my dress, instead I allowed my bust more freedom as got up to have another drink at the bar, the warming blurring of mental barriers certainly having an affect on my current comfort levels.</p>
<p>As I downed my glass and ordered another, I saw an old friend take her place next to me. Ivy was in good spirits having already earned far more than she would usually expect from a 'slow' night, she wrapped her arm around my waist as she ordered herself a drink.</p>
<p>"I hear you're getting a lot of attention tonight. How are you finding it?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Would you understand if I said it was a strange mix of mortifying and exhilarating." I replied with uncharacteristic honestly.</p>
<p>"That's the magic of places like these I guess." She observed, I felt her hand rubbing against my back in a strange way but thought nothing of it. "You have to work hard for money, but appreciation is free and easy."</p>
<p>"Do you know anyone who took up your profession despite not needing to?" I asked, it was a pretty poor sentence for hiding what my smut and booze addled brain had begun processing.</p>
<p>"Closest I can say is the men who bring their wives in with them. One moment she's all disapproving and weighed with obligation. The next he has her skirt up and is feeling her ass like it's the first time." Ivy explained, it seemed like a strange tangent to go on until I realised what her hand had been doing on my lower back. All of a sudden I could feel her hand directly on my bottom, no intervening fabric.</p>
<p>I should have given her the same stern talking to that I gave the man running his hand up my thigh, or at least backed away, asked her to stop, something other than what I ended up doing instead.</p>
<p>I let out a moan, an unambiguous moan of enjoyment, loud enough that there was no way Ivy could miss it.</p>
<p>"See those men don't bring in their wives to share a prostitute, they're obsessed with the fantasy that through their corruption, the good woman they know will be willing to lower themselves to the status of a lowly whore." Ivy continued to explain as she kneaded my buttocks. "And of course they don't wait for the bedroom, they tease them and drive them wild with passion right here in the basement."</p>
<p>Ivy leant over and to my shock, pressed her lips to mine, she swung around to embrace me, her other hand joining the first on my bottom to firmly grab it and pull my pelvis to hers. My passion overflowed and the world swirled as uncontained lust overrode every brain cell screaming for logic and self-preservation.</p>
<p>"When things get this wild." Ivy continued, her mouth only an inch from mine. "They don't even care that the whole basement is staring at her depravity."</p>
<p>I turned and let out a squeak as I saw the wall of eyes staring at Ivy and me. She had hiked up my dress so all that stood between my bottom and my audience were her hands. As she spread my cheeks all I did was grip her tighter and bite her neck in humiliation as the crowd cheered for my total exposure.</p>
<p>"You're interested in our lives for a reason far beyond the king's orders aren't you? Did you know you were clearly trying to subtly touch yourself when you watched Garth fucking me? You want to know what it's like to be a sex object like us. Well here's your chance; I'm going to step away and finish my drink, leaving you dangling in this state between bliss and discomfort. By the time I finish my drink one of two things will happen, either you will still be wearing that dress and I will escort you out unmolested, or you will drop that dress on the floor and be ready for me to give you pleasure you have never felt before, right here, with everybody watching."</p>
<p>Ivy's ultimatum sent shockwaves through my system. As she disengaged all I could feel was longing to have her back on me, then as she began to down her drink, that longing was brutally replaced with panic. Her embrace, the delightful degradation, the destruction of my status only to embrace a new life of carnal desires, it all called me to a deeply dark place. Would I, a viscountess, really strip myself down to become a sex show in the basement of a brothel? Ivy took her mouth away from her cup and showed me the dregs of that sinful liquid in the bottom.</p>
<p>"Last chance." She chirped. I panicked and immediately pulled my loosened bodice open, allowing the dress to cascade down my body to the floor. The petticoat underneath came off in a far less dignified way but soon I found myself standing stark naked in a room full of whores and Johns cheering my exposure.</p>
<p>Ivy slinked up to me and put her hands on my shoulders. I was expecting her to kiss me, but instead she turned me around, forcing me to face the crowd of admirers, giving them an unfettered view of my exposed breasts and incredibly moistened vagina. Ivy embraced me from behind, her errant hands painting a picture of smut on the canvas of my nude form. She cupped my breasts with one hand, while the other wiggled its way between my legs and began playing with my lower lips. The entire time my field of vision was filled only by the gathered audience watching my consensual molestation. As I glanced around the audience, catching Tallboy's eye seemed to be the worst moment, his lecherous grin boding poorly for the remainder of my investigation.</p>
<p>Ivy's unerring hands guided me backwards until I was pushed up against the bar, she lifted me up and sat me down on the bar's edge, then pushed my knees apart, pausing for a moment so the audience could get a look at my spread eagle before plunging her face between my legs to taste my juices.</p>
<p>Her tongue darted and dashed against my pussy, sometimes she would bite just enough to get purchase before unleashing a whole new wave of perverted pleasure upon my body. For my part I began to moan and squeal with such vigour I'm sure many in the audience thought it was part of the show, but it was most assuredly a real part of my enforced sexual awakening.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, yes, oh fuck yes!" I yelled with reckless abandon as the crowd watched another woman devour me to orgasm. I squeezed my own breasts, tousled my own hair, and generally made myself a slave to my own sensations in front of the baying crowd.</p>
<p>Once delivered from my fall, I now found myself naked and in an ultimate pit of shame as the full impact of what I had just indulged hit me. Tallboy handed me back my dress with some cheeky banter about its near theft, but all I was able to hear was the ringing in my ears as I stormed out of the den I lost my dignity to.</p>
<p>How do you go back to a respectable life after that? I returned home that night and kissed my husband on the cheek as I retired to bed early. He didn't know that moments earlier, his wife was letting strangers watch her naked body convulsing with pleasure as a whore gave her oral sex. He didn't know that my bloomers were still circulating among disreputable men in the disrespectable sections of town. How would he respond if he knew?</p>
<p>He'd probably worry about his status.</p>
<p>What of my study? I couldn't go back after that, after they have seen me so vulnerable, so below my station. I took a moment to think through what this meant for my investigation and came to a conclusion profound enough I said it out loud to nobody.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>Sure it was uncouth, but it didn't affect my ability to extract information from the operation, in fact I'm sure many would now open up to me, seeing kinship in our mutually compromised status.</p>
<p>After a long and fitful sleep I woke up more optimistic than before, especially seeing as I was not due to return to Tallboy's operation for another couple of days, and today I was to talk with my supervisor about progress.</p>
<p>Someone had once told me that Doctor Sutcliffe was only 39, he looked at least double that as his wiry frame hunched over my notes.</p>
<p>"So building trust with the individual workers has been slow going, but I have gathered plenty of information about the operation and mechanics of this black market." I explained.</p>
<p>"What you have discovered so far is indeed a fascination, and as is your style, you are building up a solid base of monetary data to quantify your findings, but it is not something we can build strong policy recommendations on beyond maybe new guidelines for the police in the pimp's pockets to ignore." Dr. Sutcliffe replied in his trademark measured tone. "What we really need is more qualitative information on what drives people to partake in, and indeed become, purveyors of loose morals. Some individual stories and anecdotes that add a human touch to the statistical model you are building"</p>
<p>I chuckled to myself that I was getting a first hand lesson in that, but not a word of it would appear in my notes.</p>
<p>"Much has been speculated of course, financial desperation, drug addiction, certain forms of non-consensual coercion. Each with a different policy solution. I'm sure it will turn out to be a deep mixture of factors but if we advocate a scatter shot policy approach the king will think us grasping at straws. So where I think we should focus is one simple question: what makes a reputable woman become a prostitute?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't agree with you more." I replied.</p>
<p>It had been a few days since my last visit to Tallboy's establishment. I had spent those days in the library getting a strong foundation of literature to bookend my studies. I was feeling much calmer and detached than I had in the past and I expected to be able to follow my investigative nose with maximum focus.</p>
<p>I entered the building and all seemed quiet, granted I was there too early in the day for any business operations to be underway, this was by design as I wanted a quiet moment to talk to the girls. Nevertheless I was intercepted by Tallboy who welcomed me with a wider grin than usual and invited me back to his office.</p>
<p>"So viscountess, what's your plans for today?" He asked jovially.</p>
<p>"Well I have decided I need to spend less time examining your operation and more time talking to the people within it." I explained, wincing at his knowing gaze running the length of my body.</p>
<p>"I see, what are you looking to discover?" He replied.</p>
<p>"Just what exactly it takes for a good woman to find herself part of this life?"</p>
<p>"Well you already know a bit of that already. What was it that drove you to put on a show for the bar like that?" I had wondered how long it would take for Tallboy to mention my humiliation.</p>
<p>"That was the alcohol." I curtly responded, trying to cut off this line of enquiry.</p>
<p>"You do something like that every time you have a drink? No, it's not just the booze, that just lowered your defences. Different people respond to what I do differently, some are disgusted, or fearful, or angry. But you, you have been intrigued since day one." He monologued, I felt the need to interrupt just to prevent him getting up a head of steam.</p>
<p>"Of course I am intrigued, it's an intriguing area of study." I interrupted.</p>
<p>"You don't need to be coy, this isn't the sort of place people need to have shame in. The primary pull here, for everyone involved, is that nobody needs to feel bad about indulgence." He elaborated. I wanted to respond with a categorical denial, but the philosophers of old currently failed me. "So what would you have mainly been asking about today?"</p>
<p>"I would have been asking about how they were hired by you." I stated in a daze.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"Well, believe it or not, most women come to me, I sit them down in that chair, and I tell them that the first thing they need to do is have a valuation. I cast my expert eye over them, and tell them precisely how much I could get away with charging for their bodies. It's actually very gratifying for the women who use it, they get to know exactly what they are worth in cold, hard, objective cash." Tallboy explained. As he did so I felt a warmth rising up within me, his gaze reminded me of the night I lost my senses, and his words dangled lucious possibilities of more. My words had no force as I pushed back.</p>
<p>"Surely people aren't actually happy to have a monetary value put on them?" I whimpered without any force to my words.</p>
<p>"If I told you, that you could leave this office knowing objectively how sexy you are, how much men would sacrifice just to be with you. Would you take it?" He asked, leaving me to wonder what manner of mind reading he had discovered.</p>
<p>My curiosity ran wild, all my sensibilities seemed to be shutting down. The social scientist within me should have been focussed on the language he was using to trick me into making a mistake, but all it could focus on was the curious certainly of using money as a metric to measure something as subjective as sexiness. The woman in me should have had her guard up to yet another man trying to sweet talk her, but instead felt a wave of appreciation, for her herself and not just her birthright, her status, or one of a myriad of social complexities designed to muddy the waters of interpersonal interactions.</p>
<p>"I would be lying if I said I wasn't curious, but I think..." I weakly began.</p>
<p>"No need to think, and don't worry I'll show my working as I go so you'll have lots to write about in your report." He interrupted, taking my tone and roundabout phrasing as tacit consent. "So first you need to stand up, first impressions are what get people through the door so I need to see you as someone seeing you for the first time would."</p>
<p>He was already starting the valuation on me. He had decided to go ahead and tell me what I would be worth as a whore, how much money people would leave on my bedside table after having their wicked way with me. I should have objected, pushed back, put this to an end before it could begin. I shouldn't have done what I did, which was to obediently stand up, and let him begin his investigation.</p>
<p>"So these clothes, although classy, are fairly conservative. That seemed to do you well in promotion yesterday but I will be looking past that as any girl could wear them. Instead we should talk about your height and build, you have clearly lived a healthier life than my girls, you are taller and more full figured than a girl who comes from poverty. Your makeup is undoubtedly more expensive, although once again I will be looking past that as I would expect you to use cheaper stuff if you were working for me. This hair is fantastic though, it has been maintained with treatments and tinctures far beyond what anyone around here could afford. Those brown curly locks will have a lot of men going gaga for them, hell some will probably pay to make sure their seed is clinging to it by the end of the night."</p>
<p>I couldn't believe that I was feeling myself blush with pride over Tallboy stating parts of me that men would want to spoil, but I never interrupted him.</p>
<p>"Your skin is pretty clear, no obvious sores or signs of the kind of infections modest women get. Open your mouth."</p>
<p>He gave me an order. This pimp gave a viscountess an order. No ceremony or honourifics, not even a 'please'. He simply told me to open my mouth so he could keep evaluating my body for sex. And I did it, at his bidding I opened my mouth wide and he stared into it.</p>
<p>"Mighty fine dental work, no missing teeth and what remain are well looked after, I dare say you'd probably have the most alluring smile of the lot."</p>
<p>I giggled, he heard me do it and everything. He talked about me luring men to use my body for their debauched desires and my response was not one of revulsion but of a giddy schoolgirl being handed a sweet bun. Next, without asking, he took my hands and turned them over in his.</p>
<p>"Soft, no callouses, these are clearly the hands of a lady who has never had to do manual labour. If you held a man's hand he would certainly note the softness and wonder how it would feel wrapped around his member. Although now I hold your hand I do feel one callous, why do you have this on your middle finger?" He asked.</p>
<p>Throughout this whole process he had not sought my input on anything, now he was suddenly calling on me to account for myself. I'd never felt so infantilised while paradoxically feeling so sexualised. I was being asked why I had an imperfection that was getting in the way of me being the perfect sex object.</p>
<p>"It's a writer's blister, you get it from a quill rubbing against your fingers for extensive periods of writing." I immediately explained.</p>
<p>"I don't think many men around here would be familiar with that." He mumbled as he got down on his knees and bent over at my feet. "Take off your shoes."</p>
<p>Once again no semblance of the word please, just an order for me to obey, and I did. Still reeling from how my academic prowess led to a physical mark that probably brought my value down, I found myself eager to do whatever it took to raise it again, so his words had barely left his mouth as I was removing my shoes.</p>
<p>"Nice feet, no blisters or signs of ill fitting footwear, perfectly smooth ankle. A lot of men are into feet, never understood it myself, but there is a lot of value to be had in a good set of feet like yours." I blushed at his compliment and felt another wellspring of strange pride at my valuation going so well. "So that's all the external stuff, the things that will get the men into bed with you."</p>
<p>"Fantastic, and how much do you think you could charge for me?" I asked, now seriously invested in the answer.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that's only half of it, if I want my pricing trusted, and repeat business, it's time to investigate more intimate details. So you're going to need to remove all of your clothes." He ordered, in the closest thing to a conciliatory tone since I stepped foot in his office. I stood stunned still, I was so invested in finding out my worth, I wanted nothing more than to get to the end of this valuation and truly discover my intrinsic value. But now I was being told that meant stripping for Tallboy.</p>
<p>Sure he's seen me naked before, but that time I was drunk and impaired, just going with the erotic flow of the evening. This would be different, this would be a sober and blatant act of submission, a viscountess surrendering her superior status to a pimp whose only goal was to sell her body as his possession. He could clearly read my stunned resistance.</p>
<p>"This is a valuation to see how much you are worth, there's a pretty abrupt ending on the horizon if you don't take off your clothes. Selling a woman who won't take off her clothes is like selling a cart without wheels. You would be worthless." He bluntly stated.</p>
<p>The word 'worthless' struck me to my core. There were so many tangled emotions with what I was going through, but that one word cut through it all, it was the one thing I simply couldn't accept of myself, I am not a worthless woman.</p>
<p>I reached behind my back and loosened the corsetry on my dress, the first step towards surrendering it along with all my other garments. The pressure of my dress being held to my body loosened and with some minor alterations and deliberate arm placements, I eventually felt it slide down my body onto the floor. Next I pulled my petticoat up and over my body. Tallboy was sat there in patient curiosity as I stood before him wearing only my bloomers, studying me as I would study a wall of library books trying to pick out which one would suffice for my study. His expression barely changed as I bent over to pull down my bloomers and then straightened up in exposed fear. My naked body felt like a butterfly pinned to a firm piece of wood under the diligent magnifying glass of a skilled entomologist.</p>
<p>"Very good." Tallboy stated in a matter of fact way as he stood up and began examining my nudity. "You are clearly healthy. Plumper than my average girl, a wealthy diet will do that, but you are not overweight, many men aren't in the market to sleep with a girl larger than them. Those breasts are magnificent."</p>
<p>A compliment from the man who now held me in the palm of his hand, and I was so excited to hear it. I should have been feeling all manner of shame and sadness to be in such a debased form, but if being naked was what it took to have my breasts complimented by a man who had no reason to do so, it was a price worth paying for the compliment.</p>
<p>"A lot of men would pay good money to watch these huge monsters bounce up and down as they fuck you. Your nipples are darker than average, but are perfectly in proportion and just look so good to nibble on. And as you are still young, they haven't drooped yet, they're still large and perky. Truly amazing tits." Tallboy elaborated.</p>
<p>"Thank you." I replied before I could catch the words coming out of my mouth. This pimp had just subjected me, an aristocrat, to the most base of objectifications and instead of taking offence I was thanking him. As I tried to process just what was wrong with me, I felt two hands clamp themselves against my breasts, kneading them with efficient intensity.</p>
<p>"Firm too." Tallboy explained. "For the man who likes a handful of breasts you are indeed a perfect specimen." His hands lingered on my breasts longer than was needed for the observation, yet still I found myself unmoving.</p>
<p>"Now let's talk about your pussy." He announced, disengaging from my breasts. "It's in peak health, but it is also completely unshaven. I provide my girls with some well sharpened straight razors to keep their bush firmly out of the way. I will try to look past it for now but if it remains unshaved it will affect your value."</p>
<p>"Well then I must shave it at once." I replied. I couldn't believe myself, of all the indignities I had suffered so far, all the orders and insults, and the time I put my foot down is the time I am told to wait to alter myself to make my body better for selling for sex.</p>
<p>"Very well, bathroom is down the hall on the left." Tallboy agreed, sitting back down in his chair. I gathered up my clothes and began to rearrange them. "Haven't got all day, just leave the clothes here, it's not exactly a private bathroom anyway."</p>
<p>Once again he was essentially ordering me, this time to walk the halls of his building naked. I was a woman of high standing, I shouldn't be in this situation, but still I gave a strange psudo-nod of agreement before dropping my clothes and walking over to the door.</p>
<p>My hands were gripped at my sides, tight enough that they could have crushed coal into diamonds as I began to walk down the hallway. At first the hallway was empty, but it only took a couple of beats of my racing heart before a working girl left her room and walked past me in the hallway. For me it was a crushing humiliation, the whore was clothed, going about her day with agency and purpose, and I had to get out of her way as I was the fallen woman ordered to walk the halls of her house, naked and subjugated. She gave me a look that screamed of judgement but didn't say anything as she passed by.</p>
<p>The bathroom had several buckets of fresh water, and in the corner there were some straight razors nestled between some bottles of some kind of lotion. I squatted down in the corner and began to try and work out what I was meant to be doing.</p>
<p>"Well, well, well. I thought that was you." Drawled a smug voice from the door. I turned to see the fiery redhead from my night on promotion. "Fallen on hard times, have we?"</p>
<p>"No, it's not like that at all, Tiffany." I sputtered.</p>
<p>"I'm Bernadette." She corrected with a disapproving sneer.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I'm just going through a valuation, for my study, and Mr. Tallboy said I needed to be shaved." I explained.</p>
<p>"You're putting yourself through all this just to see what our lives are like?" Bernadette asked with some genuine intrigue.</p>
<p>"I have been asked to report on what a woman getting into this profession goes through, and Mr. Tallboy offered to show me, so I took him up on the offer." I replied. Bernadette's eyes softened and she let her face fall into a grin.</p>
<p>"Well, if you don't know what you're doing with that you could end up cutting off your clit. Here, let me do it." She asserted as she walked into the room and immediately reached for a bottle of lotion to spread over my pubis. "I don't know what to make of you, you're either a good egg or a total freak."</p>
<p>I didn't know myself.</p>
<p>Bernadette lathered me up and then began expertly running the razor over my pussy, sparingly using water just to wash off the blade after each series of expert strokes. I was fixed in place with a mixture of admiration and fear of cuts.</p>
<p>"Just so you know, Tallboy may treat us better than the average pimp, but he still isn't a nice man." Bernadette announced out of nowhere. "Nobody who maintains power over others is."</p>
<p>"Is that why you don't like aristocrats?" I asked, trying to find anything to distract myself from Bernadette's focus on my vagina.</p>
<p>"A bit. People like Tallboy have to do bad things to survive and prosper in this world. But there is a class that gets all the power right off the bat, no need to morally compromise, could fix a lot for the downtrodden, and still they choose to be corrupt and selfish. I mean what's even the point? If I was born into enough power to change things, I would want to change them for the better. If you're above board then at least there's one aristocrat trying." Bernadette took the remainder of the bucket of water and poured it over my freshly shaved vagina, leaving it clean and smooth.</p>
<p>"Thank you." I replied. "For the shave, and the talk."</p>
<p>"Any time sister." Bernadette joked as she left. I spent a lot of time staring at my now bare privates, the curves of my labia now unobscured, my body modified to make sex easier for strangers. It took a while to shake myself out of my stupor and begin returning to Tallboy's office.</p>
<p>As I walked down the hallway I felt even more exposed than before. Before I was merely stripped, any circumstances could have separated me from my clothes, but my recently shaved pussy marked me as a woman preparing herself to be a sex object. It did not help that word had travelled far and there were a bunch of prostitutes I was familiar with, watching me return to Tallboy with my body prepared. One of the girls from the promotion (most likely Tiffany) gave a wolf whistle, Ivy was also there to very loudly refer to me as a viscountess. But the most embarrassing viewer was a complete stranger, a man popping out of a room alongside one of the other girls from promotion, clearly my walk of shame had interrupted their ongoing transaction.</p>
<p>"Very sexy, how much for a ride on you next." He exclaimed, his erect penis in his hand.</p>
<p>"I'm about to find out." I whimpered as I passed him. He reached out and grabbed my bottom and I did nothing to stop him. I had never felt so low.</p>
<p>I gave Tallboy a weak grin as I re-entered his office. I had just gone through all of that for him, for his approval, it sickened me how much I wanted him to value me. He simply grunted in acknowledgement before carrying on the valuation.</p>
<p>"Good pussy, no signs of infection, plump labia." He analysed. Then without warning he ran his finger down my pubis and stroked between my recently shaved lips. I moaned with humiliated delight as he examined his finger like a chemist with a test tube. "Very wet, a cock would slide in there pretty smoothly."</p>
<p>I was left grinning like a fool that my vagina looked so accommodating for cocks. As I did so Tallboy returned to his desk and fetched a wooden phallus, which he then handed to me.</p>
<p>"How far can you get this down your throat without choking?" He asked, an order dressed up as a question. I gave the wooden phallus an incredulous look, then plunged it down my throat. It did not make it far before it came back up in a volley of gagging and coughing.</p>
<p>"As I suspected, not very experienced. A man is going to want to stick his cock down your throat for a bit before he fucks you with it. If you're barely making it to the tonsils it's going to limit your client base." He explained.</p>
<p>I felt the deepest shame so far. I should have been ashamed of my stripping, my dignity being readily discarded, even my naked body being openly judged and sexualised; but no, I was ashamed at my shortcomings as a sex object.</p>
<p>"You ever taken a cock in your ass?" He asked without pretension. While waiting for me to get over the bluntness of the question, he walked around my body and pulled apart my cheeks so he could get an unfettered view of my rosebud.</p>
<p>"No, I haven't."</p>
<p>"You should start training, you've got a pretty little starfish here and men would love to jam a dick up it. Plus the ass is a safer bet for when a man wants to finish inside of you." He explained. I found myself genuinely resolving to try placing things in there when I had spare time.</p>
<p>"Alright, that should do it." Tallboy announced taking a seat behind his desk. "You're a great body but with nowhere near the experience to be considered elite, you have a bright future if you commit yourself to your new profession, you certainly have one of the highest valuations I've ever given a new girl. If a man asks how much to fuck you, you can now reply in confidence: 19 shillings."</p>
<p>My body glowed with feelings I couldn't put into words. What he was saying was very complimentary, and I'm sure the price he had given me was a flattering one, but I couldn't help but think what small change it was for people in my circles. I was priced a shilling under a pound (probably on purpose), when we have our chimneys swept by children, we pay them a pound a chimney. When a vagrant chased off a would be robber I gave him a pound as thanks, if I had let him fuck me to say thank you, I would have been short changing him.</p>
<p>"So, anything else you want to know?" Tallboy asked with trademark detachment. It knocked me out of my stupor and I mumbled something about getting lunch before bundling on my clothes and leaving.</p>
<p>The figure of 19 shillings swirled in my brain for the next couple of days as I joined my husband for a country retreat where he and a Baron could hatch political schemes in the comfort of a stately home. The new unit of value in my mind became ravishing my body. A new dress to wear with matching parasol and jewelry no longer cost 20 pounds, it cost 21 sessions fucking me with a shilling to spare. Instead of paying the jeweller a pound to polish my sterling silver necklace, I should have just taken off my clothes and let him thrust his cock into me right there by the cash register. When my husband tipped the stable lad a pound to take good care of our horse and cart, I imagined him saying.</p>
<p>"My good sir, please take extra good care of our horses. Here, as a token of good faith, feel free to tear off my wife's clothes and fuck her in her mouth, cunt or ass. Afterwards, just round it up, you can also have a shilling."</p>
<p>These weekends away were always unbearable for me. Friends of my husband never know whether to treat me as a wife or academic, so they often resort to allowing me to mutely sit in the corner during discussions about me with occasional nods to my existence independent of my husband's status.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry my wife couldn't be here to greet you in person." The ermine walrus blubbered at my husband over sherry. "But the morning sickness has started to become quite weighty."</p>
<p>"Well that's because you've put a stout lad into her, I'm surprised she isn't already eating pipe tobacco and matches just to get the lad used to the good stuff." My husband gushed in response.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>"You've had time to settle down these days, any inclination of siring your own strapping lad? After all, my boy's going to need a wicket keeper." The Baron chuckled. It's amazing how society had learned to dress up what is fundamentally a very intimate conversation. He was asking if the viscount had been getting his 19 shillings worth recently but in a way everyone seemed to find acceptable.</p>
<p>"Alas this recent order from the king has kept that ship firmly out of the dock, so to speak. If Melody becomes with child at the same time as she is doing hands on research in the brothels of the city, even though she would never be a part of such degenerate activities, you know tongues would flap and all kinds of stories would emerge from the ether to challenge my son's legitimacy." My husband explained as if I were merely a portrait on the wall.</p>
<p>"Horrible business that. There's no excuse for such dishonourable conduct. I almost wish he hadn't done such marvellous things with our navy or I would be shoulder to shoulder with you getting the blighter off the king's ear." The Baron explained. Learning that my virtue was worth less than good naval strategy would have thrown me more in the past, but now I just chuckled that I now knew the clever movement of ships was worth more than 19 shillings. "Well, you're making the most of it anyway my dear."</p>
<p>"Indeed so, it is a fascinating area of study and I feel like if I throw myself into it I can help the king save a lot of women from a life of low morals." I replied, aware that my opinion wasn't being sought, just confirmation that I was remaining virtuous among the whores, regardless of how untrue such a confirmation was.</p>
<p>"Well, my dear, I'm sure you don't want to hang around while we blather on about hunting arrangements and cricket scores, your luggage must surely be in the guest room by now if you'd like to unpack after such a long journey." The Baron noted, the subtle request that I fuck off and let him have time with his buddy was not lost on me and I left. Sat alone in the guest room unpacking our things, I wondered what I was going to do with the weekend to myself. As I unpacked my hairbrush, a mischievous idea crossed my mind.</p>
<p>"Might as well work on getting that last shilling." I said to myself as I started pushing the brush down my throat to begin the long process of getting rid of my gag reflex.</p>
<p>An intriguing dread creeped over my body as I once again approached Tallboy's premises. Prescient in my mind was how far my morals had already been corrupted through only a couple of visits, and yet I was just excited to be returning. I had spent the weekend using every alone moment to tease my tonsils with my hairbrush and had even placed the handle of a shaving cream brush inside my anus once or twice. I had been training my body for its deviant subjugation and now I was once again walking back into the den of depravity that pushed these hideous desires upon me.</p>
<p>I strolled into the building and with practised familiarity proceeded to the basement where the early stirrings of the night were beginning. A few men were getting drinks and talking to a smattering of the early risers among the prostitutes. I simply sat to one side to have a quiet drink and soak up the atmosphere.</p>
<p>After a bit of time Tallboy entered, in yet another well tailored suit over his gigantic mass, he sauntered over to me the moment our eyes met across the room.</p>
<p>"So viscountess, what are your plans for tonight?" He asked in a leading way.</p>
<p>"You're looking at them." I nonchalantly replied, not looking to give Tallboy any ideas.</p>
<p>"Alright then, Ernie says there's a couple of frigates on the horizon, not enough for an AHOD but enough to send a couple of girls to the port to make sure they end up here. It should be a reasonably busy night." He warned as he tried to head off to his office.</p>
<p>"Oh, before you go." I called after him, "the valuations you do on your girls, how often do you do them?"</p>
<p>"Want to know when you can have another run at being worth over a pound? Well it's not on a timescale, it's based on how much a girl is bringing in. If they're being fucked a lot, I've clearly undervalued them, if only a few men are paying the price then I have priced them too high. You want a new valuation, you have to start selling your ass." He quipped as he left the basement.</p>
<p>As Tallboy was leaving, I saw another familiar face squeeze by him on the way down. Private Wayne Cosgrove, the brash sailor who had engineered my introduction to Tallboy and this world. At first he locked eyes with me and looked incredibly bashful, but I gave him a warm smile and invited him to drink with me.</p>
<p>"Alright your ladyship?" He awkwardly asked as the bartender, at my bidding, poured a drink in front of him.</p>
<p>"I'm very well thank you Private Cosgrove." I replied with disarming familiarity. "I've been learning so much for my report, I simply cannot thank you enough for the introduction."</p>
<p>"Right... what 'ave you learned so far?" He asked, trying to gauge how much conversation he's required to give me, on account of my station, before he could ditch the formalities and go attempt to sleep with a prostitute. I downed my drink and ordered another.</p>
<p>"Well I've learned so much about Mr. Tallboy's operation, how he treats his girls, how much my pussy is worth, how he decides staffing levels..." I grinned at the sudden shocked look on Wayne's face as he processed what I had just said.</p>
<p>"Sorry, wot?" He asked.</p>
<p>"His staffing levels, yes apparently he has a sophisticated way of assessing future demand." I joked, seeing that Wayne wasn't going to break protocol to ask me to clarify my bait, I walked it back. "Or were you more interested in my pussy? Mr. Tallboy had me naked in his office so he could examine my body, and he said that were I a whore, he would expect men to pay 19 shillings to violate me. Could you imagine such a thing?"</p>
<p>I could tell by Wayne's closed eyes and tightening trousers that he was in fact imagining just that.</p>
<p>"Of course a lady of my stature could never countenance such an embarrassing fall from grace. I'd have to be drunk and with someone familiar for such a thing to happen. Would you like another drink?" This was dangerous. At first I felt like it was fun to joke with Wayne, but as my words gained momentum and the familiar dizzying fog of alcohol lowered my inhibitions, it started to feel more and more like I was soliciting business.</p>
<p>"...yes please." Replied Wayne, not knowing what to do with himself.</p>
<p>The bartender continued to pour and I continued to drink, delighting in pulling back from salacious talk to discuss academia and my paper, but occasionally leaving disgraceful suggestions in the mix.</p>
<p>"...And then I had to expense this all to the university, I had to play around with labelling as the ethics department would never have let me pay you for an introduction otherwise. I hope you made good use of that money."</p>
<p>"Got called away for duty that day, this is the first chance I've 'ad." Wayne replied.</p>
<p>"Well I certainly remember giving you more than 19 shillings." I replied with a deep blush.</p>
<p>"So... if I were to give you 19 shillings right now..." Wayne began, finally seizing the moment we were inevitably working towards. Before any of my higher functions could intervene I leant towards him, grabbed his hand and led it up my skirt and along my leg.</p>
<p>"If you pay me 19 shillings, you can make a whore of me. You can take this pristine honourable viscountess, and dirty her with your cock before leaving her a common prostitute." I led his hand further and further up my dress, tucking it under my bloomers so he could venture up my thighs and feel how wet my pussy was. "Please tell me you have 19 shillings on you, because I want to be your dirty degraded sex object."</p>
<p>Wayne was silent and still. His face drained of colour from the rapid redirection of blood. He reached into his pocket with his spare hand, pushed aside his erection, and picked out a pound note.</p>
<p>"You can make change right?" He stammered out. I took the note, placed it in my purse, handed him a shilling, then planted my lips onto his. Soon our bodies were a whirlwind of lustful grasping and tender kisses. I grabbed his hand and dragged him out of the door towards the rooms. I scanned the hallways for the first open door, then we barged our way in, uncaring for whose room we had just invaded with our raw lust.</p>
<p>We both set to work relieving me of my clothes, the fashionable dress I was wearing wholly unsuited of a fallen whore. I heard fabric tearing but didn't care as my clothes were just former status that needed shedding so I could become naked and subservient to the man who had just paid 19 shillings for my body.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before I was naked and knew my place, kneeling down in front of Wayne as he pulled his trousers and underwear down, freeing his hard penis so rapidly it bounced upwards in a way I would have found more comical if I hadn't been so consumed with carnal desire. Instead of laughing, I greedily stuffed his cock into my mouth.</p>
<p>It doesn't take an academic in full possession of her faculties (as I used to be) to know that the handle of a hairbrush is a very different thing to a penis. The final proof of this matter for myself was how much easier it was for me to slip the former down my throat. I was very thankful for the practice I had given myself, it allowed me to ensure for what seemed like some time before I found myself coughing and spluttering at Wayne's feet.</p>
<p>"You really 'aven't done this before 'ave you?" Wayne laughed as I got back onto my knees.</p>
<p>"Not even my husband gets to fuck my throat." I replied with a wide smile before once again forcing Wayne's cock into my mouth again.</p>
<p>After my second gurgling cough, Wayne decided to take the initiative. He pulled me up to my feet, planted a kiss on my lips, then pushed me onto the bed and took his position above me and between my legs. I was about to be violated and instead of dread I just felt a mania of anticipation.</p>
<p>"Do it, make me your whore." I ordered Wayne as I felt my lower lips begin to part to allow his relentlessly impending member to thrust inside of me. "Oh god yes, fuck this dirty whore."</p>
<p>Wayne began thrusting hard and fast, he had the muscles and stamina of a manual labourer and was able to deliver penetration far more powerful than my husband, the viscount. Each thrust sent shockwaves through my body, and I could tell from his conquering look that he was enjoying my ample breasts bouncing in rhythm to his violation. I swum in the raw physical pleasure, the deviancy of my actions, and the joy of providing someone else such enjoyment from my body, all layering on top of one another in a single disgracefully hedonistic act.</p>
<p>All cognisance disappeared from my mind as I surrendered to pleasure, I couldn't tell you how long it had been when I felt Wayne's cock pulse and fill my pussy with his sperm. What followed was a moment of deep breathing, no more thrusting, we simply lay connected, two people linked in the aftershocks of animalistic lust.</p>
<p>"I can't believe I just fucked a viscountess." Wayne sighed.</p>
<p>"I was a viscountess when you started, now I'm just a whore." I replied as he slipped out of me. I remained on my bed, his seed leaking out of me while he redressed. He took one look at the state he had left me in before disappearing with a skip in his step. After some time I decided what I wanted was more, I wanted to sell myself again and again. I stood up and standing in the doorway was Tallboy.</p>
<p>"You're still a woman of honour," he began, momentarily reassuring me. "So I will trust you to keep track of your partners and pay me my cut at the end of the night."</p>
<p>"How much do you..."</p>
<p>"50%. In the future use room 14, you're currently dripping on Tiffany's bed." He stated in a matter of fact way. He saw me looking down at my torn clothes and sighed. "I'll get you a replacement dress, I gave your nudity a pass last time but in general the rule is no nudity in the bar, it makes people less likely to pay for services."</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"When did you last bleed?" Tallboy asked without any sense of decorum.</p>
<p>"About three weeks ago." I impatiently replied, awaiting the dress that would allow me to re-enter the bar and begin charging for my body again.</p>
<p>"That's alright, one of the less risky times, I'd still recommend eating this stalk of silphium just to make extra certain I don't have an angry viscount breaking down my door and blaming me for your bastard." Tallboy explained, handing me a pungent green stalk that I forced myself to chew and swallow through the bitter spice while he left to fetch me an outfit.</p>
<p>The dress he returned with was probably a special one, very different from the casually loose ones I'd seen his other girls in. I had been presented with one that was probably more scandalous than being nude.</p>
<p>As I pulled it on I realised that the scarlet skirting was long and ruffled, except at the front where it was trimmed back so my legs were pretty much entirely on show. In the absence of bloomers the only thing keeping my vagina from being totally shown off was a single row of ruffles barely a hand width below my hip. The torso, at first, seemed well tailored with corsetry fairly easy to tighten, but as I pulled my body into it, I realised the fabric over my breasts was in fact a thick weaved lace that made my breasts look like they have been caught in a red spider's web.</p>
<p>There was no doubt, I was wearing this outfit to mark myself as one who had chosen exposure and sexualisation. I had put on a dress that no reputable woman would willingly wear. A naked woman could be embracing freedom, or the victim of calamity, or one of many reasons where her virtue remained intact. Wearing this dress had a singular explanation, that I was a sexual being, there to be contracted for sex.</p>
<p>I adjusted the dress and my attitude before hungrily venturing out of the room and back to the basement.</p>
<p>Eyes certainly turned as I walked into the room, I ensured I carried myself with the decorum of a lady just to really embrace the role the dress had cast me in, and before long a series of men were buying me drinks and asking the most impertinent questions.</p>
<p>'Which one should I take to bed?' I thought to myself, before correcting my thinking. 'which one should I take to bed first?'</p>
<p>I stirred from my stupor and growled at the sunlight and light breeze invading through the window and drying the semen crusting on parts of my exposed body. I got up and felt a slight rawness to my nethers, I was lucky that no man had insisted on anal, but my throat felt bruised from a fairly steep learning curve for my gag reflex that brought men no end of delight at my discomfort.</p>
<p>"Morning sleepyhead!" Tallboy chirped from the doorway of my room. "You were a whirlwind of perversion last night, did you keep track of how many men paid to fuck you?"</p>
<p>"Eight." I stammered. Tallboy didn't wait for my permission to begin rummaging through my coin purse to extract his cut.</p>
<p>"You didn't over or undercharge any of them did you? Bad things happen to whores who go off my valuation." Tallboy threatened.</p>
<p>"No." I barely replied.</p>
<p>"Good, so that's 3 pounds and 16 shillings each, how do you feel having finally earned your money?" He asked taking a handful of coins from my pouch.</p>
<p>My response was a barely audible gurgle.</p>
<p>"Our in house seamstress didn't have the time or skill to do a full repair on your dress, but it should at least hold until you get home." Tallboy explained as he handed me the pile of fabrics that had been a respectable dress at the start of the night. "Hopefully your husband should be out of the house by now."</p>
<p>I had gotten home, cleaned myself up, and changed into a dress that hadn't been torn off in a state of rabid ravishment by the time my husband returned home for a browbeating of intense ferocity, but far less than what I deserved. The focus of his anger was that I had left to study a brothel and was not back in bed by his awakening. He was mainly worried about the wagging tongues of the royal court, I wondered if any story they concocted would be half as scandalous as the truth.</p>
<p>I lied and told him I had made a breakthrough and had spent most of the night commandeering an office to interview a prostitute who could not work as it was a dangerous point in her cycle. His mood soured again when I told him this would likely lead to many more overnight interviews with working girls who couldn't work.</p>
<p>His palpable anger ended with me banished to sleep in a guest room that night, which was fine by me as I wished to spend some time languishing in the sexual cocoon I was now in, wondering what kind of fetishistic butterfly would come out the other side.</p>
<p>I hadn't touched the library, or written a word of my thesis, or even talked to another academic since that night, I had simply waited a day to recover before eagerly returning to Tallboy's building, hungry for another night of debauchery. Tallboy intercepted me at the door, he clearly wanted a word first.</p>
<p>"I had an idea." He announced with much aplomb. "You made a bit of money last night, no doubt about it, but I noticed you received far more attention earlier in the nights, when you were more haughty taughty viscountess than a violated sex slave."</p>
<p>I didn't know where he was going with this, but it couldn't be good.</p>
<p>"So I figured I'd produce these promotional materials for you." Tallboy handed me a stack of papers, fresh from a printing press he had somehow managed to commission. What was presented to me was a poster that could not have been cheap to produce, it looked incredibly authentic considering it was a fabrication of an official proclamation document that could get whatever printer produced it into quite severe trouble.</p>
<p>'By order of His Imperial Majesty King Harold IV: Viscountess Melody of Montague (pictured below) is here on official academic business for the king and is not to be disturbed in said business. She is a virtuous and chaste woman, and her proximity to the morally deficient is no reason to treat her as such. Anyone caught treating her as anything other than an upstanding respectable woman of nobility will be subject to harsh penalties.'</p>
<p>"Are you sure threatening people with a punishment is the best way to encourage them to fuck me?" I asked, all sense of resistance or decorum long lost.</p>
<p>"Oh that's easy, you see the boys and I have already been putting these up over town, so it's already well established what you look like and who you are. I figured you could personally hand out these remaining proclamations in front of the building. And just in case anyone gets the wrong idea, I think you shouldn't be wearing any clothes when you do it." Tallboy explained, drinking in my shock at the twist at the end.</p>
<p>"What if someone I know comes round?" I gasped.</p>
<p>"I have only ever seen one member of the aristocracy in cheapside, and she's stood right in front of me. Nobody with even a hint of wealth visits this area, I'm certain nobody from your other life will see you." Tallboy calmly surmised.</p>
<p>"But I'd be exposed, someone could do awful things to me."</p>
<p>"Not without paying 19 shillings they won't, and I'll have one of my most sadistic men keep an eye on you just in case someone feels like stealing from me." Tallboy elaborated, I knew I should have felt a bit silly worrying about a virtue that was already gone, but what I actually felt was the deep sense of dread at his framing of the situation. To sleep with me without paying up was stealing from him. He now fully considered me his property, I tried to find another objection to raise but his increasingly less jovial stare informed me that he was getting impatient with his property speaking back to him. So right there, in the middle of the street, I stripped down until I was naked.</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>Tallboy scooped my clothes off the floor and held them under his arm.</p>
<p>"You may not return until you have handed out every single poster you are currently holding, and if you even think about throwing any away, if even one falls from your hand to the ground, I'll be keeping these clothes and you can walk back to your beloved viscount like this." He ordered before slamming the door behind him and leaving me naked and alone in the busy street.</p>
<p>At first I simply cowered, pressed the posters to my chest hoping that through sheer force of will I would no longer be there. When I opened my eyes the street was the same and I was still naked. There were a few people walking by, all locals who knew the deal with this place and so although eyes would linger, bodies would keep moving. Knowing that this nightmare wouldn't end until I had fulfilled Tallboy's instructions, I took a deep breath, stepped into the street, and began handing out posters.</p>
<p>The worst part of this whole ordeal, was that to give someone a poster, I first had to catch their attention. Every time I would yell "good sir" or "excuse me" I would have to watch them turn, look me up and down, then make direct eye contact with someone who had just seen my most embarrassing form. I would hand them a poster, professing me a virtuous and morally upstanding viscountess, then move on to the next member of the public.</p>
<p>At first the by-standers simply took the poster and moved on after a moment of gawking, but a large bearded man decided to break convention by stopping me to ask questions.</p>
<p>"Wait, is that you? Are you a viscountess?" He asked, looking me up and down.</p>
<p>"I am." I stated, hoping this would be enough to get him to move on. He did not.</p>
<p>"Why is a viscountess parading her naked body in the poor part of town?" He asked, now placing his hand on my waist.</p>
<p>"I was sent here to study prostitutes, and I ended up being tricked into becoming one." I explained as his hand began to wander onto my bottom.</p>
<p>"So how much would it cost me to fuck a blue blooded girl like you?" His hands were now roaming my body and I was doing nothing to stop him.</p>
<p>"19 shillings, but you would have to wait until I have finished handing out my posters." I moaned. "How about you go inside and have a drink and I'll join you shortly?"</p>
<p>"Or how about since you're already naked in the streets begging for cock..." He began, his hands now taking a firmer grip on my body. "I go ahead and save myself 19 shillings and just..."</p>
<p>This man's dark desires on my body were abruptly curtailed by his loud shriek as his hands were forcibly removed from my body and placed in a position that looked incredibly uncomfortable by a wiry yet fearsome man whose grin only grew at the sound of his screams.</p>
<p>"Now, you weren't planning on stealing from Tallboy were you?" He rhetorically asked with a menacing grin.</p>
<p>"Oh no, of course not, sorry I didn't realise she belonged to Tallboy." The man began whimpering, discussing me like I had no agency of my own, a doll that needed her owner to assert his rights over her.</p>
<p>"Very good, now you better fuck off quickly or I'm going to get 19 shillings worth of fun out of you." He threatened. My would be attacker fled down the street and the protector of Tallboy's property once again melted into the shadows, content the message has been received by others on the street.</p>
<p>It took me a moment to regain my composure before I once again began handing out posters to passersby, now very eager to take one a keep moving lest they attract the ire of the clearly dangerous man watching on from the sidelines.</p>
<p>I was about three quarters done with my task when the sun began to set. I had received the odd squeeze here and there, and felt thoroughly humiliated, but I had become comfortable and even a little proud showing off my body to strangers, allowing them to behold that which the posters proclaimed was so forbidden.</p>
<p>A large group of men approached and I saw an opportunity to get shot of a lot of these posters in one go. The men were clearly preparing for a night of boisterous entertainment and my approach was greeted with cheers and catcalls.</p>
<p>"Here you go gentlemen, before you ask, that is indeed me on the posters." I announced, placing one into each man's hands.</p>
<p>"Fucking hell, this whore's nobility." One man yelled, gathering the rest of his group to take some posters and once again examine subject my body to lustful examination.</p>
<p>"She sure is, you can tell all your friends that you got to see a viscountess' tits." I quipped, drinking in the feel of their eyes on my breasts.</p>
<p>"And how much is it to tell my friends I fucked a viscountess?" One of the men asked.</p>
<p>"19 shillings, you just have to wait inside for me to finish handing out these posters." I informed, desperately hoping they would obey the rules. I saw a malevolent glint in a couple of their eyes, but some more familiar with the neighbourhood knew better of it and advised against such shenanigans.</p>
<p>"Alright, we'll meet you inside." One of the men announced.</p>
<p>"Delightful!" I cheered. The man who had made the announcement stepped forward and roughly grabbed my breasts, eliciting a moan of delight from me before turning to head inside. The other men in his group all followed suit, roughly grabbing and groping me in turn before heading inside to hungrily wait for my body.</p>
<p>I practically threw the last two posters at passersby and eagerly headed towards the door, only to have my way blocked by the same scary man who, up until this point, had been my protector.</p>
<p>"Tallboy said you'd be paying me for my services." He informed with transparent malice.</p>
<p>"Very well, just let me in and I'll grab my coin pouch." I reasoned.</p>
<p>"Tallboy said you're not allowed in until you've paid your debt." He explained, his grin getting wider. "We were out here a bit longer than an hour, but as I'm feeling generous I'll round down and just charge you 1 pound."</p>
<p>"Where am I supposed to..." I began, but then realised exactly what this was about, Tallboy wanted me to be a back alley slut before I could come back in. "Very well."</p>
<p>I took to the street with a new mission, to find someone willing to fuck me in public for a pound. Luckily enough one of the posters I had handed out was discarded on the floor and I was able to pick it up and use it as my main selling point.</p>
<p>"One pound to fuck a viscountess." I appealed to people in the street. Before I had been coy and shy, drawing people's attention with my nudity. Now I had switched to a more blunt appeal, I saw the looks of disgust that crossed the faces of the people in the street. If I wanted to be fucked I would need a new plan.</p>
<p>I placed my poster upon a wall and then simply stood next to it, trying to catch men's eyes and encourage them to come to me. Like a fisherman working with extra appealing bait, it didn't take me long to reel in a good prospect, a shirtless man whose muscles spoke to a tough job in manual labour.</p>
<p>"You really a viscountess?" He grunted at me.</p>
<p>"Viscountess Melody of Montague. Aristocrat turned whore." I replied, taking the initiative and moving his calloused hands onto my body.</p>
<p>"You got debts or something? Why's a fancy lady like you selling her body like this?" He asked.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you what, for just one pound, you can take me down this back alley and fuck my brains out, then, once you've thoroughly destroyed my virtue, I'll tell you why I'm now a whore." I whispered in his ear. The man rummaged through his pockets and pulled out 4 distinct coins, each worth a crown (5 shillings), and jingled them in front of me. I took his hand and led him away from the busy street.</p>
<p>I never realised the unique thrill that having sex in an alleyway would provide. Once we had taken enough steps that the foot traffic was now a distant rumble, I bent over and placed my hands on the wall, wiggling my bottom in anticipation like a bitch ready to have a litter of puppies pumped into her. He grabbed my hips and thrust himself inside me, without any foreplay or beating around the bush, we became two mongrel dogs rutting on the street.</p>
<p>Every so often I would look to one side and see people going about their day while I was abjectly debased and used. Eventually my conqueror got tired of me constantly checking to see if we had attracted an audience and opted to pull my hair hard. My back arched upwards and his penis began to grind against my insides in new and exciting ways. Eventually I felt the telltale twitch of a cock about to cum, I pulled him out of me, whipped my body around, and kneeled in submission as I massaged his seed out of his penis and onto my face and tits.</p>
<p>We both groaned in ecstatic fulfilment and then he sat next to me to catch his breath.</p>
<p>"So, why are you doing this then?" He asked, handing me four crowns.</p>
<p>"At first, it was because I was tricked. But now, it's because I fucking love being a whore." I replied, taking his money and making my way towards Tallboy's building where I knew new clients were waiting inside.</p>
<p>I opted to go to my room and wash the cum off me before heading down to the basement. I knew I would have to swing by Tallboy's office to get my dress back so was just hoping that the men I had met in the street would be patient for me. As I emerged from the water closet freshly rinsed, I saw Tallboy in my room, the fearsome guard at his side.</p>
<p>"I know your brain was a bit cock-addled at the time, but do you remember what I told you when I was collecting my cut yesterday?" Tallboy asked, his words holding back no small amount of rage.</p>
<p>"We split everything fifty fifty." I replied, confused. "Sorry I needed to pay him to get in, I'll give you your cut after my next fuck."</p>
<p>"That's not the objection I have. I told you that you are a 19 shilling whore, that means you are worth 19 shillings. Yesterday I told you bad things happen to women who charge different to my valuation, now I hear you swindled a customer out of an extra shilling."</p>
<p>"Shit, sorry I..."</p>
<p>"I don't want to hear your cock holster flapping any more." Tallboy interrupted. "When you charge differently to my valuation, it hits my reputation, as people will think I misjudged you as a one pound hooker when you are a 19 shilling hooker. Am I clear?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm so..."</p>
<p>"We have an established punishment for girls who charge more than their valuation. It is there to teach them the value of a reputation. Simply put it is the confiscation of everything they own, so they are left with only their reputation." He reached down and plucked my earrings from my ears, and handed them to his muscle, who I noticed was also holding my coin purse and some knick knacks that I had been keeping in my room. "From now on, if you want your things back, you have to earn it from me."</p>
<p>"Fine, I'll go earn some money right now." I announced.</p>
<p>"You are really bad at remembering the rules aren't you? You got to wear clothes to go to the basement and get business."</p>
<p>"How much for my dress?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Two pounds." He announced.</p>
<p>"And how am I supposed to earn that if I'm not allowed to go into the basement?" I asked petulantly.</p>
<p>"Same way you earned passage into my building. Go be a back alley whore until you have 2 pounds. And don't forget, I take a 50% cut of your earnings, so I'm not going to be handing over your dress until you hand me 4 pounds." He explained before chuckling as he walked away.</p>
<p>His fearsome enforcer began leading me towards the door, charged with not letting me go into the basement in this condition.</p>
<p>"How about you? I'm sure you have 19 shillings to spare to start my dress fund." I asked, hoping to get a head start on earning back my things.</p>
<p>"You're not my type." He bluntly acknowledged.</p>
<p>"Seriously, I'm a viscountess, what would I have to be to be your type?" I shot back.</p>
<p>"A viscount." He replied, cutting the conversation abruptly short.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, while I was being shepherded towards the door, one of the men in the big group that was awaiting me had left the basement to use the latrine and ended up catching my eye.</p>
<p>"Good sir, please inform your friends that tonight I am a back alley slut, if they want to fuck a viscountess, they are to meet me in the alleyway next to this building with 19 shillings." I yelled as I was ushered out of the door and into the street.</p>
<p>I had barely made it to the spot I had spoiled moments ago when I heard the small roar of a crowd of men heading in my direction.</p>
<p>For the second time I awoke to the morning sun, covered in violation and deviancy, only this time I was in the street outside the building, in full view of any person who happened to look down the alleyway that was far less darkened than it had been the night before. I was still leaking semen from my pussy, with sticky degeneracy clinging to my skin and coming off in flakes as I arose and found myself running back into Tallboy's establishment before anyone could alert my disgraceful presence to the authorities, if they hadn't done so already.</p>
<p>I was lucky that the men had been good to their word and paid me appropriately. (I didn't know that Tallboy had threatened them to do so as they left his premises.) There had been 8 men in total, and they had each put in so that I was running back clutching 7 pounds and 12 shillings.</p>
<p>I gave Tallboy his cut, then I spent 2 pounds on my dress, 1 pound on my shoes, and kept the remaining 16 shillings as it wasn't enough to purchase back my earrings. I snatched my dress out of his hands and retreated to my house.</p>
<p>Tallboy was surprised to see me back the very same day, at first he was worried that I had taken direct action against his latest expansion of power, after all if I chose to I could certainly still make his life very difficult, instead I handed him my attache.</p>
<p>Tallboy was confused as he opened up the attache and found a huge pile of paper, a variety of jewellery and other knick knacks, and a very full coin pouch.</p>
<p>"I am sorry I disobeyed your rule, deep down I think I forgot my place, that when you gave me a valuation I became your property. So I went home and made account of all of my belongings. My husband gives me a monthly allowance, what remains of this month is contained in that coin pouch as well as all my remaining savings. Anything not in that bag is itemised on the the list included, along with my word that I will not use any of what are now your possessions, without first paying you for them. You will notice I have put a price next to each item, that is how much they are worth with an additional fee of 50% to account for the trouble I have caused you. If you wish to take physical possession of anything on that list I will make the appropriate arrangements."</p>
<p>I must have looked like such an insane bitch to him, he scanned my itinerary, my life that was now his, and gawped at the full extent of my self-subjugation.</p>
<p>The hairbrush I had diligently used to train my body would cost me 1 pound and 10 shillings if I wanted to get it back, and it was needed for my new life. Each and every dress I owned would remain hung in the closet until the ransom I decided had been paid, the damaged and cum stained outfit from last night currently the only covering I was currently allowed, not to mention my complete lack of underwear, which were being held hostage until I bought them back with my body. As luck would have it the house I lived in belonged to my husband, but if I wanted to sleep on the bed in the spare bedroom (where I was spending increasingly more nights), I would first have to fuck at least 30 men, each pillow would need 4 men to punish my pussy and the blanket would cost 14 violations to my body.</p>
<p>Then there were the day to day things I needed to succeed in my other life. If I wanted to use the academy library, I would first have to buy back my library membership by allowing 7 men to violate me. Parchment was coming out a one fuck a ream and I would need to fuck a man for every 3 quills I went through. By the terms of my punishment I didn't feel like my academy paycheque would need to automatically go to Tallboy, but it seemed like it would probably end up that way to buy back more and more of my life.</p>
<p>Then there were the deepest and most personal things I owned. I would need to fuck 3 men just to afford my childhood cuddly toy. My wedding ring was in the bag, if I didn't want my husband to get suspicious, I better make 25 men cum. I even included a lock of my mother's hair contained in a silver locket, my only keepsake from the late woman who raised me and loved me, now in the hands of a pimp until I fucked 15 men.</p>
<p>And then there were the most extravagantly expensive things I owned. The family estate in coastal Norfolk, passed down through generations, practically priceless, but I valued it at 1321 fucks. The landscape painting by renowned artist Gustav Murdoch, a steal at only 526 fucks. My wedding dress, silkwork that took a dozen masters months to complete, now in the possession of a pimp until I can give him the proceeds from 715 violations of the chastity it once represented. These were not items I was ever likely to be able to buy back, but a promise of my perpetual sexual indentitude.</p>
<p>The whole charade was a smidge hollow, if I changed my mind on the whole deal there wasn't much Tallboy could do to assert his rights to the property I had just pledged to him. It wasn't like we had signed contracts (and even if we had I would certainly be able to claim duress to any of the judges that my husband was friends with). It was a dangerous fantasy, but a fantasy nonetheless.</p>
<p>"Very well." Tallboy acknowledged, scarcely believing the good fortune I had just delivered to him. "You only have a couple of days until you're due to bleed again, so you better get to work if you want enough possessions to pass as a viscountess for those days."</p>
<p>"I have to be honest, since you took up this area of study, you have gradually begun acting more and more peculiar." The viscount observed as I nursed the porridge in front of me. I was housebound for a couple of days while my time of the month sorted itself out and it had thrown a spotlight on my unusual behaviour. I still hadn't earned Tallboy enough money to buy back my bed so I had taken to sleeping on the floor in the spare room as the viscount didn't like sharing a bed with me while I was bleeding.</p>
<p>"I have been working hard to be free of this assignment so we can get back to our lives" I lied, "sorry if my sleep deprivation is making me a bit cranky."</p>
<p>"It's not just your behaviour, it's things that are starting to be noticed around the court. They've noticed you are no longer wearing your ring."</p>
<p>"I was told it would be at risk of being stolen in the deprived neighbourhood so I put it in with the jewellers for its clean and polish early this year." I continued to lie.</p>
<p>"You have a wardrobe full of dresses, but you've been wearing the same two for a week now and they are filthy." He continued to complain.</p>
<p>"Last night I collapsed asleep at my desk and this morning I woke up and began working all over again. I know tongues will wag but I'm working hard and soon it will be done. My report will be presented to the king himself, my standing will skyrocket but only if I give him something amazing, otherwise I will drop out of favour so badly and you can be sure that will be worse for you than a few weeks of me looking a bit dishevelled."</p>
<p>I saw him doing the calculations in his head, now I was speaking his language, all concerns for my wellbeing could be put on hold if his future status could be enhanced. I had indeed been working very hard on my paper, simply because if I got a head of steam on my official duties, I would have more free time to sell my body to strangers, the novelty of which had not yet worn off and I longed to return to when my time of the month was over.</p>

<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>"Very well, but go change into one of your clean dresses in case we have company."</p>
<p>"Welcome back, you ready for 2 weeks of constant sex to start earning back your stuff?" Tallboy announced with aplomb as I walked through the door to his office. At first I thought he had forgotten the regularity of a woman's cycle, but then I remembered he would take women out of work in the most dangerous times for impregnation.</p>
<p>"Indeed I am, but before I start I have a question about your punishments." I began. Tallboy grinned as such a line of enquiry would be good for him. "The situation got away from me and I was forced to wear a dress I had not yet purchased back from you, all things considered I feel the only appropriate way forward is that you give me the punishment you reserve for women who steal from you."</p>
<p>"I'm not going to give you the punishment for women who steal from me because it is more violent than would be prudent for our current arrangement. But I agree you deserve punishment for breaking the rules." He agreed, stopping to get lost in thought over what would be suitable. "Tiffany, can you come in here a minute?"</p>
<p>At his bidding one of the prostitutes appeared at his side. I made a desperate note of her face to finally remember which girl was called Tiffany.</p>
<p>"Tell the girls we have a dick cleaner on duty tonight." He informed before sending Tiffany away again and turning to explain to me. "Take off your dress, you won't need it."</p>
<p>As I stripped down he went and fetched a quill. Once naked in front of him, he wrote the words 'dick cleaner' in big letters across my chest.</p>
<p>"Dick cleaning duty is simple." He began as he took out some manacles and began fastening my wrist behind my back. "You roam the halls listening out for any girl who calls for your services. Then you use your mouth to clean off the man's dick. This could be a less than hygienic man that they want cleaned up for them, or it could be a man who's just finished having sex who wants all those disgusting fluids removed from his cock. Either way tonight you will not get paid a penny while you serve this establishment."</p>
<p>"That is a fair punishment, thank you."</p>
<p>"Oh, and when you get home tonight, throw away the dress you wore. I want it to be clear that any time you use something of mine, you better be prepared to never see it again." He threatened as she showed me towards the door and into the hallway.</p>
<p>I was halfway through my first deep breath when I heard the first call of my time.</p>
<p>"Dick Cleaner!" Echoed through the hallway and I followed the sound to its source.</p>
<p>"Are you distracted?" Professor Sutcliffe asked, breaking through my stupor. I shook my head but I was indeed distracted. I had gone to meet my supervisor straight after my session as a dick cleaner, the disgraceful marking of my new role still graced my chest underneath my dress, and the taste of filthy cocks still lingered in my mouth. I would barely hear the start of his sentences before reverting to memories of the previous night.</p>
<p>"The calculations rely on other businesses operating in a similar..." he began before my mind drifted to licking a mixture of semen and Tiffany's juices off a cock in a state of post-coital flaccidness.</p>
<p>"The personal stories are much better though, these poor women..." I would catch before my mind was back to cleaning the day's filth of a farmer's penis so Bernadette's cunt would not be dirtied by his affections.</p>
<p>"The librarian says you are still..." I would notice before once again recalling memories of a girl calling me over to clean off the dicks of men who had just finished relieving themselves, the dribbles of urine a unique taste that mixed with the others in my mouth.</p>
<p>"There is one interesting development, in terms of words of your exploits reaching the king's ear." I was able to snap out of my stupor for this point. "I don't know what you are doing in the poorer areas of town, but you are becoming something of a folk hero. Word has reached the king that locals believe you to be the only aristocrat who truly understands their struggles."</p>
<p>I suppressed a giggle, it looks like the poor area of town was no stranger to wagging tongues, but they had decided to have a joke at the upper class's expense, and I had become the punchline.</p>
<p>"There is now a great deal of interest in your paper, and the Lord High Admiral's face goes crimson whenever it is mentioned. You have somehow carved out a niche as champion of cheapside. The king wants you to pose for a portrait with his painter laureate that can be copied and distributed so other nobles can be part of the good graces you have earned with the downtrodden."</p>
<p>My mind wandered into what kind of portrait it would have to be to truly show the truth of the matter. Thoughts turned to my disgraced body on every high class wall in the kingdom and once again the taste of cock in my mouth drew my attention away from the discussion.</p>
<p>"Melody!" He yelled, commanding my attention now. "I've seen this before, you're working so hard on this paper that you're neglecting yourself. After this meeting you should go home and get a good night's sleep."</p>
<p>I wanted to tell him that in order to get a good night's sleep, I would still have to fuck 8 more men to buy back my bed.</p>
<p>It had been a fortnight of whirlwind pleasure. I worked it out, I spent more time with a man inside of me then I spent in the same room as husband. On a good nights I could have over 10 different men fuck me. A week in I started getting fucked in the ass, at first it hurt but through repetition I began to love it almost as much as when my pussy was violated.</p>
<p>I was beginning to once again get comfortable now that I had paid off some of my possessions, both through the sale of my body and the immediate funnelling of my allowance and academic pay to Tallboy.</p>
<p>I turned up to work with a big grin on my face, but Tallboy was at the door to meet me. He shepherded me into his office to talk business.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you're off now, silphium can only do so much when you're at this point in your cycle." Tallboy announced.</p>
<p>"No! I need to keep working." I protested, not even stopping to reminisce about how far my morals had recently fallen. "How about I switch to blow jobs and anal only?"</p>
<p>"You're alright with that? At your last valuation you could barely tickle your tonsils with collapsing into a gagging mess on my floor and we didn't even test your ass." Tallboy mused.</p>
<p>"Well a lot has changed in the last couple of weeks." I hungrily replied.</p>
<p>"In which case, I think it's time we had another valuation." Tallboy responded. I immediately overflowed with joy. Not only was this a chance to prove myself more valuable, it was an opportunity to quantify how much better a sex object I had become since I started selling my body. No sooner had he finished the sentence then I was immediately and clumsily wrestling my clothes off my body to present myself for Tallboy's inspection.</p>
<p>"A lot more eager than before, that's good. You've been keeping your body clean and your pussy shaven" Tallboy noted as he once again began rounding my body, eying up every inch of my exposed flesh. "Lost a small amount of weight since last time. Guessing that's the constant labour and inability to afford meals."</p>
<p>Tallboy grabbed my breasts and I moaned under his attention.</p>
<p>"Tits are still huge and firm though." Next he grabbed my ass and kneaded my cheeks. "But now your bottom is also firming up. A lot more thigh exercise riding cocks."</p>
<p>Tallboy walked over to his drawer and pulled out the wooden phallus that was so daunting last time, handing it to me expectantly. I gave him a cheeky wink then let him watch me swallow it without any struggles, fishing it out to hand it back to him.</p>
<p>"That tiny thing is surely for beginners right? I wonder if you have something more testing I can prove myself on?" I rhetorically asked, blatantly staring at Tallboy's trousers.</p>
<p>"I don't mix business and pleasure." He asserted, for the first time ever looking out of his comfort zone. I saw the growing tent in his trousers and suddenly that's all I could think of.</p>
<p>"I can understand that with the other girls, they might leverage it to take advantage of you or gain the upper hand. But we both know I love belonging to you, being your hooker. If I wanted things to change I have a myriad of other ways to do that. So you know it's on the level when I say I want your cock down my throat for no reason other than to show you what a great whore I am." I reasoned. Tallboy's resistance was melting away as I took the initiative to begin undoing his trousers and sliding them down his legs.</p>
<p>What I revealed was a marvel, Tallboy was a big man and everything was in proportion. A grin crossed over his face as he saw my momentary trepidation. It only drove him on and he thrust himself forward as I did all I could to accommodate the giant cock I had goaded into life.</p>
<p>I have no idea how, but I somehow managed to swallow the cock and began thrusting my neck back and forward, gagging and spluttering but at no point letting up on ensuring every one of the multitude of inches Tallboy possessed was accommodated. After what seemed like more than enough time, Tallboy pulled out of me, giving me no small sense of triumph.</p>
<p>"It's a good throat isn't it? How about you move on to testing my pussy." I begged, turning away from Tallboy, bending over, and parting myself invitingly. I once again took a deep measure of joy in luring Tallboy out of his senses, I couldn't imagine many whores had ever achieved what I had as I felt his enormous cock begin to fill me. Then he began thrusting and it felt I was being forcibly turned inside out. My body rocked and wrecked with sinful penetration, I had been fucking a lot of men for my master, but his cock was the largest I had endured so far and the tiny amount of pain from my stretching provided a silver frame for the glorious pleasure I felt being thoroughly impaled.</p>
<p>Tallboy didn't get to have sex often with his policy of not mixing business and pleasure, this meant that it didn't take long for him to climax, and when he did I felt my pussy fill with more semen than I thought possible for one man to produce. I collapsed on the floor, dripping and weak as Tallboy pulled up his trousers.</p>
<p>"That was a mistake." He stated, coming back to his senses.</p>
<p>"Won't hear me complaining." I giggled.</p>
<p>"Alright, so your valuation is as follows, your new price is a pound and a crown. You won't be working for the next five days because you now have homework of going home and fucking your husband as many times as he can muster. You're in the danger zone and I'll be damned if I'm having a viscount bashing down my door with his military and political clout asking how his wife got pregnant when she's never at home and always here." Tallboy instructed.</p>
<p>It was a lot of information to take in at once. I had gotten 6 shillings better at sex, an improvement of 31.5%. I certainly would have liked to bask in that achievement but instead I was now looking in shock at what I had been ordered. I had just been told to go and try my level best to get pregnant, and I was still dripping with the seed of the man who had just ordered me.</p>
<p>"Very well." I replied, getting dressed and making plans for when I got home.</p>
<p>What followed was five agonising, frustrating, horrible days. Five days where I had a supercharged lebido while my husband needed to be coaxed into sex like a frightened mouse. I assured him I wouldn't go back to the whorehouse for a couple of days so if I were impregnated we could point to conception in a period where I wasn't surrounded by those of low morals. Even then any mention of prostitution, deviancy, or even how pleasurable sex was would cause him to shrink back into his shell and his penis to soften faster than grains poured into boiling soup. I spent a week walking a tightrope of desire and it was exhausting.</p>
<p>One weapon that I had at my disposal was the wagging tongues of the court had been steered in my favour by the endless stories coming out of the poor areas of town about my humility and charity. The posters Tallboy had printed and I had distributed (naked) had become a poor person's portrait of virtue, something to display in your house in reverence to noble Viscountess Melody of Montague and her mission to lift the lives of the poor. Suddenly everyone wanted to be on my good side, and in my absence my husband became a proxy and was certainly enjoying the attention. My long hours away didn't even bother him any more as it forced the court to engage with him, increased his political capital, and continued to solidify my saintly reputation.</p>
<p>I managed to spare a day to sit for my portrait, the artist and I agreed that while portraits are usually commissioned to show off wealth and status, this should forswear extravagance to show off my humility. I carefully tried to push more and more sexualised ideas, such as my figure in rags similar to the poor, or a lighter lace on my dress with hints of my anatomy showing through, but in the end the artist decided on a modern twist on the yellow flowing robes Mary Magdalene was often depicted in.</p>
<p>Nonetheless after five days I was able to present myself to Tallboy, pressing 2 pounds and 10 shillings into his hand.</p>
<p>"Your cut." I announced.</p>
<p>"Wait, did you charge your husband for sex?"</p>
<p>"Not directly, I took the money when he wasn't looking, but it's important that only my owner gets to fuck me for free. The viscount is just another John to me now." I explained.</p>
<p>"Alright then, heroine of cheapside, your adoring public awaits your pussy." Tallboy announced with sarcastic fanfare as he edged me out of his office and towards the basement where clients were waiting.</p>
<p>As with any new and thrilling thing, the excitement couldn't last forever, selling my body soon went from a thrill, to a pleasant way to live my life, to a monotony. Men rarely wanted to do anything more adventurous than fuck me, and it didn't take me long to pay off all the debts it was practical to pay off. I was considering breaking some more rules, inviting the wrath of Tallboy down upon me again, but fate intervened with a new source of excitement before I could.</p>
<p>"You're pregnant!" Tallboy exclaimed.</p>
<p>"You of all people should probably not be surprised." I calmly retorted.</p>
<p>"But how do you know?"</p>
<p>"I have not had my time of the month for 2 weeks since it was due, and my physician says my urine is reacting with wine in a way he would expect from one with child." I explained.</p>
<p>"And your husband is certain that the baby is his, I'm not going to get in trouble for this." Tallboy rambled in a panic that I had to calm him from.</p>
<p>"Mr. Tallboy, you are my owner, you are the first one I have told as you have to make plans for your property. But don't worry, when my cuck husband gets the news, I will ensure there is no doubt in his mind of his parentage." I reassured.</p>
<p>"Then what?" He asked.</p>
<p>"Well, in 9 months time, I'm going to need some time off, so you're going to have to think creatively about what I can do to earn myself that break." I suggested.</p>
<p>"Alright then, you go home and tell your husband the good news. I'm going to put together some plans." Tallboy replied, regaining his composure.</p>
<p>It is amazing how much attitudes can change over time. After a month or two of morning sickness and lethargy, my presence at Tallboy's premises became less frequent, and I didn't hear a word of protest from him.</p>
<p>I was able to finish my paper, His Imperial Majesty sent me an official announcement of commendation in an amount of time that assured me that he hadn't read it, and a sizable bonus payment that entirely went to Tallboy. With my paper done I no longer had an excuse to make regular trips into cheapside, yet the prolonged absence this sparked did nothing to extract any passion from Tallboy.</p>
<p>When I did eventually make excuses about ongoing charitable support to those I met during my research, my husband barely questioned it as my ongoing presence only enhanced my reputation as champion of the poor and heroine of the destitute. However when I returned to Tallboy, eager to once again sell my body, he was filled with concern for my unborn child and wanted to protect me from stress or harm. I suppose part of being someone's possession is being protected, like fine china that was only bought out on special occasions. I confirmed with the other women that this treatment was not usual for working girls who found themselves pregnant.</p>
<p>Instead Tallboy started treating me as a partner. I would be on his arm as he went to various pubs and outings with his friends, bragging to them how he snagged a viscountess. Sometimes he'd not be in the mood for sex and begrudgingly let me work but more commonly he'd fuck me then let me go home to my husband.</p>
<p>Right there and then I decided that I would need to plan something for myself. What was the point of my descent into deviancy, if it was just the mechanism by which I went from being one man's wife to another.</p>
<p>I showed him the poster and his reaction was a mixture of shock and disagreement.</p>
<p>'Parade in celebration of Viscountess Melody of Montague.' The poster was entitled, detailing plans I had spent a month organising both with wealthy members of the aristocracy and influential members of the community in the poor side of town. 'The heroine of Cheapside has submitted her recommendations on prostitution to His Imperial Majesty the King, and he will soon be enacting its recommendations. Furthermore she has received the glorious news that she is to be a mother and wishes to share her joy with the downtrodden she has sworn to help.'</p>
<p>"So you are to spend our money, parading yourself around the most poor and dangerous area of the city. I don't think I have the resources to defend you if you do this." He objected.</p>
<p>"That is partially the point. I have planned and organised this all on my own. I know what will happen and most importantly I will get what I want out of it." I replied.</p>
<p>"But you are with my child, you can't just go galavanting off...."</p>
<p>"I can and I will if I choose." I interrupted.</p>
<p>"But you are my woman."</p>
<p>"Well yes I am." I soothed, kissing him on the cheek. "And I chose to be that because you respected me enough not to protect me from my choices, to let me live my life my way and assist where you could. Keep that going, and we can return to our old arrangement after the parade."</p>
<p>He was stunned by my sudden outspokenness, but knew better than to cross me when my mind was clearly made up. He didn't know it wasn't the first time that day I had engaged in pretty much this identical conversation.</p>
<p>I awkwardly sat in my carriage, a modest black single horse buggy, adorned with flowers and crete paper bunting. I did not feel awkward about the adoring crowds that surrounded me, or the increasingly large baby bump, or even my modest maternity dress and ill fitting but elegant shoes. What made me awkward was that when word got around about my parade, every aristocrat trying to stay ahead of popular rebellions decided to get on board. This meant that although the parade was for me, my buggy was the smallest in the procession, and the reigns of the horse that drove it were held by my husband sat next to me.</p>
<p>I had such deviant designs for this parade, but as long as a legion of aristocrats each with their personal guards squatted in attendance, there were certainly no opportunities to bespoil myself as I had planned.</p>
<p>"This is lovely, I'm glad I agreed to it." The viscount chuckled, as if he has any right to claim any credit for this parade. "Children are dancing in the street, cheering your name. People are waving flags and banners. Earlier I even saw a poster that spoke to how virtuous you are."</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>I must confess I felt bad that my initial plans had me doing unspeakable things by now and many of the children would have seen it, but I would rather that than the current situation in which my designs would be thoroughly unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Every so often the parade would stop, then lurch back into action, my husband whipping our poor white horse forward as it whinnied around its copper bit. I wondered what could be causing the commotion but not enough for it to intrude in my thoughts otherwise occupied by the disappointment of the day.</p>
<p>As the parade went on, soon the summer sun began to get low in the sky, and the children thinned as they went home for bed. The stopping and starting of the parade become more frequent and eventually a guardsman approached our carriage.</p>
<p>"Ma'am, I'm afraid the crowd is getting more and more restless." He reported.</p>
<p>"Well at the risk of sounding overly blunt, I can see why. There is a strong anti-aristocracy tendency amongst the poor and when they finally get behind one, several others impose themselves on the celebration."</p>
<p>"Honey!" My husband admonished before my hardened stare could subdue him.</p>
<p>"This is why the original plan was just myself, and a naval unit I commandeered for guard duty that were not formally aligned with a noble household." I explained.</p>
<p>"That's as may be, but it is our opinion that the parade has become too dangerous for us to proceed. The participants agree that we should end the parade early." As he explained his position, I saw an opportunity.</p>
<p>"Anti-aristocracy sentiment will only heighten if other nobles prematurely end the whole parade because the crowd are venting their frustrations about them highjacking it. So I need you to bring my word to the others. I encourage then to leave, they should only be slowed in their retreat by stopping to pick up my husband and take him with them. I will continue the parade alone with my hand chosen guardsmen, and I am fully confident that no harm will befall me." I ordered. The guardsman did not hesitate despite the immediate and loud protestations from the viscount.</p>
<p>I gave him one last tender kiss before showing him into the magnificent four horse carriage his friend the Baron resided in.</p>
<p>"Do not worry. I don't know how long I will be gone, but I will return to you unharmed." I reassured as he rode off. I then turned to the man I had put in charge of my guardsmen, Private Cosgrove. "Wayne, I need you to pull this buggy into somewhere private, and have the rest of the sailors reassure the crowd that the parade is still coming their way after a few changes."</p>
<p>Wayne and his guardsmen were the picture of efficiency as they found a warehouse with large doors to shanghai into a makeshift changing room for me. The guardsman were individually picked by yours truly because of two things they all had in common. Firstly they were all military men with access to uniforms, weaponry, and crowd control training. Secondly all 30 or so of them had, at some point, fucked me while I was working for Tallboy. This meant they knew the kind of person I was and would not stand in the way of my plans.</p>
<p>After a short period of time the crowds swelled as the door to the warehouse dramatically reopened. Slowly the buggy emerged and people cheered for a figure obscured by hey dust, standing and waving to the crowd. As the dust cleared and the figure came into focus, people were shocked to see a young man called Frederic who had very graciously let us into his boss's warehouse to make the necessary changes.</p>
<p>Pulling the buggy was a naked and disgraced pregnant woman, occasionally screaming into her bit every time he whipped her bottom to encourage her forward.</p>
<p>It thrilled me deep down to see the crowd go from joyous, to surprised, to shocked, then back to joyous so quickly. It was clear confirmation of the joke the poor were having at the expense of the rich, that one of theirs had lowered herself to being their abject servant. Not even a parade in her honour or the saintly impending motherhood would save her from the most disgraceful humiliations at the bidding of her peasant masters.</p>
<p>The eyes of the whole crowd were on me, my hands clamped onto the shaft to take most of the effort off the reins connected to my bit and the leather strap running under my engorged breasts and above less than inconspicuous baby bump. My hair was tied up in high ponytail and beaded to look like the tail of a carthorse, the string holding it in place the only thread on my body.</p>
<p>Wayne and his friends began parting the crowd to allow me to continue the parade as I had intended, an event to honour my position as a totally servile viscountess. I made sure to scream nice and loud so everyone could hear me every time he cracked the whip across my bottom, the red afterglow of pain not the only feeling of heat emanating from my body.</p>
<p>The jeers and catcalling cut right through me, every so often a member of the crowd would break through the guardsmen's corden and get a handful of my breasts or a firm swat on my bottom before being returned to the crowd.</p>
<p>After some time I began to get out of breath, my physician had advised me against strenuous exercise in my state, saying that if I got too out of breath, I was to stop and rest. Naturally I had planned for this and gave Wayne the signal to stop the parade so I could remove my straps and bit.</p>
<p>While still catching my breath, I climbed up onto the buggy with Frederic, and immediately let my lust get the better of me, wrapping my body around him and smothering him with my kisses. Frederic grabbed my braided ponytail and used it to steer my head lower, until I was staring at his crotch. As the crowd cheered me on, I took out his cock and greedily stuffed it down my mouth.</p>
<p>Scores of peasants were watching a heavily pregnant viscountess forswearing all virtue to sexually service a man she had met moments ago, I got high on feeling so low. He bluntly pulled my face off of his cock and turned me around to face the crowd, they laughed and mocked the ridiculous face I made as his penis slipped into my pussy and began pounding out any traces of reverence I was owed. It seemed that the novelty of the situation got to him as well as it wasn't long until I felt him filling me with his cum.</p>
<p>Still looking to catch my breath, I disengaged from my violator and moved on to meeting the crowd. I began shaking hands and making polite conversation about what a whore I was while semen dripped out of my pussy down my leg.</p>
<p>"You truly are a woman of the people. Do you just let anyone fuck you?" One woman asked.</p>
<p>"Usually it's only those who pay my pimp a pound and a crown, but today I'm giving my body away for free." I replied with honesty and grace while the man standing next to her kneaded my breasts.</p>
<p>"Your breasts are now leaking milk." A man observed. "May I have a drink?"</p>
<p>"Why of course." I replied. I pulled the man towards me and felt his mouth clamp around my nipple, drinking me in the street while Wayne and his friends struggled to hold back the crowd fighting to be next.</p>
<p>"Can I also drink your breast milk?" Another man asked.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I have to keep moving if I want the parade to be on schedule. Everyone in town needs to know what a whore I am." I replied, moving swiftly onwards.</p>
<p>"You bet you're a filthy whore. By tomorrow morning I bet the whole town's cum will be clinging to your slutty body." A man viscously jeered.</p>
<p>"You sir, what is your name?" I replied.</p>
<p>"It's Elijah." He replied without hesitation or fear.</p>
<p>"Very well Elijah. I have chosen you as the next person to take me for a ride." I announced, helping him out of the crowd and handing him the horse whip. He climbed onto the buggy and didn't even wait for me to finish attaching my various accoutrements before my bottom began feeling the sting of his wrath.</p>
<p>I had certainly picked a sadist to control the buggy on the next step of the journey, I constantly felt the bit being pulled into my mouth and the sting of the whip became a close friend. Unlike Frederic, who had simply taken the opportunity to smile and wave, Elijah yelled from the buggy with surprising volume and elocution.</p>
<p>"Gather round good people to witness the biggest whore in the kingdom!" He would yell. "Viscountess Melody of Montague did not let her noble birth, privileged life, or even growing the bastard child of a John in her womb, stop her from whoring herself out across cheapside. Come watch the cock-addled slut degrade herself for our amusement."</p>
<p>It wasn't long until we crested a hill and I saw my final destination, the docks. At the top of the hill I once again stopped the parade and signalled to Elijah that it was time for him to get his reward for acting as my master. He didn't wait for me to set the tempo, the moment I was on the buggy, he was pulling my hair back so the crowd could watch him suck the milk from my tits. Just as I thought that was the most embarrassing thing he could do, when he finished sucking, he pulled me forward and spat my own milk in my face, laughing at my screams of surprise.</p>
<p>Before I had even had time to recover, he bent me over and I felt his cock pressing against my ass. The source of his sadistic anger becoming clear as the below average girth parted my anus and began viciously thrusting into me. It felt like being fucked by a sewing machine that was also capable of pulling my hair.</p>
<p>I felt the familiar explosion of cum inside of me as Elijah flopped out. Before he would let me go meet the crowd he made me clean his dick with my mouth, and through the unique taste sensation, memories of dick cleaning duty flooded my mind as I once again approached the heaving crowd baying for my virtue's total destruction.</p>
<p>Stories of how Elijah had arrived on the buggy must have spread faster than the parade moved as this time scores of men gathered to be as rude as possible, hoping to be the next focus of my attention. At any slight miscalculation from Wayne's friends, a man would make it through close enough to slap my face or pull on my already tender nipples. Eventually one exclamation managed to scratch the right itch in terms of my hunt for another master.</p>
<p>"Urgh you dirty bitch. You just dropped cum out of your cunt onto my shoes." A woman yelled at me as I shuffled through the crowd.</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry." I replied. "How about I lick them clean before giving you a ride."</p>
<p>While the mostly male crowd were disappointed they weren't next in line to fuck me, the idea of a woman being my next mistress certainly seemed to be a placating silver lining for them.</p>
<p>I led her away from the crowd, and once I had enough space I kneeled down and began to lick the hideous stain from her already dirty shoes. The woman had a grin full of malice as she pulled me to my feet and shoved me back into my role as a buggy horse.</p>
<p>The final leg of the parade was downhill and I was grateful for it as it lessened my strain as I pulled my latest overseer. I looked to my left, and rushing through the crowd were two familiar faces, Ivy and Tiffany (I think). I had barely taken a couple more steps when I saw Bernadette and Tiffany (for sure this time) making their way towards the docks. At first I wondered what Tallboy had decided to put in place for me at the conclusion of this parade, but when I lifted my head a bit higher, I saw what was really driving then towards the docks.</p>
<p>That was definitely a galleon, maybe a couple of frigates and supply ships at its side, at the very least this was a small naval fleet on its way to dock. Tallboy had called an AHOD situation and here I was exposed and vulnerable, heading straight to the docks.</p>
<p>My mind tried to run wild with ideas of what could happen, but every time I became lost in thought my mistress would whip my bottom to encourage me to keep pulling her along my parade route.</p>
<p>We managed to arrive at the docks before the ships, I saw my coworkers taking their places by gangways and common areas to run a gangplank, their most risky outfits and poses ready to lure frustrated sailors to Tallboy's establishment, and meanwhile I parked my buggy right in the middle of them all and tucked myself under my mistress's dress to begin my obligation of bringing her to orgasm.</p>
<p>I had licked out a few women before, once or twice a John brought his wife or one of the girls took liberal advantage of me while on dick cleaning duty, but I still wasn't entirely used to it. Her dress shielded my face from shame but I could feel the breeze on the bottom half of my body, bent and protruding to show off my vulnerability to my audience. I began with some tentative licking, before deciding to commit and diving hard into her pussy, she moaned and squirmed a bit, but not as much as when I felt a cock pressing itself against my pussy.</p>
<p>I had no idea who had somehow broke the cordon and began violating me, but the crowd loved the sight of me reduced to spare parts to fuck while my head and face were buried into another woman's pleasure. I moaned with joy as I felt the cock surging inside of me, before retreating away to let the audience watch his seed drip from me. But my mistress was not yet done, she held my head tight to her pussy, bidding me to continue my degraded task, while another man took the opportunity to mount me.</p>
<p>By the time my mistress let me go, I had been fucked in the pussy thrice and twice in my ass. I surfaced to face a crowd positively boggled by my wanton harlotry. And as I looked out over the crowd, I also spotted the increasingly large contingent of naval seamen disembarking straight into my licentious show. The murmer of the audience quickly spreading the news that this pregnant slut, degrading herself and being openly fucked by strangers, was a viscountess with the most lapsed of morals.</p>
<p>What happened next happened so fast I couldn't believe it. Wayne's group of 30 friends were no match for entire regiments of horny seamen. The crowd was dispersed and at first I thought I was being rescued by a well-meaning but misguidedly chivalrous man. It wasn't until the first seamen took me by the arm, then used his spare hand to grab my bottom, that I realised I wasn't being rescued, I was being impressed.</p>
<p>The men surrounded me and endless hands seemed to work together to guide my path while leaving every inch of my body explored. I was heading towards the very gangplank they had just used to disembark from the galleon. At one point I tried to resist, I told them who I was and the trouble they would be in for kidnapping me, they responded with the most irreverent of jeers and much firmer handling.</p>
<p>They took me below decks, I was not as accustomed to changing light levels as they were, so while I descended into the darkness, I found myself being steered by those less deprived of their sight. Gradually my eyes adjusted, and just in time to see the chain and collar affixed to the wall that they were determined to attach to me. I once again screamed and squirmed, but this only made the rotters laugh more as they pinned my arms and legs to the floor while the metal collar was clipped around my neck. The collar was large and heavy so it could house a key and locking mechanism, so the moment the metallic clunk of its activation was confirmed, the men let me go knowing I was now their prisoner.</p>
<p>"This here's what we got instead of a brig." One of the men announced, I could tell by his uniform he was Sub-Lieutenant, and the men around him respected his rank, even though it was low by the standards of the circles I ran in. "Chains for mutineers. Now the way we see it, we're loyal to our Lord High Admiral, and there's no bigger mutineer than the dirty whore who thought she knew better than him about how to run a navy."</p>
<p>"Please sir, I..." I began.</p>
<p>"Shut up slut." Another man yelled, silencing me with a slap to the face.</p>
<p>"Now we're not due to dock here long. By my estimate we'll be casting off in an hour or so. So say a final farewell to civilization because you've just been acquired as this ship's private whore." The Sub-Lieutenant announced. I didn't have time to object before I felt a cock ramming itself into my mouth.</p>
<p>The men who had impressed me began to have their way with me. I was pulled and grabbed, had my mouth, pussy and anus filled with cocks while more men spanked my bottom or drank milk straight from my tits. My unborn child was called a bastard and a son of a bitch, mocked with the weight of its mother's sins even before its birth. And then, inevitably, I heard the sound that heralded my doom.</p>
<p>"Order to cast off!" Echoed around the ship, my mouth had not been emptied to scream since I arrived, but the men violating me at that time chuckled at my flailing dispair as I felt the ship shudder to one side as pushed away from the dock and the wind caught the sails to propel it away from the land.</p>
<p>We had been sailing for barely a moment, when the Sub-Lieutenant returned below decks.</p>
<p>"Come on, get her off the wall, we have a crew to introduce her to." He yelled.</p>
<p>The men detached the chain from the wall, so it and the collar could still be used as a makeshift leash, before getting me up and leading me up above decks. I was stopped at the final set of stairs below the opening to the main deck, held by a private while the Sub-Lieutenant went ahead to report. I couldn't see who he was talking to but I could hear there was a strange chain of command where his report was passed from one person to another as it made its way up a chain of command, until the most posh voice of the lot gave a less formal set of feedback.</p>
<p>"In the past we discussed how the rumours you were spreading about Viscountess Melody of Montague were gaining traction and coming back with all sorts of exaggerations. After what my men witnessed at the docks we are starting to suspect they may be true. As we arrived, the viscountess was naked and performing sex acts on women and ment right there at the docks." He reported.</p>
<p>"That's absurd, surely there are now first hand accounts of this." A familiar voice retorted.</p>
<p>"There are an overwhelming number of first hand accounts, and just in case you don't believe all of them, we made sure to rescue the viscountess for her own safety, would you like to speak to her?" The man holding my leash did not wait for his response as he pulled me up onto the deck and threw me at the feet of the Lord High Admiral.</p>
<p>"This is exactly as we found her in the streets." The Sub-Lieutenant reassured, reacting to the look of shock on the Lord High Admiral's face.</p>
<p>"Even if what you say is true, I would have a very difficult time proving it." He surmised. "Ever since she got this heroine of cheapside schtick I've had to tread carefully on ruining her reputation. If I report to the court what happened, they would think that it was a beyond the pale slander against the viscountess' modest and humble character."</p>
<p>He was right, but he shouldn't have admitted as such in front of me. I had an idea, but as well as that I had a plan to have a little fun beforehand.</p>
<p>"You are of course right." I announced. "Nobody would believe you. Even if you report the truth to them. Even if you tell them that since you tricked me into investigating whores, I became one with my heart and body, that for the last few months I have been violated by hundreds of different men and loved each and every one. You could report back that the parentage of my baby is indeed in question due to the disgraceful whoring of its mother. You could even report back the most outlandish truth that the parade in my honour was organised by me just as an opportunity to indulge the deepest depths of my twisted deviant desires. Each and every truth so outlandish, and your objections to me so well known, that nobody would ever believe you."</p>
<p>The Lord High Admiral turned red with frustrated rage. He could see all the machinations, any proof he offered would only be proof of his devilish schemes against me, my reputation and the circumstances around it insulating me from any consequences he could deliver. All he could do was hope that I would one day get exposed and he would be vindicated, but he could not lift a hand to ensure that exposure. I felt godly, enshrining my power over the Lord High Admiral while stood naked, chained, and dripping with cum in his presence.</p>

<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>"So with that in mind, let's plan what comes next, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. How many days are we from the next scheduled docking for this ship?" I asked.</p>
<p>"We have plans to restock up north at Inverschloss before heading back. Should be about a 3 day round trip if the wind stays the way it is." The admiral reasoned.</p>
<p>"Very well, now your Sub-Lieutenant tells me that I have been impressed as a ship's private whore, isn't that right sir?" I recalled, drinking in the awkward squirming thamis elicited from my captor. "So let's lay out my duties. I will provide sexual entertainment for any and all men aboard this ship for the duration of the journey. As I have been commissioned, albeit forcefully, I will be paid handsomely for this service. As it is in your best interests I will assume you will impress upon your sailors the importance that no permanent harm be done to me during my employ."</p>
<p>"You get three days of abject humiliation of your political enemy, I get to indulge my sickest desires, and after three days I disembark with a lot of money and a mutual agreement that this little vacation from courtly squabbles will not affect either our station or reknown. I feel this is mutually beneficial." I surmised. The Lord High Admiral was lost in thought for a moment, I saw his face contort with rage as he shook his head.</p>
<p>"Very well, as Lord High Admiral, I grant you the honorary rank of Bitch Sub-Private. And I'm going to get my go with you before you get ruined by all the cocks you'll be servicing." He announced. I chuckled thinking of how, in this context, 'bitch' is an adjective.</p>
<p>"I assure you, sir. I was ruined a long..." my witty retort was cut short by him grabbing my chain and dragging me back to the captain's cabin that had been made available to him.</p>
<p>He slammed the door behind me, grabbed my breasts and squeezed with manic intensity.</p>
<p>"I fucking hate you." He sneered as he turned me around and bent me over a table, not caring for the damage my leaking breasts were doing to his navigational charts. "I'm going to fuck you, then I'm going to love watching you be my ship's bitch for the journey. You are going to regret crossing me."</p>
<p>As his cock pushed its way into my vagina, I already regretted crossing him, his cock was so small there was no pleasure to be gained even from a hate fuck.</p>
<p>"All this time, you thought you were better than men who worked their whole lives in service of the king, but at the end of the day, your just another filthy piece of gutter trash fucking your way through peasantry." He practically screamed as my vagina felt under attack from a particularly resilient eyeliner brush. "Answer me, are you a woman of nobility or a dirty whore?"</p>
<p>"Yes." I replied with a cheeky grin. This only made him madder.</p>
<p>"Apologise for being a dirty whore." He yelled, his cock showing the telltale signs of being about to burst.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry that I, a dirty whore, got the better of you." I replied, waiting for him to cum before delivering the twist that was most damaging to his ego.</p>
<p>"Shut the fuck up whore." He snarled, pulling me to my knees. "Suck my cock clean, then fuck off and be a bitch to all my men, see how far that gets you."</p>
<p>I took to my duty exactly as he ordered, it was like smoking a sex flavoured cigarette. As I felt it become more and more turgid in my mouth, he eventually pulled up his trousers in anger and kicked me out to the deck to be left at the hands of his crew.</p>
<p>The three days that followed were a blissful whirlwind of complete disempowerment. Within the rigid system of ranks on a ship, I was the lowest of the low and had to conduct myself accordingly. Every person would be addressed as sir and saluted accordingly, even while they acted in such disrespectful ways to myself. In the days to come the Lord High Admiral would clarify that my honorary rank was not just below private, it was below any living thing related to naval operations, so when we stopped at Inverschloss and visited the farmers restocking our ship, I had to salute the cows and pigs.</p>
<p>In-between the play with my new found rank was my sexual services, this usually fell into two categories. Either I would be below deck, acting as a cock sponge for any man not currently seeing to their duties, or the men would choose to vent their sadism at me in hazings similar to the newly commissioned but far worse. Sometimes I would be a dinner show, dancing and exposing myself for laughs of the crew as they threw their leftovers at me. The laughs would then continue as I shovelled those leftovers off the floor and into my mouth.</p>
<p>One man proposed giving me a naval tattoo, as most men had, but one more befitting my rank. They were getting ready to permanently write whore above my pussy when a man of higher rank intervened. I was as disappointed as anyone else but in retrospect it's a good thing he did, I'm not sure how I would have explained that to my husband.</p>
<p>When the crew were told to the sun has risen enough to make ready for port, sensing that my three day humiliation was coming to an end, they unleashed their harshest punishments on me. They no longer wanted to fuck me, they had all had their turns in the previous days, they wanted instead to release me back on the streets in a form so degraded as to be disgusting beyond fuckability.</p>
<p>I already stank from the sweaty dirty sex I had endured, but they made sure the smell was taken to the next level by forcing me to kneel then showering me with their piss. As I walked the ship, men spat and complained at me. One of the officers graced the captain's cabin and returned with a series of quills to begin writing all manner of insults on my already desecrated body.</p>
<p>By the time we pulled into port, I was an absolute state. Covered in filth, labelled as a disgusting wretch in every piece of florid prose seaman could conjure. My pregnant belly now covered in insults directed at my unborn child, my face covered in drawings of cocks and digs at my virtue. As the ship pulled in, I found myself in the captain's quarters facing the Lord High Admiral.</p>
<p>"My fee is 500 pounds." I informed him. I had calculated this as enough to settle my ongoing debts to Tallboy. "I do not need it now, I have no pockets to keep it in. But please make it available to me in the coming days, or I will be writing up a detailed report of my treatment on this ship."</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah. I'll do it don't you worry you filthy degenerate." He sneered.</p>
<p>"Spiffing. Well, before I disembark, are there any other insults you'd like to throw at me?" I asked, in an incredibly chipper mood.</p>
<p>"Only that you now are as disgusting on the outside as you are on the inside. I hope the whole kingdom sees you like this."</p>
<p>"Ooh, could you imagine." I swooned as I walked off his ship and into cheapside, garnering no small amount of attention from the handful of early risers, hoping Tallboy had a dress to spare, and probably a room to stay in while I washed off all this writing staining my skin.</p>
<p>My arrival at Tallboy's premises was treated in a similar fashion to the arrival of a child with a still lit match at the scene of a recent explosion where a gunpowder factory used to be. At first the women ministered to me, their primary concern was for my wellbeing. Bless them, with all the troubles I have brought down upon their world, they still didn't bother me a peep until they had me dressed, cleaned, and relaxed with a warm bun. Then they explained the situation.</p>
<p>Despite my protestations to the contrary, my husband had indeed worried when I didn't return from the parade. So he descended on cheapside with an army of constables looking for me. Naturally his first stop was the premises I had been spending an overwhelming amount of my time at. They had taken in Tallboy for questioning, but he had not since been returned.</p>
<p>Tensions were incredibly high, the residents of the poor area of town started a rumour that my kidnapping was orchestrated by the aristocracy to end my advocacy for their rights, an understandable conspiracy considering I was last seen forcibly being loaded onto a ship the Lord High Admiral boarded a few moments later. While the Aristocracy believed that I had naively ignored the inherent degeneracy of the impoverished and my trust had been rewarded with some horrible fate at the hands of malicious peasants. There had been fights in the streets, a bubbling riot brewing from equally escalating retaliations and anger.</p>
<p>Firstly I got as conservative a dress as they could offer, the tailor doing some quick alterations to a dress for one of the larger working girls to have it fit over my pregnant frame, my breasts were practically spilling out of the cleavage and the skirting barely covered my thighs, but it would have to do considering the alternative was nothing at all. I then had to apply a thick layer of makeup to basically all of my exposed skin to obscure the cock drawings and slurs to my character that soap and water had only succeeded in fading slightly. I was far less of a disgrace than I had been, but it was a far fall from the state my husband and the aristocracy had left me in.</p>
<p>My first stop was to return home, I needed a maternity dress that was more conservative than what I was wearing and to tell my husband to call off the police.</p>
<p>"Lord alive Melody, where have you been? And what are you wearing?" The viscount yelled the moment I stepped into the house.</p>
<p>"Oh honey, I told you not to fear for me. At the end of the parade I was learning so much and talking to many sections of the community. I even met some nice sailors who had heard of my work opposing impressment, who wanted me to see conditions aboard their shop. At first I was hesitant, but the Lord High Admiral himself offered to join me on the journey to ensure nothing bad happened to me. During those days I learned so much, however my dress did get somewhat ruined so I had to return to Tallboy's to pick up something that didn't smell to high heavens." I explained with the smoothness of a lie thought up and practised over a long walk home.</p>
<p>"But honey, that dress makes you look like a whore, I hope you weren't seen by anyone influential." He replied, his concerns for my wellbeing tossed aside when there was status to worry about.</p>
<p>"It is still early, you're the only person of influence awake. So if you inform the police to step down their hunt, I'll change and go tell the people of Cheapside that I do not need their protection, and together we can head off this crisis." I ordered, and my husband obeyed, immediately leaving to go take care of business. Once alone in the house, I went and found the one possession I had missed since I had disembarked from the Lord High Admiral's ship: a full length mirror in which to fully take in the disgraced state I walked the streets in without consequence.</p>
<p>I knew I had to go get Tallboy out of prison, but I felt like he could wait a few more moments while I have myself one more orgasm at the memories of my adventure.</p>
<p>It was staggering how quickly I went from my absurdly deviant and sexual adventures, to a quiet and chaste mother. When I bailed Tallboy out of prison, I fully paid off my debts, informing him that I probably would be around again when the mood took me in the future, but I had outgrown my dependency on him. He informed me that my value was dropping fast with what pregnancy and childcare would do to my body anyway.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards I gave birth to a little boy we named Thomas, and the doctor remarked upon what a large and sturdy child he was. I felt no shame of loss to give up on my studies and fetishes for this little child I grew to care for, at least for the first year. The itch for adventure did steadily grow. Slowly childcare was taken over by maids, tutors and nannies, and although I dearly love Thomas and enjoy spending time with him, I also enjoy when I have spare moments to myself and I begin living vicariously through my past, indulging small erotic endeavours that mirrored those wild days.</p>
<p>Soon I began sneaking off, sometimes to go to the library and study, sometimes to visit my academic friends, sometimes to once again walk the streets of cheapside meeting the working people.of the kingdom who still thought both highly and lowly of me. These trips would always have one thing in common, I would always desecrate their locations with my wanton lust in one way or another.</p>
<p>When Thomas became 3 years old and my husband told me that given his impressive advancement under his tutors, that he could start boarding school fairly soon, my sadness at his increasing absence was soon clouded out by the return of my erotic demons, now once again given an undistracted purpose, to make up for the bubbling cauldron of deviancy that had been building pressure since I had such a wild adventure.</p>
<p>Soon I found myself handing Dr. Sutcliffe a research proposal that all courtly politics would make impossible to turn down.</p>
<p>I propose that I travel with one of the galleons in His Imperial Majesty's Fleet. Investigating conditions and economies in each town it makes port in.</p>
<p>During my last voyage the Lord High Admiral gave me an honourary rank that I would be keen to take up again, and I have already discussed a program of ongoing remuneration where I will compensate the Navy for the inconvenience as the journey progresses.</p>
<p>I wish to see it all and learn what life is like for everyone in our kingdom, from the sailors and dock staff, to the beggars and whores, I would even like to spend some time learning about the conditions in which we keep livestock. All to gain a deeper understanding of the lives of the less well off in our kingdom.</p>
<p>This research could take a very long time, but I am committed to seeing it through, no matter how difficult things get for me. I am excited to see what I'm capable of.</p>
