<p>It was a warm Spanish spring and Maya's tears evaporated almost immediately as they splashed on the hot asphalt that made up the empty streets of Madrid. She didn't know where she was running or what she was going to do, she just knew she couldn't be around Felipe a moment longer.</p>
<p>It had started, as falling outs often do, with a discussion about money. Coronavirus was hitting Spain hard, Felipe had chosen to revive an old grievance, that Maya's artistic dreams were trumping the need to constantly acquire capital. Maya never felt she had unrealistic dreams, she never wanted to be a millionaire or go to lavish parties where the deep and thoughtful spent the night indulging money launderers and tax dodgers.</p>
<p>Maya wanted a life where she could squeeze together a living seeing the beauty in the world.</p>
<p>For an art graduate what that meant was a day job as an admin at an art supply wholesaler, plenty of evening gigs teaching art, and occasionally she would be able to get away long enough to put together a painting or two of her own. These paintings tended to sit in a gallery unsold long enough to compel her to awkwardly drop the price and accept a measly handful of Euros for something she had spent hours on.</p>
<p>Felipe didn't get her focus, he had clearly seen her art as something she would grow out of, instead she grew out of him and left. But she left to a world that was closed, she couldn't go to a hotel or a friend's house, she had her handbag and the clothes on her back but what she needed was a plan. Eventually she held back the pain long enough to think clearly and a plan formed in her mind, her workplace would be empty, she had pretty much spent the night there once or twice before, she could hide out there long enough to find a place to live.</p>
<p>The key fob and alarm code still worked from when everyone was told to work from home. She walked through the ornate entranceway and pressed the lift for the third floor where her company was based. As she opened the door a waft of warm air washed over her body. Clearly the managers didn't see the point in leaving on the air conditioning when nobody was meant to be in the office. Maya opened the windows, she didn't want the office power bill snitching on her squatting. Once all the windows were open, she sat on the floor and allowed herself a moment to swim in the sadness and grief that overwhelmed her.</p>
<p>Maya cried for some time between five minutes and two hours, before getting to work making the office into the kind of place she could spend the night. One of her co-workers had a blanket for the cold winter months and her bosses office had a sofa for visitors. She snuggled herself in and prepared for a long and ugly night.</p>
<p>By the morning Maya was on the floor, the blanket discarded and her clothes drenched with sweat and tears. She took a moment to wonder what she had to do today and was surprised that the answer was nothing and everything. It was a Sunday, all her art classes were cancelled, her professional and personal lives on a total pause. So she focussed on getting dug in to spending the long haul at her workplace. The first concern was food, the staff fridge had been cleared out so it could be turned off, but the cupboards were filled with instant rice, cakes, biscuits and drinks. It wouldn't last long but she didn't immediately have to worry about shopping.</p>
<p>Next was making the office homely. Maya wandered the office amazed at how a change in perspective could make it come alive. Before the office was the site of a concession to the corporate world, her five day a week prison of capitalism was now her sanctuary away from an aggressive force of consumerist complicity that was supposed to be her home and family. It helped that as an art supplies store they had made it look the part, swirls of colours dancing around the open plan desks, running around the office before streaming towards a colourful mural in the style of Pablo Picasso. Maya wanted to do what she always did when she came across unexpected beauty, she wanted to paint it.</p>
<p>Maya 'borrowed' some art supplies from the demo storehouse they had in the office, a time honoured tradition among the artistic workers that peppered the staff rosters, and got to work on her painting. She fastidiously painted every office detail before splashing colour over the walls and doing everything in her power to breathe life and redemption into a building that had formerly filled her with such dread.</p>
<p>She took a step back from her painting and it just looked like her office. To her it may have been breathed life anew but to anybody else it would never get a second glance, there was no burst of freedom on the canvas just another factory of consumerism.</p>
<p>It was getting hot again and Maya regretted the black polyester trousers and long sleeve top she had been wearing when she left, but this gave her an idea. Nudity! artists have been using nudity to signify freedom forever. Maya noticed how the colours swirled around her painting and identified the perfect place for a naked person to sit. Of course Maya knew she wouldn't be able to get a life model in and she didn't want to be flying blind so she knew what she would have to do.</p>
<p>Looking around the office, Maya slowly undid the fly on her trousers, awkwardly shuffling on her seat to allow the fabric to escape and fall to the floor, pulling off her socks as she wiggled her feet out of the crumple of fabric. She lifted her top over her head and sat for a second in her comfortable underwear, feeling a deep sense of joy that she could re-conceptualise her office with her body. She unclipped her bra and felt the fabric loosen as her breasts pleaded to be free. She let out a shuddering breath as she pulled the bra away from her and placed it on her pile of clothes. Finally a little moan escaped her mouth as her knickers followed their path down her legs and were removed from her body.</p>
<p>Maya took a moment to relish the freedom she sought to celebrate. She stood up and wandered the office, her new kingdom of solitude. A tentative walk became a skip, a skip became a dance, soon Maya found herself laughing and singing as she celebrated the world she was crafting for herself. She propped her phone camera next to her easel and set a timer before bounding to the desk she had chosen and draping her naked body over her co-worker's keyboard, giggling at the clumsy imposition of office equipment.</p>
<p>Maya returned to her easel and sat down, seeing no need to put her clothes back on to complete her painting. She used the photo as a reference and began to paint her naked form onto the canvas. Maya had never appeared in one of her own paintings before, so she had never studied her body closely as she was now doing. She had never let it bother her that she was shorter than average, in fact her proportions matched the desk quite well, her tanned skin light enough to differentiate herself from the brown desk but dark enough to sweep her body away with the swirls of colour that formed a cyclone of imagination in the otherwise conservative office.</p>
<p>Her pussy was unshaven, a statement on how much she valued her relationship with Felipe, she made sure her bush proudly stood out away from the smooth curves made from her ample thighs draping over the desk. Her bottom, although more toned than she would have thought, still had enough give in it to make it a tricky contour as it unevenly squashed itself over the desk and keyboard. She almost let vanity take her hand to flatten her tummy, but if she was going to embrace freedom she knew she had to do so honestly and didn't shy away from painting the bulge of stomach that stuck out as she bent over backwards. Next she got to her breasts, she had always loved her breasts; C-cups not too big but not a surfboard, perfect for such a composition where gravity was clearly pulling them towards her head, but full and pert enough to impose themselves away from the body, areola that didn't dominate and nipples stiff enough to really stick out and draw the eye, no better way to convey her genuine excitement.</p>
<p>Once she had finished her outstretched arms she moved on to painting her face, the look of purest joy and exhilaration, it was vital that the canvas reflected it, every tooth in her beaming smile, the twinkle of fluorescent lights reflecting deepest satisfaction in her electric blue eyes. Finally her long draping bright purple hair, streaking with colour, as if joy was merging her with the office itself. It was mid afternoon by the time the painting was finished and Maya thought it was her best work yet, it was a shame she had no plans to sell it or even let another human being see it, although that didn't stop her hanging the picture in pride of place on the wall in her bedroom, the former boss' office.</p>
<p>Maya spent the rest of the evening relishing the ability to lounge around the office naked, she watched a movie on one of the computers, cooked herself some instant rice in a microwave and even placed a shopping order to get some toiletries, nice food, and wine in. As the sun went down she felt she had just had the perfect lazy Sunday.</p>
<p>The automatic alarm on her phone woke Maya up early Monday morning, she was meant to go to work today. A feeling of dread creeped over her, not just the usual Monday morning despondency, but the deep fear that her new outlook on her office would be lost to the renewed mundanity of her mandatory routine. The cupboards had cereal but no milk so Maya ended up pouring the contents of her bowl back into the cereal packet and settling for Nutella spread on some cheap Madeira cake she was sure nobody would miss.</p>
<p>Usually at this point Maya would have a shower, but there wasn't a shower in her office, she would have to go to work with two days worth of sweat on her, today was not going to be a good day. Maya let a scream of frustration echo her empty office and then tried to think of a way forward. She remembered that when they first refurbished the office they were offered a shower and turned it down, so it stood to reason one of the other offices in the building could have one. She couldn't get into any of the offices that were currently let out, but the former sportswear brand offices on the ground floor had still not found a new company to fill them and if anyone needed a shower it would be an office full of sporty people.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances the prudent thing would be to put on her clothes and nip downstairs to check, but Maya knew she was fighting against prudence and needed some drastic action to prevent her office building becoming oppressive once again. To that end she decided to leave her clothes behind and roam the building naked.</p>
<p>Maya took one step out of the door and suddenly remembered that she needed her key fob, she stuck her foot back behind her, catching the door before it closed. Her stomach churned at the thought that had she taken another step she would have been locked out of her office, trapped in her freedom. She skipped over to her key fob and picked it up before once again heading out of the door.</p>
<p>The corridors were more intimidating than Maya thought they would be, painted plaster meeting burgundy carpet, the ever-present thought that even though her office was empty, it didn't mean the others were too, not to mention part of the journey took her across the entranceway which could be seen from the road, suddenly her jaunt of freedom filled her with trepidation. Every creak and draft a powerhouse of paranoia that someone would be around the corner to put an end to her freedom.</p>
<p>She got to where the stairway met the reception, a big open featureless gray marble box with a single desk that would hold a receptionist in less virulent times. Maya gazed out and absent any prying eyes streaked across the hallway, down to the door to the ground floor office. She pressed on the door and felt deepest joy as it yielded to her touch and allowed her access.</p>
<p>The ground floor office was almost completely featureless, grey concrete walls ceilings and floors, with a row of windows contained behind a row of cheap beige blinds. The giant cubicle had a few doors coming off it, the managers' offices, the toilets and to Maya's stunned amazement, a shower room, white tiles welcoming her to the new expansion in her empire of nudity.</p>
<p>Maya's toiletries would be arriving with the delivery from the shop in the afternoon so for now she was just in the market for a rinse, she turned on the shower and it sputtered to life, spitting out rusty pipe water that slowly gave way to a clear and fresh waterfall. It looked set to be another blazing hot day so Maya set the temperature low and let out a squeak as she stepped into the refreshing stream (she would later find out it didn't matter where she set the water temperature, the hot water had been switched off long ago). The shower was magnificent, every cell of her body felt refreshed and stimulated as the cold water crashed it's way over her naked skin. Maya stayed in the shower as long as she could, but eventually concerns about the outside world intervened and she found herself stepping out.</p>
<p>Wet footprints slapped their way across the concrete floor, Maya didn't have a towel and so had opted to air dry as she went about her naked day. Peeking out at the empty reception and satisfied with the absence of humanity, she skipped to the stairs and up to return to the office she had made her own. She was under no illusion she was not going to wear clothes for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Maya sat down at her desk, free and ready to face the day. She powered on her computer and ran her hands up and down her body before getting down to business looking at the latest invoices. Her joy overflowed at her rebellion, sitting naked at her desk, nobody the wiser that she was a nymph, a changeling imitating a responsible worker.</p>
<p>Maya had only been working half an hour when she got a notification, her boss was asking her to join a video conference. Suddenly her carefree nudity morphed into a frantic search for her clothes. She shoved her breasts into her bra, pulled on her top, even put on her trousers and knickers despite her lower half being below the desk, before accepting the invitation to the meeting.</p>
<p>"Maya! Glad you could join us, sorry for the short notice but the director of finance was planning a new invoicing system and I wanted to bring in someone who uses our current system." One of the many pale managers beamed over a camera. It was the least nymph-like Maya had ever felt.</p>
<p>After giving her input to the managers meeting Maya couldn't even bring herself to strip again. She spent the day sat in front of the computer in a dark mood. Her mood lightened at the arrival of her shopping, then darkened after the delivery man could only leave all her shopping in the entrance way and she had to carry it up to the office herself. That night she had a cheap microwave meal, a bottle of wine, and a post-mortem on her good mood.</p>
<p>"I didn't need to put these fucking clothes on." She drunkenly slurred to herself. "I could have said my camera wasn't working, or pointed the camera at my head so they couldn't see below my neck. In fact, why am I still wearing these sons of bitches?" Maya clumsily pulled off her trousers and wrenched her top over her head, the strained elastic made a slight ripping sound that made her slow down. "Careful Maya, those are your only clothes." In the fog of her drunk impulsive mind Maya had an idea she couldn't shake. She took off her remaining clothes and went across the office to the corner with the photo-copier.</p>
<p>She was not looking for the photo-copier but the small device kept next to it, another tool of liberation the office had offered to her. She took her top and lowered it into the slot, the electronic whirring confirming that the shredder had sprung to life and was dutifully eating her top. She took some nearby scissors and used them to ensure her polyester trousers were cut into more manageable chunks, feeding them one by one into the shredder. Next she cut off the metal clasps on her bra and unthreaded the under-wire to ensure what remained would be a suitable snack for her new favourite office pet. Finally she took off her knickers and joyed in their devouring. As an unnecessary but liberating act Maya took the bin under the shredder and tipped its contents out of the window, her soul soaring as she watched the colourful fabric flutter to the ground.</p>
<p>"No safety net now, fear can't control me anymore." She mumbled as she staggered towards her bed. She looked up at the painting of her naked form lounging in the office, she wondered what it would be like if she too made a Dorian Grey style bargain. What if any time she put clothes on they would melt away, the picture taking their burden as she remained unencumbered for the rest of her life? That night she had good dreams.</p>
<p>Maya awoke to a groaning realisation of what she had done last night. She stared at the under-wire of her bra and the pile of metal clasps to confirm it wasn't some drunk imaginings. She took her usual trip to the downstairs office to take her shower and wash off the drunken remnants of her night before, trying to refresh herself for the day ahead. As she walked back across the empty office she jumped at a shadow of a pedestrian walking outside, reaffirming to her just how vulnerable she had made herself.</p>
<p>She sat down in front of her computer and looked at today's calendar. Not much work to do, but to her horror there was a video meeting late in the afternoon for the whole department. Her mind swirled with ideas to get through the meeting without clothes, the obvious answer being to keep the camera turned off, but to Maya that was just one step removed from wearing clothes, she was meant to be a nymph, and nymphs were as cunning as they were mischievous.</p>
<p>She went back to the art supply cupboard and picked out some choice paints, meticulously thinking through which of her outfits would work with the look she was going for. Eventually envisioning her outfit, she took a chair into the women's toilet, and sat in front of the mirror. Dipping her paintbrush into the paint, she moaned with mischievous joy as the brush began to glide over her torso. She created a white base coat, but with meticulously planned creases and folds following the natural contours of her body. As a final idea, she painted a fine grey layer around her breasts to make it look like her blouse was slightly translucent and her bra was visible underneath where her sweat from the hot day had caused the white fabric to cling to her body. This covered for the fine olive of her skin that showed through the white paint and drew attention to her breasts, the darker colour hiding the contours caused by nipples currently standing to attention.</p>
<p>Maya looked at the time and saw it had only just reached lunch time. But she was having so much fun she figured why not continue bodypainting. She went over to her shopping and praised her forward thinking in buying a razer and some shaving cream, her pussy was going to need some work before she could paint trousers onto herself. She also grabbed that obnoxious bowl that Conchita bought to try and guilt the office into eating more fruit, she took specific pride thinking about how her pubes were about to be floating around in it.</p>
<p>It was awkward squatting in the toilet over a bowl of water, so much so Maya couldn't even get excited at the feeling of metal blades gliding over her pubis, leaving behind smooth skin. Nonetheless when she was done and saw her glistening pubis, clean and clear, it only spurred her on with the next part of her plan.</p>
<p>Black paint and lots of it, liberally splashed down each leg, before lumping great dollops of the stuff with smooth brush strokes down her waist and tickled across her pussy, giggling as much at the joy of the deception she was putting together as the tickling sensation of brushstrokes over tender skin, stopping only to paint a subtle button and fly just below her 'blouse'.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Maya admired herself in the mirror, she admired her body, her ingenuity and her artistic talent all at the same time. She looked like she was wearing the tightest black trousers she owned and the fake bra effect accentuated how naughty even her pretend outfit was. But for Maya her favourite bit was standing up, turning around and seeing the sudden shift from clothes on her front to bare unpainted skin on her back, laughing at the sudden and absurd transformation. She sat down at her desk and willed the clock to move faster to put her skills to the ultimate test.</p>
<p>The notification splashed across Maya's computer, the meeting had started and three people were currently there. She wanted to wait for five people to have signed in before going in herself to make sure her feed was small and could be easily overlooked. She had opened the screen to sign in and a preview of her camera feed sat on her screen, the cheeky Maya from another universe staring back at her with eyes that screamed of embarrassment and fear.</p>
<p>"They're all going to see your tits." She seemed to say, "everyone's eyes are going to be drawn to them and with your nipples sticking out like bullets that paint is not going to fool them for a second, they're going to know your naked and they're going to laugh and fire you and then call your..." her thoughts were interrupted by the meeting count hitting five and Maya deciding the best way to silence her mind was to click 'join meeting.'</p>
<p>"Hey Maya, how are things where you are?" Her boss asked.</p>
<p>"Hot." Maya bluntly replied hoping the attention would quickly move off her.</p>
<p>"Tell me about it." Her manager responded. "Hang on, Maya..." Maya's heart started beating out of her chest, her boss was staring quizzically at his screen, which she knew meant he was staring at her, during the pause the rest of the co-workers joined in on trying to figure out what he had just noticed about Maya. "Are you at the office?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes." She quickly replied. "My boyfriend lives very close-by and I find I get more work done here."</p>
<p>"Well as long as you are staying safe when you travel." Her boss replied before getting into the main meeting, Maya fading into the background as more and more people gave disproportionately impassioned views about paint ingredients.</p>
<p>"We've also been asked to check none of our paint strippers contain dichloromethane as it's legal in the manufacturer country but not here. Actually we might be in luck there. Maya, as you are in the office you can just nip to the demo supply cupboard and check." Maya felt a lump form in her stomach, she couldn't walk away from the web-cam normally without giving her co-workers a view of her unpainted back, but the demo supply cupboard through the door right behind her. She smiled obligingly as she rose from her chair desperately keeping her face towards the camera and her body bent double as she feigned confirming details as she backed away.</p>
<p>Maya felt her bare bottom bump into the door, she blindly reached for the handle, asking if there was anything else they wanted, spewing whatever she could think of to make it not suspicious that she wasn't turning her back on the camera. Her hand fumbled on the metal handle, pulling it down as Maya felt the door swing away from her, she backed through the door and closed it, sighing with relief.</p>
<p>Free of the webcam's watchful gaze, Maya was carefree as she went to the cupboard and got out the two varieties of paint stripper her manager had asked her to find. For an impulsive second she imagined pouring the grey jug of liquid down herself, wondering how her co-workers would respond to her reappearing naked, she managed to think better of it but it didn't put her out of the mood to do something strange. She decided that she would hold the two bottles at her side as she walked back to the meeting, she would stand up straight and she would give her co-workers a clear view of her painted body.</p>
<p>Maya stood by the door, her heart beating harder than it ever had before, her legs shaking at the thought of moving her towards this silly idea she had concocted. Before her doubts could silence her resolve she pushed open the door.</p>
<p>"Found them!" Maya yelled, ensuring that the sound of her voice would catch the attention of the algorithms within the video meeting call, automatically turning all virtual eyes towards the camera pointed directly at her. She slowly walked towards her computer, the bottles in her hands gripped so tight she worried that they would explode, showering her with paint stripper, dissolving the illusion that kept her co-workers from noticing that not a stitch of fabric stood between Maya's camera and Maya's body. Her secret exposure drew her breath deep into her body and held it close, her whole team was witnessing her vulnerable essence merging with technology and disseminated by an unblinking robot eye.</p>
<p>Maya sat down and caught her breath, immediately segwaying for the ethereal thrill of cyber exhibitionism to the mundanity of reading the ingredients of paint stripper. Her mind and body both screamed at the change of mood but Maya silenced them with promises of indulgence once capitalism had finished taking its tax of her imagination.</p>
<p>The meeting went on far too long, so long that it only ended as the working hours of the day were done. The moment her computer was closed Maya stood up and danced around the office, her energy and jubilation far outstripping any ideas she had of what to do now. She didn't want to sully an emotional expression of artistic freedom with the crass indulgence of masturbation, but her pussy screamed for attention. In the end Maya felt she had no choice, the ecstasy of the flesh beckoned her and before she knew it she was in her bosses office. She sat on the comfortable chair under the supervision of the painting of her first ecstatic nudity and her hand peeled apart her paint soaked labia to play with the glistening pink within.</p>
<p>Orgasm after orgasm washed over Maya, her joy uncontained as without anyone in the office she felt no need to silence her blissful screams, as she had done at Felipe's when her late night horniness got the better of her and she didn't feel like waking the snoring presence sharing her bed. Time lost all meaning as she twitched and shuddered herself into her bed, awaking only a few hours later when the hunger of a missed dinner sent her groggily to the kitchen. As she came back with her microwave meal, she saw the sheer amount of paint that had rubbed onto the blanket and cursed herself for giving into her carnal desires so recklessly. So contrite was Maya she would only masturbate three more times that night, once after she had eaten, once in the shower while getting all the paint off and once more as she went to bed.</p>
<p>The next day Maya was happy to resign herself to simple nudity, her minor rebellion allowing her to concentrate on her boring job without other distractions. That night she did another painting of a nude woman standing on the roof of her office building with an incoming thunder-storm, it was done out of a frustrated need to vent at her normalised rebellion and was far from her best work. She went to the demo room to get paint stripper to return the canvas to a blank promise of creativity rather than this monument to mediocrity, when she saw a machine she had always wanted to use. As she stared her mind furnished her with a horrendously stupid use and she knew she had no alternative but to follow through on it.</p>
<p>The next day Maya worked with a speed and commitment she didn't know she had. She found enjoyment in the removal of barriers to her plan, each email and invoice was a hurdle to jump to get to the finish line. As she had hoped for, she had finished all her work by lunchtime. She left her email open and phone nearby before going to the supply closet with a tingle in her stomach.</p>
<p>As the engine came to life with a high pitched whine, Maya caressed the airbrush like her new best friend. She had put together a stoney grey paint mixture and poured some into the small reservoir on the nozzle, delighting in her plan going ahead. She stuck her leg out and felt goosebumps shiver to life over her body as the blast of air tickled her skin, leaving behind an even coat of paint.</p>
<p>Slowly Maya let her new friend breathe her skin to life, carefully running the airbrush over every inch of skin she could find, regularly stopping to refill the reservoir with more grey paint, and even getting a respectable coating of paint over her back and ass despite her difficulties reaching there. Once she had covered her whole body below the neck, she went to the mirror in the toilets to admire her work.</p>
<p>The effect was breathtaking, as far as Maya could discern her naked body looked just like it was made of stone. Maya was expecting to have to do some detailing with darker colours to sell the illusion but with her inconsistencies and uneven application, no matter how she shifted and posed, her head was attached to a body that looked like it had been carved Bernini or Michaelangelo (if they had been possessed of any interest in the female form). Her attention now turned to her head and for the first time she noticed a big problem, her hair.</p>
<p>Her first plan was to simply paint her hair as she had done the rest of her body, but looking closely she realised it wasn't just the colour of her hair that was the problem. Hair on statues was always inhumanly thick, sculptors unable to chisel out individual strands instead went for thick groupings just to show the flow of a hairstyle, making statues look like they were growing snakes from their head. Maya desperately ran back to the supply cupboard to try and find a way around this.</p>
<p>Maya slumped out of the supply cupboard feeling totally dejected, her mind could not wrap itself around a single way to get her hair out of the way. She went to the kitchen, hoping a snack would give her clarity or at least allow her to eat her frustrations while they ate away at her. She unwrapped leftovers from last night's meal and shoved it in the microwave. As she shook her hand to rid it of the cold cling film clasping on for dear life, her solution presented itself.</p>
<p>Maya tied her hair up in a bow, then wrapped cling film around her head, several times, tightly and comprehensively. She checked herself in the mirror and found a tuft of hair sticking out, so that bundle of cling film went into the bin and a new layer was applied, nothing less than perfection would do. Once she was happy that her hair was fully contained, it was time for her friend, the airbrush to finish the job. She doused the cling film with grey paint until the shine of the cling film was replaced with a full matte grey, before closing her eyes and letting her friend kiss every inch of her face.</p>
<p>From every angle, in every position, Maya looked into the mirror and saw a living statue looking back at her, she had transformed herself into a work of art, her naked body now a conduit for her expression. She imagined herself in art galleries, the masters and the public coming from miles around to admire the curves of her body. To talk with passion about her well proportioned breasts, her exquisite buttocks, how whichever artist created such a masterpiece was indeed a savant of the human form. She even heard the musings of why the artist had taken the drastic decision to make the statue bald a style more reminiscent of African sculptures. Such imaginings were interrupted by her immediate plans, dinner.</p>
<p>Maya got to the bottom of the order on her computer, she had gone through the mundanities of pizza toppings and payment details to get to the bit she had been looking forward to. Leaving some grey smudges on her keyboard she eagerly typed...</p>
<p>Delivery Instructions:</p>
<p>The door will be unlocked, please buzz to let us know you're here, then leave the pizza at the foot of the statue in the reception area and leave, closing the door behind you.</p>
<p>Maya clicked send and her plan was now at the point of no return, she grabbed a square white piece of wood usually used to keep the photo-copier from damaging the carpet and headed down to reception.</p>
<p>In the reception area Maya felt she had very little time to get ready, the delivery man would not be there for a while but the reception was still visible from the street and Maya was sure someone would notice a naked statue moving around inside. She hid her key fob behind the reception desk, before propping up her phone behind a fake plant the receptionist had brought from home. She faced the camera towards the corner she planned to stand in and hit record, for the illusion to work her eyes would need to be shut but she didn't want to miss the look on the delivery boy's face as he lay an offering of pizza at the feet of a living Venus.</p>
<p>She laid down the wooden board, a subtle part of her illusion that she was a work of art, and stood on it, shuffling her feet while trying to think of a position to stand in for the delivery man. At first she decided to stand in what she thought was a typical statue pose, arms wide and pointed, legs mid stride, but after holding the pose for a couple of seconds she saw her arm begin to shake with the effort. That wouldn't do. Next she tried sitting cross legged with her arms on her knees, a pose that brought to mind more eastern sculpting culture. After a while she felt the crossed legs hid too much and if he took a close look at her ass it would become clear that stone doesn't usually compress around the ground like that.</p>
<p>Eventually she found the right pose for her purpose, a traditional western power pose. She stood, legs apart, hands on hips, chest thrust forward and felt like a sculpture for female empowerment and liberation, no muscle was put under too much strain and she felt comfortable holding it.</p>
<p>Maya stood still, all that was left was to wait for the buzzer to signal the start of her performance. She didn't want to stare at the door as she knew she was visible from the entrance way so she simply stood and calmly controlled her breathing (didn't want a heaving bust to give the game away.) Suddenly the front buzzer chirped it's vicious trill, Maya closed her eyes and let the darkness swirl with her excitement.</p>
<p>The door opened. Footsteps grew louder. There was a pause. A long pause. The sound of a pizza box being placed on the floor. A mumble.</p>
<p>"Very nice."</p>
<p>Footsteps getting quieter. The door shut. Silence.</p>
<p>Maya took a deep gasping breath as she resurfaced in reality. Immediately sprinting to her phone to watch back what she couldn't see.</p>
<p>The video started with her experimenting with positions deciding on the pose and then being left standing in silence for a lot of time. Eventually the buzzer rang and Maya let out a little squeal as she lived vicariously through her past self.</p>
<p>A young man in a bright red blazer cautiously walked into the reception area, he stopped in front of Maya, and then he took some time to stare at her, his eyes examining her naked body. A young pizza deliverer taking a moment in a hum-drum evening of deliveries to appreciate a living breathing piece of art. He leaned around to take in the full majesty of Maya's body, then he leaned over to place the pizza on the floor, his eyes inches away from Maya's pussy.</p>
<p>He straightened up, mumbled his feedback, the words echoing through Maya's head, before leaving.</p>
<p>Maya took the pizza upstairs and barely touched it for the next hour as she rewatched the video over and over again, she poured herself some wine and drank in the joy of what she had been through. She felt her hand begin to lower itself between her legs but was able to stop herself, trying desperately not to let the friction of her hands or the juices of her vagina ruin the painted masterpiece her body had become.</p>
<p>As her mind swirled and her frustration built, Maya asked herself why she didn't want to spoil her paint. Yes it had taken some effort to put on but she had done what she had planned to do with it. She realised that it still wasn't enough, this masterpiece she had made herself into needed to be seen far and wide. She took her camera and propped it up facing a blank wall in the office, she set the timer and took one picture, head to toe of her in her power pose. Next she set the timer again and this time took a picture of herself in the same pose facing the other way. Front and back every inch of her was included in those two photographs.</p>
<p>Maya pulled up a website she regularly used to sell her artwork, created a new account, and then clicked the option to put up a sculpture for sale.</p>
<p>Piece name: Naked Ambition</p>
<p>Asking price: €30,000</p>
<p>(Maya knew at a price that high it would get a lot of attention but no offers)</p>
<p>Size: 145cm tall</p>
<p>Description: freedom, femininity, power. The world wants to portray these forces as irrelevant or impossible. This masterpiece presents all as one. Naked and unashamed, this piece stands firm and free. Empowered by her nudity, and freed by her power this item belongs in every gallery that wants to demonstrate the full complexity and courage of the female form.</p>
<p>The final box on the website was to attach photos, she selected the two of her full naked body and watched in jubilant horror as the upload bar ticked forward, her very essence being digitised to be copied and shared. The moment the photos had finished uploading she clicked submit without a millisecond of hesitation.</p>
<p>Maya topped up her glass of wine and stared at the advert she had just placed, finally deciding to grab a slice of the pizza she had ordered and totally forgotten in her bliss, a very acute example of the journey being more important than the destination she thought to herself. As she stared at her form, her mind a whirlwind of deviant and creative thoughts she took a bite of the pizza.</p>
<p>"Urgh, this is cold." Maya exclaimed to the office. "I guess I have no choice but to order another one."</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later Maya was still staring at the order summary on the screen, reeling at what she had signed herself up for. The sentence she read over and over again was, 'Delivery instructions: buzz the door and our statue will come and open it for you.' While she waited, Maya thought about the series of ones and zeros, interpreted by shapes made of silicon and metal to guide thousands of tiny pixels to display the same shapes on her screen as the screen in a pizza place. A series of technological marvels, reduced to mundanity by the demands of life, now holding power over her, bidding her to abide by her momentary impulse and show herself to the pizza delivery guy; naked, painted, and completely exposed.</p>
<p>The buzzer rang cold and demanding through the office, Maya picked up the phone and reassured the deliverer she would be right down. Her heartbeat was hard and steady as a coxswain, bidding her legs to keep pushing forward. As she got to the final flight of stairs before she would be visible she felt hesitancy pull on her motivation, she spoke out loud to herself to calm the voice of reason imprisoning her passion.</p>
<p>"I wanted to be a living work of art, well people have seen the art but they haven't seen I'm alive, I have yet to fully display my work to anyone. So it's time to be an artist."</p>
<p>Maya took the last step and turned the corner, the pizza guy was on the lookout for her but he certainly didn't expect a naked living statue. His eyes grew wider than Maya's smile as she opened the door.</p>
<p>"Fucking hell, that was you earlier?" He spluttered, remembering the statue he had admired earlier in his shift.</p>
<p>"Yes, you were kind to say I was very nice." Maya replied, attempting to seem graceful and aloof.</p>
<p>"Anyway, um, here's your pizza." The man held out the pizza box and averted his eyes, a sudden wave of bashfulness overcoming his curiosity.</p>
<p>"You don't need to look away, art is to be admired." Maya corrected, overjoyed that she was able to talk calmly and graciously despite her stomach backflipping around her body. The man did not need to be told twice and began to stare up and down Maya's body, examining every inch. "You didn't get to see my back last time." Maya observed, turning around to give him a view of her bottom.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"This is insane, nobody is going to believe me." The delivery man gawped.</p>
<p>"In which case how about you take some commemorative photographs? Art is to be shared after all." The delivery man's erection was so hard he struggled to fish his phone out of his pocket, but once he had it out Maya felt the flashes of his camera caress her body and preserve her creativity.</p>
<p>"Can I squeeze your breasts?" He asked, misreading the situation and getting far too comfortable.</p>
<p>"Hands behind the rope I'm afraid. They don't let viewers touch the art in galleries." Maya stated, trying to firmly establish the rules of the game in the delivery man's head, she was art and he needed to treat her as such. He immediately retracted his grasping hands and Maya was appreciative that even if he didn't understand the game he played by the rules. As a reward she casually tossed a tantalizing idea his way. "But art doesn't exist in a vacuum. The artist must appreciate the whims of their audience..."</p>
<p>As the man watched on, Maya took a firm hold on both of her breasts and squeezed them, letting out a moan of enjoyment as the delivery man licked his lips.</p>
<p>"Alright, so I bet artists struggle to think of which pose to put their statues in, so wouldn't it be artistic if the statue posed the way the audience wanted, like if I wanted to see a statue facing away from me but bending over and touching its toes." He had not chosen the most elegant of phraseology but he was getting the point and Maya was thrilled to play along. She turned around and leant forward, feeling her heart leap every time a flash of light confirmed another picture had been taken.</p>
<p>"That's good, but how about the statue tries sitting facing the audience, spread eagle, with its hands holding it's pussy open." The delivery man suggested. Maya was worried about how comfortable he was getting ordering her around, so agreed that this would be the last pose she did for him. She sat down and stared into his eyes as she widened her legs. As her hand began to spread her labia, revealing an explosion of pink in a sea of grey, it brushed against her clitoris and she felt a deep tingle of joy spark a wildfire that she knew could not be easily extinguished.</p>
<p>"OK now listen." Maya announced, trying to get ahead of the situation. "The gallery is about to close, but before you go the artist would like to give a special presentation. Please watch this expression of the underlying themes of her work." While the delivery man was still contemplating what she meant by that, Maya roughly plunged the fingers of her left hand into her drenched pussy, while she began to furiously rub her clitoris with her right hand. The effect was immediate and Maya skipped past the moaning stage straight the screams of ecstasy and delight as her high mindedness melted away to pure physical pleasure. Her life, her situation, even her body, it all fell to the wayside as she ascended to a ball of orgasmic joy, a scream of energy firing expressions of freedom into the universe, hoping that the other soul in the room could absorb a millionth of her psychic ambrosia.</p>
<p>When she opened her eyes the delivery man had one hand on his camera phone, and the other down his trousers. It was a base and simplistic appreciation of her artistic endeavors but all the best artists were misunderstood in their time. She gave herself a moment to catch her breath before calmly standing up.</p>
<p>"Thank you for coming, the exhibition is now closed." Maya announced. "We would be grateful if you emailed all photos and film footage to ********@****.***" The delivery guy nodded and was attaching all the media to an email as he walked out the door.</p>
<p>As the door closed behind the delivery man, Maya took a second to wait for him to be out of sight before dropping her facade and bouncing up and down the adrenaline, squealing with the long term memories she had just created. Deciding there was no way to top the experience she just had, she made her way to the shower to wash her jubilation off her skin, and indulge a pussy that continued to scream for attention.</p>
<p>After the dizzying highs of her day as a statue, Maya felt comfortable slipping back into a routine. She ordered some clothes online and once they arrived she used them to go to Felipe's and pick up the rest of her things. From then on her spare time was spent either trying to find a new apartment to move into, or reading and re-reading every gushing comment on the site where she had put her naked body for sale.</p>
<p>"Exquisite craftsmanship on a powerful and unique piece, if I ever have a spare €30,000 I'll certainly be back." Her favourite comment read. She was overjoyed at the first rush of private offers, people trying to haggle but desperately wanting her naked form to be standing in their house or gallery. One person even went as high as €10,000, a grand ego booster for Maya.</p>
<p>As much as Maya tried and tried she couldn't find an apartment, with the lockdown and the ensuing economic problems people were not eager to move so the only houses available were the dregs that were difficult to shift before lockdown began. Maya had become comfortable enough with staying at work that although she didn't want it to be a long term thing, she had no objection choosing it over a substandard house. Then came the email that made her soak with dread, not the food kind of fear that she had played with as she experimented with her creativity and sexuality, a genuine deep fear of what she was about to lose.</p>
<p>'The government has announced a phased return to work.' She read in horror. 'So although we will still provide for people who wish to work from home, we want to start returning people to the office. On Monday we will be asking for everyone to come in to discuss how our working arrangements will evolve in these trying times.' Maya scanned the page over and over again, her mind swirling with a complex spectrum of frustrated emotions.</p>
<p>"Fuck!" Was all she was able to say, so well did this word sum up her feelings that she would go on to repeat it several times.</p>
<p>Maya was able to take her workers blanket to a laundromat, give the office a quick wash and spray, before moving all her bags and boxes to the vacant lot on the ground floor. Monday morning she woke up very early and went for a long walk, returning to the office at 9am when she was due to arrive, hoping to ensure nobody was suspicious that she was living there.</p>
<p>"Maya, can I see you in my office?" Her boss asked the moment she came through the door, something that was not a good sign. Maya shuffled into his office, desperately trying to think of what she had overlooked. As she came through the door she realised she hadn't taken down her painting, her boss was stood there pointing at Maya's representation of draping herself naked over the desks. "Did you paint this?"</p>
<p>"Sorry sir it is. When I had the place to myself I decided to use your office to get work done, and I decided to put a painting on the wall to make it more mine. I'll take it away." Maya sputtered, reaching for her painting.</p>
<p>"Not so fast Maya, don't worry you're not in trouble, in fact I love this painting, it really brings to life what I was aiming for when I decided on the office decor. I would like to purchase it with some of our facilities budget and leave it hanging here, how does €500 sound?" Maya couldn't believe what she was hearing, the money was flattering but to her the greatest compliment was that now her naked body would become a permanent fixture in the office. She agreed and deep down felt more whole than any time in her life.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>As the world began to open up again Maya found a new well of confidence with the control she had established in her life. She started modelling for life drawing classes alongside her other arrangements and her naked form found itself in more and more of her paintings. Eventually she did find an apartment of her own, overlooking a nice park that her naked body regularly found itself in.</p>
<p>She kept the sculpture advertisement up and continued to take joy in the attention, until one day she received an email that she both dreaded and was looking forward to.</p>
<p>'dear seller,</p>
<p>I always study each piece of art carefully on this website and I am now certain that what I am looking at is a real woman painted to look like a statue. I'm not sure what your purpose was uploading such a thing but that doesn't mean I am not intrigued.</p>
<p>I own a small gallery in Valencia, and I would like to pay your model €2000 to pose as a statue in my gallery for a week.' beneath this he had left contacts details and arrangements that clearly showed he was serious about his offer.</p>
<p>Maya stared at the screen for what seemed like hours, psyching herself up to do what her heart truly desired. She opened up a reply email and tried to figure out the most nonchalant way of accepting his offer, her mind clouded thoughts of crowds of people encircling her naked body.</p>
<p>She was going to be a work of art.</p>
