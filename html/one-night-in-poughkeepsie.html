<p>Note: This story has been submitted for the "One Night" event, organized by ChloeTzang, which called for Literotica authors to compose a story taking place over one night in a city or town of their choice.</p>
<p>What's the most erotic thing I've ever done? Ha! Where should I start?</p>
<p>I'll tell you what. Do you remember Paul Freeman? I wouldn't have any stories to tell if it weren't for what happened to us that one night. I suppose that's how my whole kinky side came out in the first place...</p>
<p>I was back home for the wedding of my childhood friends, Cassie and Michael. Have you ever been to Poughkeepsie? Years ago, I'd have told you not to bother. It's not so bad now, what with the walkway over the Hudson and all the new restaurants and breweries. Granted, it's not the prettiest city and it certainly doesn't have any reputation for being the most exciting place on Earth. But then again, who really knows what goes on behind closed doors?</p>
<p>A bunch of us descended upon Poughkeepsie, gobbling up the discounted hotel rooms so we didn't have to stay with our parents or worry about getting home crazy drunk. It's always weird returning home after you've started a new life elsewhere. Many of us were ready to flaunt our glamorous new identities, the ones that developed since we got the hell out of there. We'd mingle with old friends who'd never left, equally excited to tell us all about how the city had changed and about the urban renaissance we'd been missing.</p>
<p>One thing would never change: it was still home. A home where the little legend I was about to produce would go on to live in infamy, twisting endlessly into all sorts of half-truths. That's how gossip works!</p>
<p>Cassie and Mike had a typical wedding. Lots of white. A choice between beef and fish. A panoply of flowers. I consoled myself with cake. You know how those things go when you don't have a date. I joined a group of unmarried friends and we just prattled on about the ones that were.</p>
<p>Anyway, part of me enjoyed those excuses to see the old gang because Paul was always there. More importantly, he was still single. We'd had a flirtatious thing going for years by then. Each time I saw him it felt like it progressed a little more. I wasn't sure where it was going, if anywhere at all. I gazed at him throughout the hotel wedding reception.</p>
<p>Eventually, Cassie and Mike started making the rounds for their final thank-yous, even though the drunken celebration would still go on late into the evening. I had my eyes set on another glass of Sauvignon Blanc. Then Paul and I crossed paths. I take it he was thirsty...</p>
<p>"Hi, Paul!" I said, cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Hey Amy!" he replied.</p>
<p>"So... crazy. I haven't been in this place in years. It doesn't look exactly like I remember," I said, putting pressure on myself to prompt some chit-chat.</p>
<p>"Yeah, they spruced it up a little bit a few years ago with a renovation but it's still an old relic... My room though-- wow!"</p>
<p>"Oh?" I said, wondering if he scored himself some kind of free upgrade.</p>
<p>"Yeah. There's heat... water. A beautiful view of the parking lot," he mused.</p>
<p>"Incredible!" I laughed.</p>
<p>"I know! I have my own bathroom. Oh! And get this-- a vintage lamp!"</p>
<p>"A lamp!" I gasped.</p>
<p>"And it's beautiful," he sighed. Paul raised his hands as if framing a picture. "It gives off this amber glow like you're in a field of wheat as the sun sets."</p>
<p>"Gosh, why can't all hotels be like that..." I gigged, delighted by his wacky sense of humor.</p>
<p>"Seriously. And the best thing is the bed. You've never seen such a thing. I feel like I'm a member of royalty."</p>
<p>"Aha..." I replied, trying to hide my smirk with a sip of wine.</p>
<p>"No, really..." He paused for a moment as if trying to figure out how to make a joke about proving it to me. I could tell he was a little nervous. "You wouldn't have any interest in skipping out on this party for a bit, would you?" he settled on, perhaps realizing how forward he was becoming.</p>
<p>"Oh-- um..." I mumbled, quickly taking another sip of wine, even though I had only just swallowed the previous one. I felt it rush down my throat, making an embarrassingly loud gulping sound.</p>
<p>What can I say? I panicked. I plain ol' dropped the ball, right then and there, turning against all my dreams and fantasies in one botched opportunity to communicate what I actually felt inside.</p>
<p>"Uh... maybe another time. I'm feeling a little dizzy right now," I stammered. After I realized what I'd just said, I actually did feel a little dizzy. "See ya later," I squeaked as I turned and darted around a table, leaving Paul standing there solemn and stone-faced.</p>
<p>I scrambled off to the other side of the room, feeling my heart thumping madly in my chest, immediately regretting what I just did. "What was I thinking?!" I thought to myself. I began to review my life, pointing out all the times I had been that much of an idiot if only to lessen the pain of what I had just done.</p>
<p>I found Alexis, Rebecca, Lauren, and Jacqueline standing in a circle by the dance floor and rushed over to join them.</p>
<p>"Don't you guys ever feel weird seeing the bride and groom off?" Rebecca was saying.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Alexis asked.</p>
<p>"Well, it's not like we don't know what Cassie and Mike are headed up to their room for... They're gonna fuuuuuck. And they're gonna fuuuck, and fuck, and fuck, and fuck." She sighed and took a sip of wine while everyone laughed.</p>
<p>"That's funny," Jacqueline said. "It's so true." I could see her helplessly daring to picture the lewd scene in her head. "Oh my god, I can't even think about that!" she suddenly added.</p>
<p>"... While we stand around here talking about it like losers," Alexis added.</p>
<p>Lauren lowered her wine glass from her lips, revealing a wry grin. "Speak for yourselves!" she laughed.</p>
<p>"Oh! Yes, good for you bringing the handsome boyfriend," Alexis groaned sarcastically. "Enjoy your fucking evening..." Lauren snickered at her.</p>
<p>"Uh, guys... speaking of which..." I said, finally coming to terms with what I'd just done. Everyone turned and looked at me. I could tell their interest was piqued.</p>
<p>"What?" Rebecca asked, impatiently.</p>
<p>"Paul kinda... um... just asked me up to his room," I replied. The four of them stood there motionless, staring at me as if I had cocktail sauce all over my face.</p>
<p>"And you're standing here with us for exactly what reason?!" Alexis blurted out.</p>
<p>"I don't know!" I exclaimed. They were instantly animated, exchanging looks of shock and shaking their heads in disbelief. "I don't know why I didn't go! I guess I panicked. Help! What do I do?!"</p>
<p>"Jesus, Amy... You better figure it out before I do!" Alexis quipped, her eyes suddenly fixated on Paul all the way across the room, where he had taken a seat with a bunch of our old guy friends. I slapped my forehead and continued to whine.</p>
<p>"Go back over there then. Tell him you changed your mind!" Jacqueline suggested.</p>
<p>"Yeah, like I'm gonna just walk over to him and say, 'let's go, hot stuff' in front of everyone..." I mumbled.</p>
<p>"Well, lure him away. See if he wants another drink or something," Rebecca added.</p>
<p>"He just got one," I said with a pout.</p>
<p>"God, Amy. You're crazy. Just go and figure it out," Lauren groaned. "You're horny for him, he's horny for you. Let's make this work." She secured the stem of her glass with her thumb so she could run a finger back and forth through the hole of her other fist in a suggestive manner.</p>
<p>I laughed. "Okay, fine... I'll figure something out," I said, not convincing anyone.</p>
<p>I wandered across the room, weaving in and out of the half-empty tables where small discussions were still taking place between family and friends. I ended up at the spread of hors d'oeuvres 'cuz, you know: food. I skipped over all the fancy stuff and arrived at a big bowl of corn chips and salsa that I couldn't bear to see go to waste. I started nervously munching on them, eying Paul from a distance. He was listening to an apparently amusing discussion, occasionally chuckling at someone's comment.</p>
<p>"God, you're so fucking hot," I mumbled to myself between loud crunches. I began to telepathically reach out to him. "Look at me, dammit," I thought. For some reason, I started eating the next chip seductively. I must have looked like a complete dork. "Look at me, the sexy idiot munching on corn chips in desperation."</p>
<p>All of a sudden he glanced over at me. He did a double-take, casting a look back and forth between me and those gathered around his table. I made another loud crunch. He gave me a funny look like he was confused.</p>
<p>"Shit, come on Amy..." I said to myself. I made a small motion with my hand, gesturing at him to come over. Paul raised an eyebrow. He turned briefly and said something to our friends, then got up and wandered over.</p>
<p>"Hey, what's up?" he asked as a small smile began to form on his face. I realized I had not prepared what I was going to say.</p>
<p>"Uh... so... I um... maybe said something earlier that I didn't mean to say..."</p>
<p>"Oh?" he replied. Paul looked like I had just resuscitated him from a near-death experience.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I think I tried to say, 'yes' or something, but it came out as 'no'."</p>
<p>"Really..." he said, drawing the word out slowly. "Would you like to try it again?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Okay... Well... do you wanna skip out on this party for a bit?"</p>
<p>I put my wine glass down on the table behind me, wiped my palms against my dress, and took a deep breath in. "Yes," I said with a nervous smile.</p>
<p>"Well then, let's go... You can try out my lamp!" Paul laughed. He grabbed my hand and quickly led us toward the exit as if afraid I would change my mind.</p>
<p>I glanced back over my shoulder. Alexis, Rebecca, Lauren, and Jacqueline were still standing across the room in a circle, babbling on about who-knows-what. Rebecca looked up and saw us leaving. She started jumping up and down and pointing frantically toward us. They all turned and I saw their faces light up.</p>
<p>Suddenly I was in the hallway.</p>
<p>Paul and I made our way through the hotel, back to the lobby, and stopped in front of the long bank of elevators. "I should warn you... I may have corn chip breath," I said, trying to make a joke. It wasn't funny. I just felt embarrassed and stupid.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Paul laughed. "That's okay. I should warn you that I might be a little drunk."</p>
<p>"Clearly," I said with a grin, fully aware what had made him so bold at long last. "That's okay. Me too." The elevator dinged and the doors slid open. We stepped inside.</p>
<p>"Is that what this is about?" he asked, grinning back at me. "Are you trying to take advantage of me?"</p>
<p>"You're the one that invited me!"</p>
<p>"Huh. I distinctly remember you calling me over to--"</p>
<p>"Oh, I see. Trying to turn this back on me, are we?" We both laughed.</p>
<p>I felt myself becoming suddenly excited. So excited that I imagined this might actually turn out well after all. No. Excited is not the right word. I was horny.</p>
<p>Paul made me so fucking horny. I hadn't been that desperate for satisfaction since those lonely trips back home for the holidays where I lamented the lack of action I was getting at college. All I ended up doing was pulling out my old hairbrush, my favorite stuffed animal, a folded pillow... I even tried getting it on with my hilariously dick-shaped bedpost, despite once telling myself never to try that again. It was like I'd regressed to my awkward teenage years all over again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, we were at the door to Paul's room. He waved the key card. I saw the green light and heard the lock click. Paul swung the door open wide and stepped aside, waving his arm through the air as if to unveil the grand majesty of his rather ordinary room.</p>
<p>"Why, thank you," I exclaimed, attempting to waltz inside with a bit of panache.</p>
<p>To say that I was anxious would be an understatement. I was inside for no more than thirty seconds before I confessed I had to go to the bathroom. I was sure he could tell that I was a complete mess but I needed to lock myself in there for a few minutes just to work up the nerve to face the situation. I sat there on the toilet trying to sort out how drunk I was and if I was about to do something stupid.</p>
<p>Listening to the hiss as I emptied my bladder, all I could think was, "He can probably hear me." But for all I knew that would turn him on. "Whatever floats your boat, dude," I mused. "As long as this happens." And it was really happening.</p>
<p>I forced myself to go back out there. Paul was still standing right where I left him, stiff as a rod. His whole body, I mean... I realized that I had been so focused on my own anxiety that I hadn't noticed his.</p>
<p>"So... hey... um," I started.</p>
<p>He smirked. Little shadows formed amidst his smooth stubble. They weren't quite dimples but they were just as lethal. I walked right up to him, perhaps a little too close. That's all I needed to do, apparently. Suddenly we were at each other's lips. You know that feeling you get when that warm magnetism starts flowing back and forth through your body?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I gave into his kiss completely. My heart was thumping. For a moment, all my giddy humor vanished. This was serious. I had his tongue to prove it. After we finished sucking face, Paul reached around me and pulled me in close. I found myself drowning happily in the fading scent of his expensive cologne.</p>
<p>"This feels good..." he sighed.</p>
<p>"Mmm, yeah," I mumbled. "But if you don't let me go, I won't be able to tear all your clothes off," I added with a nervous laugh. There it was, back again. When I get nervous, I try to make a joke and usually make a fool of myself. I felt myself getting a hot flash as I realized what I'd just said.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Paul laughed and then let me go. I suddenly found myself in the precarious position of having to make good on my threat. I remember giving him a hard stare before I reached for his belt. All at once, I was unbuckling it and he was wrestling off my dress. I was popping the buttons along his chest like my life depended on it.</p>
<p>Did I say that Paul made me horny? I wanted to push him onto the bed, climb onto his body, and ride what I imagined was his big, beautiful cock in the same manner that Mabel Strickland once rode those bucking broncos on the rodeo circuit.</p>
<p>I felt him pop my bra, the rush of air on my nipples. He got my panties off and then tugged down his boxers. Naked as we both were, I hadn't even looked at his body yet. I wasn't yet done with his eyes. I felt penetrated by him already; deep, coffee brown, smooth as a fine cognac. They meandered downward. I watched them expand and evolve as he explored my newly-revealed secrets.</p>
<p>I touched his chest. Paul was solid, tall, and muscular. I felt myself tingling already. I briefly moved up against him. My nipples pressed into his flesh like darts. I felt the heat emanating from his body as I began to slide my hand downward, over his stomach. His bellybutton was a sweet curl vanishing into darkness. I followed a little trail of hair, leading downward...</p>
<p>And there was his cock. I slipped my hand over it, admiring the perfect grooming of his smoothly cropped pubic hair. I felt his long shaft interrupting my fingers. They slipped underneath to cup his balls, shaved so smooth and soft. I lowered myself in front of him, still frequently searching for his eyes.</p>
<p>There I lifted his long shaft and inhaled his musk. I felt him begin to swell. He lengthened in my hand, becoming steely hard. I watched that magnificent specimen try to escape from my grasp, ticking higher and higher into the air as it began to throb. I chased after it, aware of the silly grin on my face, but even more conscious of his elongated, veiny shaft, his thick girth, the soft blush of his bulbous, ridged cockhead.</p>
<p>I planted a soft kiss at the tip of his erect penis. Then another, caressing him softly and teasing him with the brief, featherlight touch of my lips. He began to shift his weight and sigh. When I'd had enough of my own cruelty, I finally wrapped my lips around his cock and eased it into my mouth, feeling the deep pulse of his arousal tenderly adoring my tongue.</p>
<p>I moved smoothly against him, gradually increasing my pressure and speed. I tasted the salty evidence of his pleasure as he swelled to maximum capacity in the warm hollow of my mouth. I heard the quiet moans escaping his lips as my tongue curled around his shaft and worked hard to polish him smooth.</p>
<p>Careful not to work him into too wild a frenzy just yet, I eventually paused and grinned up at him. He cast me a pleading, desperate look. But I rose to greet his face. "Yep, I just went there and did that," I thought. I wanted to congratulate myself.</p>
<p>He reached forward and slid his hands over my body. I felt him caress my breasts, gazing down at them lovingly and full of so much wonder. I shivered in response to his absolute astonishment, slipping his fingers over my nipples, delighted with their firmness.</p>
<p>Mild insecurity entered my mind as he lowered his eyes downward. I hadn't shaved but it could have been so much worse. Paul didn't seem to mind at all. He stroked his fingers through my pubic hair, then delicately parted my lips. I felt his fingers slide over my pussy. I watched his eyes dart back and forth, enamored by my silken flesh, already wet with anticipation.</p>
<p>Defenseless, a loud moan escaped my lips. Suddenly his eyes met mine. They sharpened. His eyebrows arched with a wicked determination. Without warning, Paul scooped me up in his arms and carried me toward the bed. I shrieked and wrapped my arms around his neck, glancing back as if I actually needed to be sure that the bed would be there to catch me when he plopped me back down.</p>
<p>I landed with a soft thud and allowed the abrupt contact to split my legs apart. He seemed thrilled by my boldness and hunger. Decidedly impatient, I wanted him to see me that way.</p>
<p>Paul gazed down at my expanding sex with a glow about him that I'd never seen before. His hand slipped down to caress my thigh as he moved toward the sensuous intimacy of my body that I had just presented to him. And oh god-- no guy had ever eaten my pussy like that before. He went into it slow. First tickling my inner thigh. Making me want it all the more urgently.</p>
<p>His tongue began its serpentine weave, with a teasing avoidance of my clit. I felt it slip across my flesh, splitting me open, navigating my slippery folds as I squirmed and tingled. Then he swept it across my burning nub and set my whole body on fire. He tortured me with brisk flicks of the tongue. He sucked at my labia, anxious for my sweet nectar.</p>
<p>I wanted him to worship and adore me to the point of drunkenness. I wanted my body to offer him nothing short of ambrosia from a goddess.</p>
<p>Oddly, I remember sinking so deep into the pleasure that he was giving me that these weird memories startled bubbling up through my consciousness. I kept thinking of all the times I had stayed at hotels like that one, imagining a guy picking me up at the bar for a risky, casual encounter. It never actually happened. I remembered how many times I had instead ended up masturbating like a loser on the cool white bed sheets, frantically whipping my hand between my legs as if aggressively trying to prolong that fantasy in my head rather than slipping back into the bleak starkness of reality.</p>
<p>I remembered all the other fantasies I had. Most notably the one where I cracked the door to my room open, peeking out into the hallway, briefly stepping outside without any clothes on to risk getting caught. I never understood why but that one always made me come the hardest. I felt the fear, the anticipation, the thrill of someone finding me like that and getting turned on themselves. It made me want to explode.</p>
<p>I wanted to explode right then and there, all over Paul.</p>
<p>But he pulled away suddenly, licking his lips with satisfaction and giving me a serious look of intense craving. He whispered, "Let me go grab a condom."</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>I watched as he turned, transfixed by his muscular glutes, the rise and fall of his firm buttocks as he strolled away from the bed. I think I lost control of myself at that moment -- and that's when I made that one little slip which sent the entire night into disarray. The one that turned my long sought-after escapade with this perfect man I crushed on into an experience the likes of which I could never have imagined for someone such as myself.</p>
<p>In my infinite wisdom, I blurted out, "Wait."</p>
<p>He turned back around and gave me a surprised look. As if searching for ways to draw out our playful debauchery, thus ensuring a long night of the most incredible sex I'd ever have, I suggested, "Can we try something first?" I remember biting my lip and giving him a naughty look to seal the deal.</p>
<p>He seemed intrigued. "Try what?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I've always wanted to do this -- but I need someone with me. If you guard the door, do you want to see me sneak out in the hallway... naked?"</p>
<p>Paul's face lit up. "Wow, I didn't know you were that kinky!" he exclaimed. It was clear that the thought of it made him as aroused as it did me. "Let's try it," he added.</p>
<p>I laughed and threw myself off the bed. Even giddier than before, I raced across the room toward the door, amusing myself with the scandal of my swinging boobs in preparation for the thrill of risking an audience for them other than Paul. It was like I had suddenly gotten in touch with myself. My secret fantasy life that I always dismissed now had an urge to materialize, to come alive and blossom into the world.</p>
<p>Paul crept up behind me, full of as much tension and excitement as I was. We were like two teenagers sneaking off to do something naughty together for the first time.</p>
<p>"Ready?" I asked, glancing up at him with a wicked twinkle in my eye.</p>
<p>"I think so..." he muttered, gritting his teeth with anxious anticipation.</p>
<p>I opened the door a crack. The bright light of the hallway flooded through and zipped across my painted toes. At first, I just listened. Silence. I grew a little bolder and peeked through. I didn't see anything but the room across the way. I opened the door a little more and stuck my head out. I felt my hair falling all over my bare shoulders, reminding me of my complete nudity. To the left and right there was only a long, empty hallway with an ugly carpet stretching from end to end, like something out of The Shining.</p>
<p>"Okay, no one's there..." I exhaled with a nervous breath.</p>
<p>"Okay, hurry, I'll hold the door," Paul said.</p>
<p>"Here goes..." I whispered. I took another glance up and down the hallway, then I quickly tugged the door open wider and bolted out of the room.</p>
<p>I remember turning around and looking back at Paul's face, staring in disbelief at me through the wide crack of the door. His expression exploded into amusement as I twirled in a circle, waved my ass at him, and then threw my hands up in the air. I couldn't believe the sense of complete freedom! All I could think of was that at any minute one of the doors might open and a complete stranger could walk out, startled to find some crazy woman dancing about with her boobs and pussy out.</p>
<p>"Come on, you can step outside and still hold the door," I said, racing forward to tug at him. I was desperate to have him feel what I was feeling.</p>
<p>"Wait, you'll..." he blurted out, stumbling forward.</p>
<p>"Come on! Don't be a prude!" I teased. "Just hold it with your other hand!"</p>
<p>Paul put up a fight but he was still laughing, so I felt I could get away with getting him out of his comfort zone. In my mind, I imagined us taking this leap together, surprising ourselves with a mutual rashness and sense of adventure. I had it all laid out in my head. We'd panic together, then rush back into the room, have a hearty laugh about it, and then fuck like rabbits.</p>
<p>But that's not how it happened.</p>
<p>Frustrated by Paul's reluctance, I tugged a little too hard. He took one step too many. I heard a soft click and my heart sank. We both froze as we realized what happened. And by a goddamn centimeter! His foot and arm were still against the door, ready to keep it safely ajar.</p>
<p>"No..." I gasped as I threw my hands over my mouth.</p>
<p>"Fuck... don't tell me the--" I heard him say as he spun around, his foot still anchored in place against the door. He grabbed the doorknob and pushed at it frantically. Suddenly, he started jostling it and slamming his shoulder into the door. It all became real the moment he stepped his foot away and acknowledged the nightmare that had just occurred.</p>
<p>"Fuck!" he said again.</p>
<p>"Shhh!" I hissed. "Someone will hear you and come out!"</p>
<p>I stumbled backward, thrusting my hand as securely as I could over my hairy crotch and wrapping the other arm across my boobs. I simply wanted to die. Up and down the hallway I looked with feverish anxiety. No one was there but somehow I felt sure that at any moment the entire floor would spill out into the hallway to laugh and point at us.</p>
<p>"What do we do?!" I asked, frantically.</p>
<p>"I don't know! Let's go down the hall and see if we can find a place to hide until we figure it out," he said. We rushed down the shorter end of the hallway, turned a corner, and found a small alcove with a Coke machine. We ducked behind it and stood there shaking. "Maybe a maid will come by or something," Paul added.</p>
<p>"Um... that could take a while," I grumbled.</p>
<p>Paul searched around, then spotted the service elevator. "I mean... should we try that? We could take it to the basement or something. We have to find someone!"</p>
<p>I felt my stomach twisting in knots. This had been my fault. I felt awful. Yet somehow I still felt turned on. I couldn't really make sense of it. "Okay, go -- go!" I exclaimed, prodding him toward the elevator door.</p>
<p>When the service elevator arrived there was no one inside. We rushed in and stood on a dingy, scuffed mat. The doors closed and we found ourselves in a gross, steel box plummeting into the bowels of the hotel, carrying our naked bodies with us. It was the strangest sensation I'd ever felt. I didn't recognize the labels on the buttons. Were we supposed to go to "B" or "SB"? When the door finally opened, would we find ourselves standing in front of a throng of gobsmacked hotel staffers?</p>
<p>When the doors finally did open, we stepped out into an empty hallway in some employees-only area. There didn't seem to be anyone out. The hallway was cold. The lights flickered. I wanted to kill that infernal, constant humming.</p>
<p>"Maybe the laundry is down here," Paul suggested as he hurried down the hall. I had to tell myself to stop looking at his butt as he performed a slight jog ahead of me. I felt guilty for still being turned on while we were on the verge of absolute humiliation.</p>
<p>He tried a door but it didn't open. The next one was also locked.</p>
<p>"I can smell chlorine," I said, deeply inhaling the air.</p>
<p>"Yeah, me too. I guess we're near the pool?" he said.</p>
<p>A little further down the hall, there was another door that confirmed our suspicions. It was covered in chipped blue paint. The word, "POOL" was painted in red at the center. It looked like it had been hastily labeled some fifty years ago.</p>
<p>"Try it, try it," I said as we stopped in front.</p>
<p>Paul reached for the knob and started saying, "If we catch someone, we can ask them to run and get us towels and--"</p>
<p>I remember seeing the door opening and had this sense of mild relief. However, it didn't last long. Paul was still looking at me and babbling about something but my eyes were fixed squarely on that door as it swung open to reveal a hallway on the other side. Indeed, we had found the pool. A long window several feet in front of us looked out upon the glistening blue rectangle and its colorful lane dividers.</p>
<p>But that's not all that was on the other side.</p>
<p>A young woman strolled by in her bathing suit. It clung to her body as if she had just climbed out of the pool; her petite breasts were like two dark apples coated in a black, polyester sheen. A lanky, shirtless guy, whom I soon presumed to be her brother, strolled up behind her. I saw his feet slowing as his sister turned and froze. He bumped into her. They couldn't have been more than twenty years old. Their eyes bugged out in their sockets as if trying to process what they were suddenly looking at.</p>
<p>Then I heard the girl gasp, reacting with a start to the sight of our naked bodies. In the corner of my eye, I saw Paul's head turning, about to register what we'd just walked into.</p>
<p>"Let's go, guys, hurry up and get chang--" I heard a woman's voice saying as if confused why they had stopped there. A man and woman appeared out of nowhere and came to a screeching halt. The father did a double-take and adjusted his glasses. We found ourselves standing there butt naked in front of an entire family.</p>
<p>I remember feeling absolutely mortified. However, it was also exhilarating to be caught like that! It was as if the very thing I feared was exactly what I secretly wanted to happen. "So what did you see on your family vacation?" I imagined someone asking them later.</p>
<p>The mother suddenly looked down at Paul's penis. Worse, she then looked over to discover her daughter busily memorizing every feature of it. I couldn't imagine what they must be thinking standing there frozen in shock with a long, flaccid cock and my hairy muff staring back at them. I felt bad for the young guy in front of me.</p>
<p>"Nice bulge there, kid," I was thinking.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Paul said, interrupting the brief silence that somehow felt like an eternity. "I-- uh-- shit! Sorry!" he exclaimed, swinging the door shut.</p>
<p>The last thing I saw before the family vanished was a young woman still staring between Paul's legs with cautious curiosity. "Keep dreamin' girl. You'll have your chance someday. I worked hard for this one," I mumbled to myself.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I snorted and laughed out loud.</p>
<p>"You're laughing?!" Paul exclaimed, looking at me incredulously. His face was red with humiliation. I realized he hadn't seen the humor in the situation like I did, nor the unexpected erotic thrill. Or maybe he just wasn't willing to acknowledge it yet.</p>
<p>"Sorry!" I said, still unable to control my laughter. "But wait! Ask them to help!"</p>
<p>"Oh-- right!" Paul said, lunging for the door again. This time he opened it a crack and peeked out. "Fuck..." he said. I figured it was no surprise that they weren't standing there anymore.</p>
<p>"Let's go back up the elevator. I'm ready to just knock on someone's door at this point," Paul said, hurrying back down the hall. I chased after him. I'm sure there were any number of ways we could have resolved our situation but who could think clearly at a time like that?</p>
<p>We got back into the elevator and pressed the button for our floor. I burst into a fit of hysterics again.</p>
<p>"How can you find this funny?!" he asked, now starting to laugh himself like a hypocrite.</p>
<p>I took one look at the grin on his face and bent in half, giving myself a cramp from so much guffawing. "Which part, the bug-eyed girl you just corrupted, or the poor kid I just made cream his pants in front of his entire family?"</p>
<p>Paul erupted into laughter. "Stop it, you're killing me!" he struggled to get out. The door slid open and we found ourselves back in the friendly glow of the Coke machine. We exited and stood there measuring the amount of silence in the hallway. "Well, that was a productive little expedition we just took," he whispered with a grin.</p>
<p>"Was it as good for you as it was for me?" I joked.</p>
<p>Paul chuckled. "I suppose we just earned the right to tell people we've streaked naked through a hotel before."</p>
<p>"Well, it was on my bucket list, after all," I giggled.</p>
<p>We got a hold of ourselves and quieted down. I suddenly felt victorious. I stood there with newfound confidence. Had I consumed just one more glass of wine before we left the party, I might have even suggested that we stroll right back out there to greet all our friends in our birthday suits.</p>
<p>"Wait a second," I gasped.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Well, Lauren's also staying on this floor. I know what room she's in. Maybe she and Conner have come back to their room by now."</p>
<p>"Oh, geez. Okay, which room?"</p>
<p>"This way!" I exclaimed, rushing back out into the hallway and wagging my rear end with a devilish swagger. After peeking around the corner and confirming that the path was clear, I led Paul quickly past his room and onward until we neared Lauren's.</p>
<p>I stopped short when I heard a door opening. Paul bumped into my bare ass and froze there. To our surprise, it was Lauren's door that had just swung open. Conner, her boyfriend, stepped out into the hallway with his back to us.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Babe. I'll check and be right back!" he was saying. He let the door go and hurried off in the other direction, toward the elevator, completely oblivious to our presence.</p>
<p>Paul rushed past me and lunged for the door as it swung shut. He caught the knob just before it closed and gestured to me to get inside. We threw ourselves into the room and heard the door shut behind us. A sense of relief washed over me. I gave Paul a now-what look. He stared back at me with a dumbfounded expression.</p>
<p>I slapped my forehead and crept forward. Just around the corner, I knew Lauren was probably standing there, about to get the shock of her life. However, I felt a little titillated with the idea that Paul and I might just walk out there into the room the way we were. Secretly, I wanted her to see him naked. The idea of giving her a little tease felt hilarious. After all, it was just Lauren, whom we had known our entire lives.</p>
<p>After waffling in our silent discussion for a minute or two, I just grabbed Paul's arm and gave him a tug. He dug his feet into the carpet, as if to say, "what are you doing?!" but quickly relented. I dragged him forward and the two of us stumbled into the center of the room, then turned.</p>
<p>Lauren lay there in the bed, bathed in the amber glow of the vintage lamp switched on next to her. She gasped and suddenly tugged the sheets up to her neck. Although nothing had been revealed, it was immediately apparent that she was naked and we'd just stumbled upon their own little sexual tryst.</p>
<p>I saw Lauren's sanity seem to shatter right in front of me. For several moments, her eye twitched and her mouth dropped open. A little smile came to her lips, then faded, then crept back more cautiously than before.</p>
<p>"Wh--wh--" she began to spit out.</p>
<p>Paul and I exchanged a brief look, then glanced back toward her, not sure quite how to feel about her laying there with our completely nude bodies fully on display just a few feet away.</p>
<p>"I can explain," I started to say, putting my hand up in the air as if to try to stop her from saying a word.</p>
<p>"Wh- what the fuck-- Amy!" she sputtered, nevertheless.</p>
<p>"As I said, there's an explanation for--" I continued with a sense of mild amusement.</p>
<p>I paused briefly as I saw Lauren's gaze lower down between Paul's legs, her eyes blinking as if shell-shocked. I suppose she couldn't help herself. I followed her gaze right down to Paul's body where his cock hung there like a fat, limp kielbasa.</p>
<p>"Oh. Okay. No-- go ahead and check out the goods. I'll just stand here and wait for you to help us get out of this fucking nightmare," I groaned, crossing my arms over my chest and leaning onto one foot.</p>
<p>Paul and Lauren both turned red.</p>
<p>"No-- I wasn't. I mean--" Lauren quickly snapped. "What the fuck are you both doing here-- and why the hell are you both butt naked?!"</p>
<p>"So, funny story--" I said, finally able to narrate the ridiculous course of events that had just transpired. Just then I heard the click of a lock. "Oh man..." I thought as I heard the sound of Conner's footsteps behind us.</p>
<p>"Can you believe they don't sell them here?!" he was saying as he turned the corner.</p>
<p>I could hear him stop short, no doubt startled by the sight of two unfamiliar, bare bottoms arranged side by side. Conner raced around to the front of our bodies, backing up toward the bed. He clearly wanted to get a good look. I unfolded my arms and smirked at him. What else was I to do?</p>
<p>"Whaaat the fuuuck!" he roared. He shot a look over at Paul. "Dude!" he shouted. "You guys are fucking naked in our hotel room!" His eyes darted back over to me. They settled on my boobs. I saw him giving in to brief urges to check out my lady bits down below, too.</p>
<p>Lauren didn't seem to know what to do. She stared at us, then at the back of Conner's head, then at us again, her mouth still hanging open as if on the verge to either laugh or shout at us to leave.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden, Conner's eyes shot open. "Wait..." he mumbled. He spun his head around to look at Lauren who gave him a sheepish look. Then he swung it back in our direction, his expression full of disbelief.</p>
<p>"Hoooooly shit!" he exclaimed excitedly. He started to move about like he was standing on hot coals. "I know you fantasize about shit like this but I didn't think you'd ever actually go through with it!" Conner laughed, shooting Lauren another mystified look.</p>
<p>"Huh?" she said softly.</p>
<p>"This is fucking awesome!" Conner continued to laugh.</p>
<p>Then I realized what he was going on about. Having a threesome or a foursome wasn't exactly an unusual thing to fantasize about. Therefore, I wasn't necessarily surprised that Lauren had apparently had such a fantasy. I was, however, surprised that she had admitted it to Conner. And even more so that she never expressed that to me!</p>
<p>I almost burst out laughing all over again when I saw Conner suddenly scramble to get his shirt off and undo the belt on his pants.</p>
<p>"Whoa, uh-- uh," Lauren started to say, her face suddenly distorting into a comical expression of horror. I was briefly afraid she might have an aneurysm.</p>
<p>Conner undressed faster than I thought was humanly possible. I knew things were about to get real the moment he was down to his boxers. He gave me an eager look and grabbed hold of them, then dropped them straight to the floor and stood up proudly, searching expectantly for my approving gaze like I guess I expect any man would.</p>
<p>As far as Conner was concerned? He wasn't exactly my type. That said, he was more than sufficient eye candy. I had to laugh to myself when I saw Lauren's expression as his dick flopped out. I wondered if she thought I was comparing it to the impression she had once given me during one night of drinking when she let slip a little harmless gloating.</p>
<p>Conner raced back to bed, his supposedly expert appendage swaying about with increasing rigidity. He put his arms behind his head and stretched out, nude, with a big dopey grin on his cute face.</p>
<p>No one moved. I tried to say something but it turned into some kind of cross between a laugh and a hoarse choking on my own tongue.</p>
<p>"Come on in, the water's fine," Conner quipped while growing impatient. He lowered one hand to pat the bed with a smirk.</p>
<p>"Uh... actually..." Paul finally said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, um... well, hang on there..." I said, moving slowly toward Lauren's side of the bed. I sat on the edge of the mattress, trying to figure out how I could possibly save my friend from the shockingly presumptuous actions of her randy boyfriend. Paul followed right behind me, as if eager to hear what my explanation could possibly be at this point.</p>
<p>I shifted over onto the center of the bed to make room for him, letting him take my place in front of Lauren. I sat there cross-legged in front of an attentive crowd like some naked sadhu about to disseminate spiritual guidance. Only, instead, my presence there only served to draw attention to a pair of perky boobs jutting from my chest.</p>
<p>I was about to open my mouth to try, however in vain, to bring some sanity and understanding to the situation when Conner opened his own mouth first and made a rather consequential statement, even more so than the ludicrous request I had made to Paul earlier, which got us into that mess in the first place.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>He bolted upright, glancing toward Paul and then toward Lauren. "I wanna see you suck his cock," he said with an enthusiastic grin.</p>
<p>"Wha-" I sputtered, before launching into another coughing fit.</p>
<p>Conner could be a real prick sometimes. But he was a harmless prick. And a handsome one. Besides, he had been under the impression that this was something that his girlfriend had invited. I don't know why I didn't just explain the whole thing right then and there, detailing the nightmare I just went through and explaining that we were only there for help.</p>
<p>Perhaps I felt embarrassed for Lauren after what her boyfriend had just said. Perhaps it had already gone too far. Maybe I somehow knew that I wanted it to go further...</p>
<p>I saw Lauren's chest filling with air. The sheets about her body seemed to inflate at the same rate as her eyes which grew three times in size. "C-- Conner--" she wheezed.</p>
<p>He groaned. "Come on, Lauren. It's not like you don't want to. Shall I tell him? Or wait, did you tell him already?"</p>
<p>"Tell me what?" Paul asked. I could see Lauren's head about to explode. Her mouth did not make it open in time but it put in a good effort.</p>
<p>"I asked her once who she'd want to fuck if we ever had a threesome. Personally, I was hoping she'd say Amy but alas it was you." Conner chuckled to himself.</p>
<p>Steam was about ready to come out of Lauren's ears. She looked at Paul in horror, then at me, then back at Paul again, who seemed perfectly startled by the unexpected admission and had no words.</p>
<p>"So you got your wish. Let's see you do it," Conner laughed. I wondered how he could be so eager to see his girlfriend do that to another man but then I saw him inch his way closer to me...</p>
<p>I said nothing. Honestly, I was done trying to repair this situation. I was so ready to wash my hands of it. "Get yourself out of this," I imagined telling Lauren, ready to let someone else take over the futile attempt to detangle this fiasco. Deep down I knew that there would be no such thing as normal between the four of us anymore.</p>
<p>Heck, I knew a bombshell like this would never stay secret for long. Not amongst the friends that I had. We were gonna be talking about this for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>I rocked backward and crossed my arms, looking expectedly at Lauren, an amused expression returning to my face. It was a fake display of expectation. A joke. The way I usually act when I get anxious. How could I have known what she was going to do next?</p>
<p>Lauren stared at me wordlessly, shocked into a cocoon of perfect silence and bewilderment. However, to my surprise, she took a nervous swallow and seemed to soften her grip on the sheets she had been clenching the entire time. The moment she began to let them drop, I realized that I may have just inadvertently given her actual permission to share in my night of perfect fantasy with Paul.</p>
<p>The bedsheets dropped from Lauren's body and revealed her boobs. She flinched when she saw us look down at them. Lauren's pink nipples were noticeably puffy and flirting with Paul entirely of their own accord. I sat there in amazement as she slowly removed the sheets from the rest of her body. It occurred to me that I hadn't seen Lauren's body since the showers after gym class ages ago. I became weirdly fascinated that, in the time that had elapsed, she'd apparently taken to waxing her pubes into a perfect little landing strip.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe my eyes as Lauren crept forward toward Paul. He shot a look in my direction. I gave no reaction. Or rather, it remained unchanged from the look of mild amusement that had frozen onto my face and I had apparently forgotten to change. Turning back toward Lauren, he began to shift nervously. I glanced nervously downward. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised to see his snake being charmed by her advance.</p>
<p>Lauren crawled forward on her hands, seemingly self-conscious about the way her breasts swung beneath her chest as she approached his body. Paul seemed to be trembling. His legs slid open, at first cautiously, then abruptly widening. I could hear Lauren's breath growing heavy and strained as she made her way between his parted knees.</p>
<p>She gave me one more mute, cautious look as she reached out and took Paul's massive penis in her hand. It had reached full mast and I watched Lauren's fingers wrapping around his thick girth as she gazed down to study the way it pulsed and twitched in her hand.</p>
<p>Lauren closed her eyes and leaned inward, guiding him toward her opening mouth. As I watched her slowly swallow Paul's engorged cock I was surprised at how turned on it made me. I watched him sliding in and out, glistening and wet, coated in a thin film of my best friend's saliva and all I could think of is how equally wet I was, somewhere else.</p>
<p>Submitting to her, Paul eased backward and began to moan softly. Lauren started moving faster, breaking through a wall of uncertainty and exhibiting an emergent delight. I saw movement out of the corner of my eye. I glanced down and saw Conner seated next to me, his own cock sprouting from his lap like a flagpole. He was stroking it slowly, his eyes fixated on the urgent movements of his girlfriend.</p>
<p>I could feel my own hand trembling as I slipped it between my legs. Slowly, it began to steady itself as I started to gently circle my clit. I could smell myself becoming incredibly aroused. And if I could smell me, then surely Conner could. As he sat there stroking his dick, I caught a whiff of his own heady musk. It felt incredibly personal to be in their bed, to get a sense of the intimacy of his body, the one that Lauren knew so well and didn't expect to be sharing with me.</p>
<p>The sucking sound and the smacking of Lauren's lips are what really got me going. I felt my fingers becoming liquid as I watched the bobbing motion of her head and Paul's gorgeous member vanishing and reappearing before my eyes. I thought for sure I would feel jealous. But honestly? I didn't feel jealous at all. I felt weirdly proud. I remember thinking something like, "Amazing, right?! I was all over that shit just a little while ago." I almost made myself laugh out loud.</p>
<p>When Lauren finally pulled away, a little cord of saliva still clung to her lips as if they didn't want to let Paul go. She continued to hold his reddish, swollen member for a moment as she looked up at him. A deep exhale escaped her lips and I saw her chest collapse. It turned into a small laugh as the two of them shared a moment of intense realization over what just happened.</p>
<p>Lauren let go of Paul's cock and sat back, remaining there on her knees with her hands set squarely on her thighs. I chuckled when I saw that little quivering smile appear.</p>
<p>"That - was - fucking - awesome," Conner sang before clapping his hands slowly. Lauren gave a comical roll of her eyes, still tense and silently processing the situation. "Shall we see if two can play that game?" he added, grinning at me.</p>
<p>Conner laid back with his head on the fluffy pillow and his distended prick towering sharply from his lap. More than anything else, I was aroused by how wrong this whole thing was. And even more so now that I saw that all four of us were capable of going through with it together. So yeah. I did it. I crawled over to Conner, I grabbed his dick, and I went to town on it.</p>
<p>I sucked him slowly and firmly, then a little faster, letting my soft hair fall all over him and tickle his body. I heard him moaning in my ear, I felt his body seizing underneath me, and the erratic little jerks of his hips corresponding to sudden sparks of pleasure. For several minutes, I hungrily devoured him, thinking about what Lauren and Paul might be feeling seeing me do it. I worked at him until he was flustered, exasperated, leaking.</p>
<p>His cock popped free from my mouth and swung forward and back. I saw his glazed look and knew that we weren't done yet.</p>
<p>"Oh, you're gonna get it now," Conner laughed, apparently pleased with my skills. "How about we give the ladies a turn?" he asked Paul.</p>
<p>Paul exchanged a look with me, still wisely leaving every decision up to me. I silently signaled that it was fine. How funny that even at that point we were cautiously checking in with each other. I gladly took it to mean that, despite the temptation placed before him, Paul was still firmly committed to the unfinished task that had first removed us from the party.</p>
<p>Lauren and I laid back onto the pillows and sunk into a pair of soft indentations. Conner got between my legs and pressed my thighs apart. I could almost feel the wet humidity of my body begin to flourish as I expanded in front of his face. He reached out and ran his fingers back and forth over my outer labia, moistening his own fingers with my juices. I watched in wonder as he lifted those digits to his nose and then tasted me. I heard myself emit what sounded like a low growl.</p>
<p>Conner lowered between my legs and dragged the hard tip of his nose along the surface of my parting slit. I felt his warm tongue emerge to slide lazily over my silken flesh as he helped himself to the first taste of my pussy. I felt a shimmer spread throughout my body and suddenly felt like I'd sunken into the pillow deeper still.</p>
<p>He soon went to town on me like a parched nomad who had just crossed the desert. Paul, too, gave himself over to the enjoyment of Lauren's body, sucking sweetly at the sopping flesh of her lady bits. Admittedly, it was heaven. Oh god, I wanted to say things at that moment that I wasn't yet sure I could say aloud.</p>
<p>But it tried to come out anyway.</p>
<p>"Oh god-- yes..." I droned, "right there... fuck... yes, suck my clit..."</p>
<p>Conner grew feverish, his face now a beautiful mess. I couldn't imagine what Lauren's reaction was but I soon heard her whimpering and crying out. I saw her reaching to clutch at Paul's hair with jittery fingers.</p>
<p>When Conner finally came up for air, he declared, "Okay, are we gonna go tag team on this?"</p>
<p>I felt a mild hesitation when I saw Conner shift his body forward to align his hips with mine, grasping his throbbing manhood like it was the source of great suffering. Then I realized what his remark meant earlier, when he had left their room. They'd forgotten their condoms and couldn't find any downstairs. However, I found myself thinking about having my turn with Paul later and wanting an excuse to feel as close to him as possible.</p>
<p>The moment Conner entered me, he groaned, "Sweet baby Jesus..." What a poet he was. Such a way with words.</p>
<p>I felt like a hypocrite, observing the way he enjoyed my body with a certain whimsy. I mean, there I was looking at him like he were a set of cock and balls with some extraneous man attached. However, I reminded myself that we'd invited this. There was now some unspoken mutual permission to give into our primal urges in that space that we had carefully arranged for our own private enjoyment. I forgave myself for flicking the little angel off my left shoulder and patting the devil to my right.</p>
<p>The same attitude had taken hold of Paul and Lauren, too. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Paul's trembling body hovering over hers. I saw her meekly reach for his arm, grasping his bicep, her body arching suddenly as he reached down and began to insert his penis inside her.</p>
<p>As I felt Conner's steely erection fill the tight cavity of my body, I decided it would not be inappropriate to tease him with my own silly reaction. "Holy shit, Conner," I gasped dramatically, "That's a big fucking dick..." He lapped it right up like I knew he would.</p>
<p>Lauren, on the other hand, rotated her head and looked at me in horror.</p>
<p>"What? Apparently, this was all your idea. You even discussed it with Conner before!" I laughed. She gave me a stink eye but I knew she didn't really mean it. She even cracked a little smile. Besides, I knew her long enough to see the subtle signs that she was as turned on as I was.</p>
<p>Conner began to drive himself slowly back and forth through my depths as if on an exploratory mission to the core of the Earth. "Fuck I'm creamy," I thought to myself, astonished by the sight of his hard cock already slathered in a thick coating of my own indulgence. I began to gently grind against him, goading him on with increasing signs of my enjoyment until our bodies entered the rhythm of a full-on, lively hump. I saw a trickle of sweat on Conner's brow forming as he groaned and reached forward to clutch at my wobbling breasts.</p>
<p>I was surprised how quickly I'd taken to such an unabashed display of kinkiness. It felt like someone had just spoken to me in a language I'd never heard before and yet somehow I already knew the vocabulary by heart. Perhaps it was all the times I fantasized about things I thought I'd never experience; events such as this which were too prurient to ever actually suffer in the flesh as opposed to the mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I frankly couldn't believe Lauren got to fuck Paul before I did. Not that I was about to say anything but I'll admit I was intent upon watching firsthand what I was about to experience for myself. It was just a matter of time.</p>
<p>I wondered what she would think if she saw how she looked at that moment. A bit of her hair plastered across her face and stuck to her half-open, glossy lips. Her eyes gawking up at Paul's face. She blushed and exhibited the shock of being fucked mercilessly by another man next to her own boyfriend. I observed the subtle way she awkwardly humped back against his thrusts with a cautious longing.</p>
<p>I couldn't dwell on it for too long, as Conner soon wanted to flip me over. He had me pinned to the headboard, pressing my ass back against his body as his pelvis began to thunder against my cheeks. Conner was wild and I was fucking horny as hell to have him driving himself inside me. Ah, Lauren's hunky simpleton... For several minutes I sprang back and forth against the hard wall of his body, impaled on that hard cock of his, moaning first into the cascade of hair that fell over my face and then into the pillow that muffled my cries.</p>
<p>As good as it felt, I was still flustered by the knowledge that Paul and I would soon circle back to one another. When it happened, it was like we'd purposefully teased and tormented our partners with the sight of each other amorously engaged with another. Conner slipped back over the familiar landscape of Lauren's body with pure zeal, burying his face in her breasts as he worked his way up to her parted lips where she exhaled with a comfortable satisfaction. They intimately reconnected there.</p>
<p>I pulled Paul onto my body with such desperation and expectancy that he lurched against my breasts. I writhed beneath his warm, naked body as he suckled at my hardened nipples, enjoying the mutual sense that we shared; that we were both about to achieve all that we'd dreamed of together.</p>
<p>"That was fun-- but I missed you," he whispered, rising up to my lips. He tenderly tucked the hair behind my ears and gazed down at me.</p>
<p>"Welcome back," I cooed in his ear.</p>
<p>Conner lay Lauren down beside me and parted her legs. Paul rose up into the same position. I fished frantically for him, grasping his penis and guiding it between my legs. A soft plaint escaped my lips as I felt him smoothly enter me. My body expanded, welcoming him inside, squeezing him urgently with every muscle in my body.</p>
<p>It was nerve-wracking enough to be fucked mercilessly by an unquestionable hunk you've been pining after for years, but even more so when you've got one of your best friend's jostling tits swinging about in the corner of your eye. But there I was laying on my back gazing up at two fit, propulsive bodies treating us to a fuck that was nothing short of ethereal.</p>
<p>I felt dirty. It felt wrong. It felt wonderful.</p>
<p>I slid my arms up through my hair, over my head, climbing across the sheets until I grabbed and twisted them up into a ball in my hand. I felt like I was soaring. Paul's moans were music. I surrendered my breasts to him, they were his, bobbing gently in his hands as he cupped them. His eyes seared into my body, reflecting his intense longing, so potent that it seemed to unnerve him.</p>
<p>"Paul..." I moaned loudly, feeling my eyes tearing up.</p>
<p>"Oh god... Amy..." he grunted. I felt my well-lubricated body continue to acquiesce to him as he thrust with increased vigor.</p>
<p>As my head lolled dizzily back and forth, I caught sight of Conner lifting Lauren up into his arms. She settled there and immediately began riding him in his lap. I saw such fire ignite between them as she cupped his face and their eyes fiercely connected.</p>
<p>Watching them fuck was incredible. I thought, "Screw porn!" No matter how realistic some clever director could render smut, it couldn't possibly have anything on the experience of being right there. Hearing their every grunt and moan. Watching every subtle jerk and quiver. Even the heady funk of their sex perfumed the air; raw, earthy, like a pheromone or an exotic incense.</p>
<p>I was briefly as lost in their eyes as they were, observing how deeply and desperately Lauren gazed at Conner. How much aching and intense craving he expressed. As she urged her hips against his, I found myself watching messy, sloppy sex. Real sex. Not choreographed. Sex I could feel. Jerking bodies falling occasionally out of sync then quickly readjusting to one another in a manic effort to maximize pleasure.</p>
<p>The very act of watching his surging, upright cock penetrate her body seemed so full of taboo. It was an act I was not supposed to witness between them. A carnal act they were supposed to do in secret, not a performance for others. And yet there it was, exactly that.</p>
<p>Not only that, there were Paul and I putting on the same show for them.</p>
<p>I saw Conner take frequent looks at my recoiling breasts, my wet, seething pussy, with the same urgent arousal that he addressed his own girlfriend with. I saw the way Lauren snuck looks at us, observing us fuck, watching him fill my burning cunt with his swollen cock while I cried out in pleasure. And I don't even like that word! I've always found it degrading - and still do. Yet I'm almost ashamed to admit that there it was, pulsating in my mind, somehow inexplicably exciting. Like a dangerous new territory for my body. I wanted to usurp its power and turn it back against the world as I damn well pleased.</p>
<p>I guess that's the moment that I realized I'd gone fucking mad with lust. It was amazing how freely we two couples crossed borders between one another, without question, without any guilt or shame. Each of us fueling our own passions with the unbridled display of another's.</p>
<p>I felt myself growling as I pushed Paul backward and mounted him, ready for the spirited ride that I had imagined myself doing earlier. As I sunk down on his thick cock, I reveled in the way he filled and stretched me from the inside, his deep penetration threatening to reach my cervix. I anchored myself on his chest and locked eyes with him, wordlessly conveying to him who was in control now.</p>
<p>Paul's cock was thickly coated with my cum, easing in and out of my body as I generously anointed him with my emissions. I knew what he wanted. He wanted to see my long hair whipping about, my soaring tits, the feverish spring of my hips as I thundered up and down on his body. I gave him everything. And at the same time, I fed off of everything I could coax from him. His mad hunger, his desperate stare, his deep, guttural moans, his deep, plunging penetration.</p>
<p>"Baby-baby-baby-baby," Lauren dizzily rambled next to me, as if it were one long, braided word. I could almost hear the impending release on its way, rising through her body, bubbling up through her throat, unraveling her body on its way to unzipping her mind.</p>
<p>"Fuck! Baby! Yes... baby... baby -- ngh! Conner! Fuck me! Yeah, fuck me! Faster!" she screamed, her words disordered and voice raspy.</p>
<p>I'd never imagined hearing words like that coming out of her mouth. I wondered if this was their typical level of expression or if they were as driven to new heights as I was on account of our shocking "double date."</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"I'm coming!" she shrieked as her body began to convulse.</p>
<p>Lauren's nails gripped Conner's flesh and she seemed to vanish for a moment, their bodies tightening as if desperate to meld into one. Conner was sweating. His whole body seemed to be flush and pulsating. The vein of his forehead was straining wildly. I could smell their sex blooming heavily in the air, an intense display of arousal discharged at the height of their passion.</p>
<p>Paul and I felt ourselves suffering their explosion through the crisis we shared with them at that moment. Much the way you absorb the passion of a musician by dancing to their melodies, we were both audience and participants. He groped helplessly for my breasts while I scooped my hips back and forth, eager to take him home to the depths of me.</p>
<p>"Yes! Paul!" I laughed suddenly, sweeping my hands over his chest as I continued to bounce happily on his cock. "Oh fuck, I'm so wet... oh god, you make my pussy so wet!"</p>
<p>As if reacting to my own words, Conner suddenly gasped and gestured to Lauren. She flew off his body and kneeled before him as if in rapture, her breaths still strained and rapid. Conner began tugging his cock frantically rolling his head slowly forward and back like he was inebriated. He let fly a thick spurt that splashed across Lauren's breasts, then another and another as his hand slowed to a gentle pumping motion. I could see his balls tightening, his body in a fit of crisis as he emptied himself of all we had conjured together on that bed.</p>
<p>That was all I could take. With all the energy I had left in me, I drove Paul's cock through the recesses of my body with such abandon that all he could manage to do was slowly demonstrate his absolute inability to form words.</p>
<p>"Yes! Paul!" I gasped. "I'm gonna come so hard, baby-- please..." He grasped my hips and pounded his against mine until I threw my head back and screamed with pleasure. I felt the floodgates open, gushing wildly, dousing his body with an unbearable flood of my own juices. I came so hard that a warm puddle began to form on Lauren's bed.</p>
<p>Collapsing over his body and trembling as the final lashings of an earthquake rumbled through my body, I laughed to myself, "Good luck sleeping tonight." I imagined Lauren and Conner laying in bed later, overwhelmed with the lingering scent of my body soaked into the sheets all around them.</p>
<p>"Amy..." Paul croaked, his voice finally able to break free.</p>
<p>I climbed off him and threw myself between his legs. He was still sopping wet. I tasted myself on him. I tasted him mingled with me, as I began to suck him off. Admittedly, I don't always swallow. However, I wanted this badly. I wanted to feel him flood my mouth. I wanted to suck him dry. Every last drop.</p>
<p>And then he exploded in my mouth. A warm, slightly salty flood of passion and effort, ejecting from his body with reiterative spasms. I delighted myself on the deliciousness of his body, the pure luxury of his release until it dripped from my lips and chin as evidence of my fresh craving.</p>
<p>Paul let out a final groan and collapsed. We all did. We lay there, a sweaty, sticky heap on a shared bed, the sheets alternately matted and rumpled up into shambles all around us. For a little while, we all just stayed there, heaving, straining for breath, our minds finally acquiescing to what we'd become and how good it actually felt. Eventually, I saw Lauren's head pop up. I pushed myself up onto my elbows and saw her there watching me.</p>
<p>"Be right back, I gotta use the bathroom," she said. I knew that she wanted me to follow. We both got out of bed and hurried inside, then shut the door behind us. I wasn't quite sure what Lauren's reaction was going to be. I didn't even know what reaction was safe for me to have.</p>
<p>She walked halfway into the room, spun around, then eyed me incredulously. "What the fuck did we just do?!" she said, before tumbling into a fit of musical laughter.</p>
<p>I must have also had it bottled up inside me because I let loose in the same manner. When we finally purged all the emotion that was aching to pour out between us, I wiped the smile from my face and gave my best attempt at restoring absolute seriousness.</p>
<p>"You mean, you've really never done this before?" I deadpanned.</p>
<p>She froze, momentarily reconstituting the wild look of shock I had just grown so familiar with. I smirked and then stuck my tongue out at her and we burst out laughing again. At that moment, I felt so close to Lauren. Somehow closer than ever before, despite all the years we'd known each other and everything we'd gone through together. It was an incredible bond of trust, of sisterhood. I wanted to race over there and give her a hug but after the whirlwind of new experiences we'd just endured the last thing I needed was for Lauren to think I wanted her for an encore.</p>
<p>"Okay, I actually do have to pee," Lauren said, spinning back around and rushing toward the toilet. She threw the lid up, squatted down, and started peeing instantaneously. I quickly attended to her needs, dousing a few tissues with water and handing them over to help her clean off Conner's cum.</p>
<p>As she wiped her chest, I finally explained what had actually happened to Paul and I earlier. She stared at me in total disbelief. Then, with a finger flung through the air, she frantically started pointing at the door.</p>
<p>I turned and looked. A pair of robes hung on the back of the door; everything Paul and I needed to make a safe return to his own room. I pulled them down and thanked her. I waited for Lauren to finish wiping herself and wash her hands before we scrambled back to the door, excited to return to the guys.</p>
<p>Adorably, Paul and Conner looked like a pair of discarded playthings, strewn across the bed, their softening dicks falling limp to one side. Paul groaned as he rose to his feet and accepted the robe I offered him. A quick call to the front desk later and all was resolved. Paul and I strolled out into the hallway in the comfort of two white, billowy robes to have his room unlocked for us.</p>
<p>With the matter finally settled, we went inside and shut the door behind us. There was an odd sense of dj vu to it. Things had evolved so rapidly and unexpectedly that to find ourselves once again standing in front of his bed seemed somehow comical. So much had changed since we had the same encounter earlier that evening.</p>
<p>"Well, now what?" I laughed.</p>
<p>"I don't know!" said Paul, scratching the back of his head.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't mind a bubble bath. I can't remember the last time I stayed at a hotel that still had a tub."</p>
<p>"Room for one more?"</p>
<p>"You know it."</p>
<p>I casually approached his bed and cast off my robe. He came up alongside me and threw his on top of mine. Paul took my hand and we strolled naked together into the bathroom, still chuckling about the night we'd just had. Soon the warm water was rising, pushing a thick pile of bubbles up into the air. It looked like a snowdrift or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>
<p>Paul and I stepped inside, hugging each other close as we submerged our bodies into the hot liquid. His fading scent was still barely there. Vetiver maybe? I nestled myself into his lap. I felt his cock gently expanding between the cheeks of my ass, making its lengthening presence known. It excited me to see him still so aroused by my body. I teasingly rubbed against it with my slippery flesh and felt him smiling softly into my neck.</p>
<p>I sunk deeper into the bath, so perfectly relaxed that my mind sunk with me.</p>
<p>It drifted downward to muse about the strangeness of the human body. The wet mounds of my breasts peeked through the surface of the water like two sister islands with crimson peaks. Gentle waves of spume and sea foam lapped at their shores until Paul's hand rose from the depths of the ocean and devoured them with a tsunami of suds, washing away the little population of goosebumps that resided there.</p>
<p>I sunk even further, now wandering out through the mammoth old hotel around me. Like a phantom, I visited the rooms of Alexis, Rebecca, and Jacqueline, wondering if they were enjoying some alone time with their vibrators as I probably would be. I wondered if Lauren was lying in bed awake, staring up at the ceiling, her mind crowded with a million racing thoughts while Conner, tuckered out, snored peacefully beside her.</p>
<p>I wondered where Cassie and Mike were staying in the hotel, sharing their first night together as a married couple. Did their odyssey of lovemaking stretch so late into the evening that it greeted the same morning that now greeted me? Knowing Cassie, I wondered if they were already well on their way to making babies together.</p>
<p>It was a new day.</p>
<p>In just a matter of hours, I knew that a pink glow would emerge on the horizon and slowly breathe over Poughkeepsie. A city that so many of my old friends had said was changing. But the people around me were also changing. I was changing. This was my renaissance too. Together, Paul and I were opening up a whole new world, full of excitement and sexy new possibilities...</p>
<p>Anyway, you asked me what the most erotic thing I ever did was? That's a story still to be told, alas. But this is how it all started. What Paul and I did after that? Fuck, you might not believe me when I tell you. I mean, there was the time we--- Well. I'll tell you some other time.</p>
<p>That's a story for another day.</p>
