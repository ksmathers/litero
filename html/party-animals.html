<p>5:58pm and Marcus stared intently at the door. Marcus had always been the "party guy", even decades after he had left Harvard, his contacts and legal profession still were dominated by his reputation as the organiser of the wildest parties on campus.</p>
<p>So yet again he found himself in charge of the latest charity event, a fundraiser for a legal aid charity called TransLegal. Though the charity didn't matter, it was just the justification for having a party that wasn't about a single person. But this party had one difference, Marcus had been going through a lot recently, and had decided to use this party to reclaim his old mantle.</p>
<p>The problem was that despite his reputation, nobody giving Marcus the money and power to put events together actually wanted the kind of parties Marcus organised at college and specialised in. Law offices were dominated by old middle class men who were more into brandy by a fireplace than drug filled rager that ended when the police turned up. Marcus was considered the best party organiser working in the legal profession, but was not allowed to organise the kind of parties that got him that reputation. As he grew older, his life grew quieter, and his parties grew tamer. From all angles in his life, he began to feel like a caged tiger and wanted release.</p>
<p>For this party, Marcus had forsworn the usual five star hotels and expensive event spaces in favour of a modern mansion that had been converted to a party venue by its owner while he dealt with the financial ramifications of his divorce. Nestled in the foothills outside the city where the rich build large and private spaces to do with as they wished, it was ready for Marcus' plans. It had bars dotting the indoor and outdoor spaces, a kitchen large enough for caterers to operate in, a pool and jacuzzi, a far reaching integrated speaker system, a small gazebo in the garden that could double as a stage for entertainment, and even a table tennis table with beer pong supplies on standby.</p>
<p>But then there were the added touches Marcus had included to recapture the college party atmosphere that had forged his reputation. Instead of some posh black tie caterer, he had struck a deal with a café whose unique selling point was that their servers only wore bikinis. He couldn't wait to see the old men reaching for their heart medication as food and drink was handed out by scantily clad women.</p>
<p>Marcus had also hooked up every immature idea he had ever had while idly thinking about the ultimate party when he was at college. Naturally he had set aside rooms for those who wanted to do drugs, hidden away with contingency plans in case someone called the police. He had filled a paddling pool with jelly, lots of decks of cards for strip poker, and a series of twister mats flanked on all sides with sundae bars. At every turn he had planted drinking games and forfeit games that he knew could make memories even in those too intoxicated to remember any other point of the night. He had even figured out how to rent billiards and foosball tables and cleared space so some friendly competition would get drinks flowing and raise spirits.</p>
<p>So now he stood by the front door, nervously checking his phone and the time, tonight he was going to piss off a lot of people, but he would get back the swagger worn away by a million small acts of enforced maturity. Those who survived would be in no doubt what they should expect from now on if they wanted a party organised by Marcus Selassie.</p>
<p>It was exactly 6:00pm, the official start time for the party, and Marcus stared in horror as a taxi approached the house. Someone was going to be on time! Out of the taxi stepped a stuffy middle aged man in a regulation tuxedo, his hair straight from a catalogue and his face looking the right mix of disapproving and uncomfortable that was a death knell for a good party atmosphere.</p>
<p>"What kind of guber turns up to this sort of party on time?" Marcus mumbled to himself.</p>
<p>How Barnaby Watford ended up at the party</p>
<p>"Do I have to go?" I asked petulantly.</p>
<p>"You don't have to, but it will be great for your career." My boss replied.</p>
<p>This was exactly the kind of situation I became a lawyer to avoid. So many people saw lawyers as they were on TV, charismatic and suave, giving big speeches and shocking reveals, people who went into law to be like that didn't last their first year out of law school. I saw being a lawyer as a profession where hard work and diligence could win over that annoyingly effortless charm through which the charismatically stupid flirted their way through life.</p>
<p>I loved the late nights preparing briefs, the structures, the lack of surprises, my life was a cavalcade of being so well prepared the other side settled or backed down before I was ever called upon to do public speaking. But then I got promoted to a level where all talk turned to where I would be going for a partnership.</p>
<p>Partnership is another thing that doesn't happen like in the movies, but this time in a bad way. In movies the hero works hard and when he is judged to be the best lawyer he is promoted to partner. In the real world, when a lawyer has saved up enough money to give a huge chunk of it to a group of old men he's networked to death, then he can become partner.</p>
<p>So an invite to a big fancy party where several members of partnership boards would be swanning around is something all logic is telling me is a good thing, and yet it feels to me like swimming back into the social waters I often drowned in at high school. Making partner would solve all my problems, so I was determined to see this through no matter how uncomfortable it was.</p>
<p>My wife and I have a relationship that nobody seems to understand but us. Many wondered why an intelligent woman such as Matilda would want to be a housewife, but she describes herself as a "lady of leisure", able to indulge a smorgasbord of hobbies and academic pursuits at any time. I'm still single minded enough that I can get passionate about any angle of the legal system I need to call upon, but she needs a constant rotation of new engagements to hold her attention. Until now our passions simply matched in their intensity and intelligence. She would listen to me talk for hours on end about obscure legal precedents, and in turn I would listen to her wax lyrical about the effects of welding different metals, or megalithic stoneworks on Tongan islands.</p>
<p>Lately I have started to see Matilda's interest in our marriage fading and I'm worried that I may soon become yet another passing hobby for her. It wasn't unusual for her to be gone for a semester at another college or a research trip, but we at least kept in regular touch. Her most recent distraction is a sociology course at a community college just beyond an easy commute so necessitating another bout of dorm life for her. This one is different though, recently she hardly ever answers my calls and when I can get through she would talk about all the great lessons she was learning, however I was never privy to what those lessons were.</p>
<p>So I decided that becoming a partner is the key to the higher pay and shorter working hours necessary for me to start joining her on her interests, travel with her, learn with her, actually start really sharing our lives. Matilda has put up with my monoculture long enough and I was determined to do whatever it took to shake things up, even if it meant my worst nightmare, social interaction.</p>
<p>I dressed myself in a nice tuxedo, posh enough to show I had money to invest in my clothes but not fashionable enough to show I wanted to draw attention to myself. I took a deep breath and stepped into a taxi for a long night of ass kissing.</p>
<p>"Barnaby Watford, pleased to meet you. I'm sorry, am I early?" Barnaby asked, stepping into the house as Marcus pressed a Champagne glass into his hand. "The invite said 6pm."</p>
<p>"Marcus Selassie." Marcus stated by way of introduction as he fought through Barnaby's formal handshake. "You are bang on time, it's just the rest who are late."</p>
<p>"How unprofessional of them." Barnaby quipped. Marcus bristled, this man was to be his nemesis, Marcus knew that this man storming out would be the bare minimum to consider this party a success.</p>
<p>"Speaking of unprofessional, would you like an appetiser?" Marcus asked, waving over a server he spotted in passing.</p>
<p>"Why not, I'm sure I could... good lord!" Barnaby interrupted himself as a young lady in a skimpy gold bikini held a tray of spring rolls out for him.</p>
<p>"What do you think?" Marcus asked, drinking in the abject shock on Barnaby's face. "Some very attractive girls putting themselves through college will be our serving staff tonight, if that doesn't kick off the party on the right foot I don't know what will."</p>
<p>"Well, yes, of course." Barnaby stuttered, unable to keep his head from turning as the server walked away.</p>
<p>"You're not uncomfortable are you?" Marcus gloated, trying not to sound too vicious.</p>
<p>"Bit of a shock but it's not too outrageous for me." Barnaby lied. "Just makes you wonder what kind of woman would sign up to do that."</p>
<p>How Matilda Watford ended up at the party</p>
<p>"Do I have to go?" I asked petulantly.</p>
<p>"Afraid it's all hands on deck." My boss replied. "But at least there's a nice payday in it for you."</p>
<p>Payday? Two months ago the thought of caring about a paycheque would have brought a bitter laugh to my lips, but now it was all I could think about.</p>
<p>I called myself a lady of leisure, my husband pulling in enough money from his job as a lawyer that I could become a true cosmopolitan, moving from one interest to the next and fulfilling my every whim for development.</p>
<p>Every so often I would do another short course at one university or another, meeting new people and excelling at a new discipline. But the one that spun me off into this new direction was a sociology course I took at a community college of all places. I'll admit community college was always an act of vanity for me, I know it's snobbish but it was always assumed I would be top of the class in any course taken at the far less prestigious institutions, and it was no different when I started studying one of the humanities at Rindlebrook Community College.</p>
<p>In that class I built up a rivalry of sorts with a young lady called Mercedes. Our seminars always seemed to descend into debate between the two of us while the rest of the class would watch in awe. My breadth of knowledge seemed to clash hard against her deep and intuitive understanding of Marxist and neo-Hegelian analysis. I always left our discussions feeling invigorated but she would sometimes take it incredibly personally and be less gracious than I.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the first round of class grades were posted that my ego took a hit. For the first time in a long time I was in line for salutatorian, second place, silver medal. What's worse was not Mercedes' position as valedictorian, I knew if I was coming second she must have pipped me at the post, but it was the sheer gulf between our grades. She was as far ahead of me as I was the rest of the class. As luck would have it we were assigned as groupwork partners, so I had a chance to buy her a coffee at the campus café and ask her what her secret was.</p>
<p>"How willing are you to be personally insulted by my answer?" Was Mercedes candid reply.</p>
<p>"I'll take it in good spirit." I responded, bracing myself.</p>
<p>"It's because you are the very picture of privilege and infra-political class dialectics. You have come to learn sociology like society is a butterfly in a frame for you to investigate. My dad is in prison for an amount of weed that the police wouldn't have even inconvenienced a white person over, with an additional charge of resisting arrest because he screamed swear words as they beat his ass. My mum is a manager at a bikini cafe that my sister worked at right up until she was knocked up and had to quit. I was meant to be going to UCLA until a teacher took a bribe to give me a behavioural suspension so my scholarship would pass to a rich kid whose dad wanted to save a few bucks. When I read about society in books, I see people putting into words what I have been suffering from all my life. So now I'm at a community college, working my ass off for a piece of paper that says I'm smart enough to be worth the effort a rich person has to go through to pay me what I'm worth."</p>
<p>I sat stunned for a while.</p>
<p>"You didn't actually insult me that much." I noticed, trying to lighten the tone.</p>
<p>"If you think that, you didn't see the point." Mercedes spat. "You're vacationing in lives you are indirectly responsible for making harder than you could ever endure. The issues we study are structural, and when the scales tip, you are on the side it was in favour of. How many other people in that class do you think have no other pulls on their time like you? I work as a bartender, get a bit of extra cash looking after my niece, and pull any odd jobs I can so I don't end up in a bikini in my mum's cafe. Everyone else in that class is working, has caring duties, has any of a number of distractions that you have paid to get around. You have a free run at every piece of work we are assigned and you are still bitching that you're only second place."</p>
<p>I felt a wave of guilt and anger well up within me, I wanted to snap back and tell her she was wrong, but my open mind betrayed me. It was hard to hear but I accepted she was right.</p>
<p>"I joined that class for the same reason I do anything, to broaden my horizons." I stammered, "I never realised how much I was missing."</p>
<p>"And what you're missing can't be learned in a book, you have to live it, but I don't see you doing that." Mercedes scoffed.</p>
<p>"You may not see it, but I will."</p>
<p>I made my plan, I would work for my living, I wouldn't spend a penny I didn't earn myself until I had finished my sociology course. I moved out of my dorms into a cheap apartment and I found the worst job I could stomach. I signed on with a cleaning agency, working 40 flexible and unusual hours a week to earn enough to rent a shared apartment and pay for cheap food.</p>
<p>In the first week something became quickly apparent to me, I was not good at cleaning. I figured that with my wide breadth of knowledge I could handle "unskilled labour" but a good thorough clean that was expected from paid cleaners seemed to elude me. It must have made its way up to my supervisor as I soon found myself facing the worst jobs.</p>
<p>It was the worst experience of my life, the education I needed, working my ass off cleaning up disgusting things, then going back to my tiny apartment and eating ramen noodles and worrying about my bills. Naturally my grades began to slip, not enough to cost me my salutatorian status, but enough to make me far less distinguished. Money worries were a constant feature of my life, but I was determined to see it through.</p>
<p>Mercedes had recommended cleaning work when I went through my plans with her, and had told me about the agency I signed on with because they cleaned her mother's café. So it was no surprise when I ended up being sent there for another bottom of the barrel job for cleaners who earned the ire of their manager, to clean the dried semen often found in the toilets and once or twice in the main café. I saw pictures on the walls of the waitresses in skimpy gold bikinis, and instead of my usual wave of judgement, I felt sympathy, they too were trying to make ends meet however they could.</p>
<p>The cafe was open late so cleaning usually took place in the morning before it opened, which is why one morning I was able to witness the spectacle of Mercedes' mother, a statuesque picture of strength called Meagan, storm in channelling all her fury into a text message. She wiped her brow, looked around, then locked eyes with me.</p>
<p>"Cleaning lady, how would you like to make 200 bucks plus tips for 12 hours work?" She yelled. I marvelled at the prospect of getting an amount of money I wouldn't have stopped in the street to pick up a month ago. $200 was a week's wages and she wanted to give me it for a day. "I've had both of my servers drop out on me, so it'll be hard work, but if you put on a bikini and take some orders, I'll get you your money."</p>
<p>I froze. She wanted me in a bikini, debasing myself for $200. The figure meant a lot more these days, but I had a remaining sense of dignity that was linked to my former life where $200 barely covered some of my outfits, I needed some time to think, but apparently that was also a luxury I was no longer permitted access to.</p>
<p>"Come on blondie, yes or no" Meagan asked expectantly.</p>
<p>"Yes, OK." I nervously responded.</p>
<p>"Thanks, no time to lose, let's get you sorted with a uniform." She immediately replied, grabbing my hand and dragging me into the staffroom, leaving my mop and bucket forgotten in the corner. "What bra size are you?"</p>
<p>"34C" I reactively responded, the bluntness of the question asked out of the blue lowering my defences.</p>
<p>"Yeah we got that." She replied, pulling a gold two piece bikini out of a draw and thrusting it at me. "Changing room is next to the bathroom."</p>
<p>I looked at myself in the mirror, adorned with this gold monstrosity and saw a steady cumulation of the physical manifestation of the changes I had been going through. I simply hadn't had time to notice my body changing through a poverty diet and constant physical exertion. I was leaner and more muscley, but at the same time my skin glowed less and my blonde hair was more greasy and unmanaged, with brown roots beginning to show through where hair bleaching had been a luxury discarded early in my journey.</p>
<p>I nervously left the changing room and my new boss was already waiting for me with a can of something she was in no mood to pre-explain, instead opting to order me around.</p>
<p>"Turn around." She ordered. I obeyed and felt my bikini briefs being lifted up and something sticky being sprayed underneath. "Body adhesive, lets us give you panties that are not quite a thong but still showing off most of the butt. Trust me, this is the most exposure our licence will let us get away with so if you feel your panties retreating into your crack come back here for another spray. If you are of the bouncy persuasion you may also want to use this on your bust as we are not licensed for you popping out."</p>
<p>I thought for a moment and then held out my hand for the can of spray glue, I didn't know what to expect but I might as well protect myself. I gritted my teeth as I covered my breasts with the sticky substance and felt a mixture of dirty and protected.</p>
<p>"Here's your pad and pen, write the orders clearly enough for the kitchen staff to read. If a man gets handsy with you, tell him to leave, if he doesn't, come back here and we'll keep you safe while I call our security network to come from neighbouring Timberwood and remove him. We used to have in-house security but the bosses figured being part of a network based half a mile away was cheaper."</p>
<p>"What about shoes?" I interrupted.</p>
<p>"Oh god you can't do this job barefoot." Meagan exclaimed, only just noticing my shed footwear from my time dressing myself in a fugue state. "Just put your old shoes back on, the uniform used to be high heels until we started sending photos of our blisters to headquarters every week and now they let us wear whatever shoes we're comfortable in."</p>
<p>It had been 15 minutes since I had been mopping the floor, and in a blur of activity where I had found myself a spectator to my own life I now stood in an empty cafe wearing nothing but a skimpy bikini and my sneakers, awaiting the arrival of customers. I placed my hands at my sides and shuddered at the feeling of my bare arm skin pressing against my mostly bare torso. I found it awkward standing still doing nothing so I put my efforts into putting away my cleaning supplies. By the time I was done my boss was beckoning me over to the door where she had the key in the lock and a queue of customers already forming.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>I gasped as their eyes turned to me. It had been a bit daunting being in a bikini but, up until now, no worse than leaving the changing room for a swimming pool. However now I found myself face to face with a group of hungry men staring at me with unconcealed lust, the self-consciousness hit me like a wave of lava.</p>
<p>"Table for four please." A brash young man barked at me as he barged his way in. I led the way to a corner table that made sense to me, aware that they were probably all staring at my ass the whole time. I took their drinks orders, passed them to Meagan who was behind the counter with the drinks and cakes before going back to the entrance to guide more people to their seats.</p>
<p>As more and more people began to fill the café, I expected to become more familiar with my state of undress, but the lingering looks and cut short conversations made me more self-conscious with every new customer seated. It wasn't until I overheard the phrase "... those nipples" in a passing conversation, I looked down and saw my nipples practically leaping off my bust, two unmistakable golden bulges imposing themselves on the cheap stretchy gold fabric.</p>
<p>Beneath my cool outer exterior I had a very self-contained panic attack. All the eyes on me began to burrow through what meagre scraps of fabric were protecting my dignity. I pictured my friends coming in and laughing at my humiliation, my husband shocked at seeing his proper and accomplished wife reduced to showing off her body for 12 hours, just to earn an amount of money that was less than half what he made in an 8 hour day, the rumour mill of my old life running into overdrive passing news of my fall from grace to every social circle I had ever even brushed up against.</p>
<p>"Can you fit in eight?" A customer asked from the doorway, cutting through my panic.</p>
<p>"Err... sure, I could push those two tables together." I replied, happy to have a purpose.</p>
<p>What followed was a strange revelation. After weeks of struggling and feeling not good enough at basic cleaning, I felt pride again as I was actually really good at waiting tables. I had a knack for keeping things orderly in my mind. The constant awareness of who needed seating, who was waiting for food and drink, who hadn't had attention in a while, it was a strain but I was able to hold it all in my mind as I operated. Once I got my eye in, I could be proud that I was running the whole café like a pro.</p>
<p>My nipples never stopped standing on end however.</p>
<p>By the end of the night, my boss had a satisfied look on her face as she locked up</p>
<p>"You're a natural, ever think of ditching the cleaning job and coming to work here?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Oh no, I couldn't." I replied, my breathing quickening at the thought of this afternoon becoming my life.</p>
<p>"Alright, we are hiring so if you change your mind you know where to find us. Although don't expect $200 every time, that was an emergency rate. Plus you'd usually be sharing the tips with another waitress so don't expect this much." She handed me a cheque that in the past I wouldn't have even made the effort to cash, but now it made my eyes bulge out of my skull.</p>
<p>I felt good all afternoon, wondering to myself if I should take her up on the offer, but as with a lot of facets of my new life, the decision was quickly taken out of my hand when the next day my cleaning boss gave me a letter of termination. He'd always wanted to get rid of me, but when I pulled a shift at the café he found his opening, calling it a violation of my non-compete clause. Worse still my last paycheque was decimated by every dubious trick in the book. Over half of my hours were classified as unauthorised overtime without pay, 'excess product use' and uniform costs were deducted, and barely any was left for me to live on. I knew this was illegal, but my former employer knew to pursue it would cost money up front that I didn't have.</p>
<p>Within the week, I had a golden bikini of my own, and a work schedule at the café.</p>
<p>"We have a private catering gig." Meagan explained, "good money and big tips, but in my experience more handsy and inappropriate. But the pay is good enough that it will give you some breathing room for those finals I know you have coming up."</p>
<p>"Do I have to go?" I asked petulantly.</p>
<p>Matilda cowered behind the door staring in shock at her husband standing in the hallway. She was already in her gold bikini, her tray of gazpacho in shot glasses rattling with her nerves.</p>
<p>'Fuck' she thought to herself. 'What's he doing here? And more importantly what am I going to do about it?'</p>
<p>Hey Matilda, why are you..." her boss began, looking only slightly less intimidating in a gold bikini of her own.</p>
<p>"Shhh." Matilda shushed, putting her hand over her boss's mouth and realising from her wide eyes she owed her a quick explanation. "Sorry, but that guy in the hallway is my... ex-husband."</p>
<p>Matilda felt bad for Barnaby's new reduced status, but she remembered how Mercedes had felt about her taking a holiday in the lives of the working class. She didn't want her co-workers to learn that she was married to a man who could buy her out of this life without a second thought.</p>
<p>"...and I'm guessing it would be a problem if he found out about your new job?" Her boss asked with a deep and genuine compassion, taking her answer from the deep and paralysing fear across Matilda's face. "How about we sneak you out of the back? We can handle things."</p>
<p>"No." Squeaked Matilda. "I need this paycheque. Could I just hide out until he leaves? This isn't his kind of party anyway."</p>
<p>"Help out in the kitchen until the party gets a bit busier, then I'll see where he is and assign you far away. People don't tend to look at our faces anyway." Her boss asserted, taking the tray of gazpacho out of her hands.</p>
<p>Matilda was so grateful, and she kept herself busy in the kitchen as best as possible, but she felt guilty the whole time. Gradually more and more people were filling up the party for the other waitresses to deal with, and it wasn't like someone wearing nothing but a bikini was safe and sanitary in a cooking environment.</p>
<p>Eventually Matilda's frustration got the better of her and she peered around the door. The party was starting to fill out, and Marcus was doing a great job getting drinks flowing and everyone in the mood to make bad decisions.</p>
<p>"Have we got another tray of entrées?" A petite woman in a gold bikini asked Matilda.</p>
<p>"Hang on, you're not one of us. Who are you and why are you wearing a gold bikini?"</p>
<p>How Gwen McDonald ended up at the party</p>
<p>"Can I go?" I asked petulantly.</p>
<p>"Ticket price is 3 figures, and I see how much you make." My boss replied. She wasn't forbidding me, she knew she couldn't, but it was clear she didn't want me there.</p>
<p>"Wanna bet?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No." She bluntly refused.</p>
<p>I never had a career plan so to speak, I just had a knack for getting what I needed as long as I was in the presence of those who had it. My official job role at Blackmore &amp; Jones was administrative assistant, my actual job was a mix of fixer and con artist, with occasional afternoons making Excel spreadsheets that did my official job for me.</p>
<p>The trick I learned early on was in the rush of everyone trying to prove themselves, all those egos, the machismo of men, the feminine wiles or resentful machismo of their own in women, everyone took any opportunity to get ahead. That made people predictable, which made them putty in my hands. I was a petite, 24 year old girl with pixie cut pink hair, working in an underling position. Everyone thought they could stamp their authority on me and I made sure it never worked out.</p>
<p>I got the job off a bet, I happened to know the guy at the recruitment firm Blackmore &amp; Jones uses and he rigged the selection process after I downed my pint quicker than him. I bet my boss that I could throw a balled up piece of paper in the bin from across the office and got moved to a desk surrounded by the most important people. Then it was a matter of listening and waiting for my opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>There were always two features of my bets: firstly I never made a bet I couldn't win, most of the time you could take people down with downing drinks or a feat of hand eye coordination, things I had relentlessly practised for some time. Secondly, my end of the bet, the consequences of losing, was always an act of sexual humiliation.</p>
<p>At first it was just an angle to make sure the bets happen. Everyone I bet with had more than me, so when they asked what my stake was I would always tell them something that stoked their desire to see me taken down a peg. Over time it became a calling card, an inevitability, something as integral to the bet as the complete confidence that I wouldn't have to do it.</p>
<p>If I had downed my drink slower, the recruitment manager would have gotten to watch me buy the next round topless. If I had missed the bin my boss would have won a freshly prepared photocopy of my tits.</p>
<p>Recently I had decided that I wanted to go to one of these charity galas. Everyone kept talking about the show of opulent wealth and I knew if I could get my foot in the door I could get myself a piece of that. People around the office are a bit put off betting against me, especially not for wads of cash, so I had to bide my time and find the right person to win either a ticket, or enough money to buy a ticket.</p>
<p>"Did you say you wanted a ticket to the TransLegal fundraiser?" A polished female voice emanated from behind the door of a private office. "Because I have one to gamble with."</p>
<p>Claire Blackmore, partner of the firm, was looking directly at me with a cheeky grin across her face.</p>
<p>"Come in, let's discuss terms." She beckoned, opening the door and letting me into her large, opulent office. I sat in a chair worth more than my annual salary and sat patiently as Claire composed herself. "Yesterday, during a heated discussion with my partner, he suggested he would rather you co-ran this place than me. I know it was mostly in jest but I still feel the need to take you down a peg. I know of your propensity to win bets, I would like to be the first in the office to triumph over you."</p>
<p>"So you think you can throw a piece of paper into a bin from further away than me?" I goaded, to which she barely reacted.</p>
<p>"I haven't had a look at your job description recently, but I doubt throwing a piece of paper into a bin is on there. No, I want to take you down at your job. If you remember from your induction, there is a series of training sessions and tests on Microsoft Excel. I'll let you pick a test, and if you can complete it faster than me, you get my ticket to the party." Claire explained.</p>
<p>"Alright, and if I win..." I began.</p>
<p>"You are not dictating terms here." Claire interrupted. "But I confess I have heard of your bets and your stakes and I am intrigued to continue the pattern I have noticed. If you lose, tomorrow you do your job without any clothes."</p>
<p>I chuckled but Claire quickly made it obvious that she was entirely serious. I tried to find the angle or trick but there wasn't one. She would know that I had completed the Excel training module already, even if she had also done it that would make us level pegging and she spent a lot less of her life on Excel than me. I took a deep breath and decided to call her on it.</p>
<p>'It can't be that easy', I thought to myself as I walked into Claire's office to inform her I had completed test number 3. Indeed she agreed I had won the bet without a fuss and handed over the ticket.</p>
<p>"Double or nothing?" She calmly asked, "I confess I was hoping you wouldn't pick pivot tables."</p>
<p>"You better make the stakes good if you want a do-over." I pushed.</p>
<p>"How about I acknowledge the ticket is yours, and if I win you simply do me a favour I was hoping to do myself at the party. If I lose, I will be the one going to work tomorrow without a stitch of clothing on me."</p>
<p>The infamous Claire Blackmore, walking naked into the office, and when everyone asks why, I get to tell them I beat her in a bet. The appeal was far too tempting to say no to, I agreed and chose one of the hardest tests on the course before heading back to my desk.</p>
<p>My mind was a blur, I focussed and poured my heart and soul into ensuring I would be the one embarrassing the partner tomorrow. I was halfway through question 2 when I received an email from Claire, subject line: "done!"</p>
<p>"How did you..." I began, Claire carelessly held up her hand and turned her screen around to show me her screen with the completed exercise.</p>
<p>"You are not in charge of this office, I am." She calmly stated. "But I noticed your talent at manipulation and figured I would play some old games, re-live the nostalgia of conning my way through life like you. I could have simply given you this ticket with my instructions but I hope you agree this was more fun."</p>
<p>I was in awe of Claire, chuckling to herself at the execution of a plan that could have gone so wrong for her.</p>
<p>"These parties are different things to different people, to those with 'enough' it is simply an opportunity to have fun, but to those who want more, they are an intricate game of social chess. I assume you would have been working some sort of angle, all I now ask is that you work those angles for us. Some will be there looking for a good law firm, as you lost the bet I expect one such partnership to come home with you. Good luck." She chirped.</p>
<p>"And what if I don't come back with a firm in tow?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Then we'd have to revert to your original forfeit, wouldn't we?" She giggled, directing me out of the room, satisfied at her afternoon hijinks.</p>
<p>Gwen had arrived at the party a casual 15 minutes fashionably late, it was still sparse but she was at least able to get the lay of the land. The host told her of all the fun activities he had laid out for guests and Gwen saw so many opportunities for party games that could end in bets. She had a brief conversation with Barnaby but when it became clear he was there looking for bigwigs to suck up to, Gwen moved on.</p>
<p>In the end Gwen decided to hang out by the billiards table, she had always wondered about practising billiards to get good enough to add it to her hustling rota, but for now it would have to do as something to spur on people's competitive urges. Gwen was at least grateful for the tacky but exciting bikini servers traversing the length and breadth of the party, certainly she saw a few potential marks who had been graciously pre-horned up for her.</p>
<p>It's why she was so shocked when after about half an hour on the billiards table, making some minor bets on fetching drinks and downing shots, that it was a woman in a scandalous and undoubtedly expensive red dress, immaculate hair and nails, and dazzling jewellery, that emerged from the ether to push the bets into overdrive.</p>
<p>"I had to come over here to see who had all these men bending over backwards to serve her." She announced.</p>
<p>"Just someone with some skill. Maybe you want to be next to get me a drink?" Gwen goaded, she could see this person was worth her attention.</p>
<p>"I'm still finishing my glass of wine, how about a tray of entrées?" She suggested.</p>
<p>"In case you haven't noticed, there's some women in skimpy bikinis bringing the food around..." Gwen began, looking to turn things deviant, not expecting the woman in red to beat her to it.</p>
<p>"... And don't you think one of them deserves a break?" She asked through a smirk, calling over one of the servers. "What's your drink for downing?"</p>
<p>"How about a pint of cider?" Gwen suggested.</p>
<p>"OK then. Bring us two pints of cider and two shots of tequila. Then hang around a moment, whichever of us downs our drink slowest will swap clothes with you and serve the guests for half an hour." The woman in red ordered.</p>
<p>"I don't know..." the server began.</p>
<p>"You won't get in trouble and there will even be a big tip in it for you." She reassured, sending the server off to pick up the drinks while Gwen and her talked terms in front of a growing crowd of men.</p>
<p>"Both drinks down the throat, they are done when both glasses are empty and upside down on the table and the drinker's mouth is open to demonstrate it's all gone down." Gwen stated.</p>
<p>"Of course, no interfering with the other drinker, no touching them or their glasses, or calling on anyone else to do similar." She stated.</p>
<p>"Seems fair." Gwen agreed, wondering what such an elegant lady was doing entering a drinking contest, and why she thought she could win it. The server returned and placed the drinks in front of the contestants. "Ready?"</p>
<p>"I still haven't finished my wine." The woman in red protested. Certainly she had been nursing from her large bulbous burgundy glass the whole time, but Gwen thought that had been about intimidation. "Let me finish, then the moment this wine glass touches the table, the contest begins, OK?"</p>
<p>Gwen smirked, she was nervous and delaying the inevitable. However Gwen's smirk faded when the woman in red finished her wine, turned the glass upside down, then placed it neatly over Gwen's shot glass.</p>
<p>"I haven't touched your glass, and you're not allowed to touch mine." The woman in red calmly reminded before beginning to drink her cider at a leisurely pace, leaving Gwen to stare in horror at the realisation that for the first time she was the one that had been tricked into losing the bet. She simply stood in stunned silence as the woman in red finished her drinks and drank in the applause of the crowd.</p>
<p>"Now then waitress. Here is $100 to compensate you for the effort of escorting this young lady to the bathroom where you will swap clothes. Then just have fun at the party, in half an hour we'll come find you to change back." The women in red explained, handing the server a handful of $20 bills and pointing them to the nearest toilet.</p>
<p>The toilets were not the kind found in venues, with cubicles and space for privacy, instead it was a standard household toilet with nowhere to hide, so Gwen agreed to dress back to back with the server, picking the golden bikini off the floor without daring to turn around to see the woman's naked body, or worse, to see if the server had turned around to see hers.</p>
<p>The bikini did not fit well and they had to drastically shorten the straps to keep the bikini tight over Gwen's petite frame. As well as this they realised they had different shoe sizes, so opted not to swap footwear, leaving Gwen in a gold bikini with 6 inch high heels, and the server in a formal dress and comfortable flats. Gwen was about to ask for a moment to compose herself when the server, without any fanfare, stepped out and began to mingle with the crowd.</p>
<p>There was a cheer from the billiards table as Gwen sheepishly returned in the cheap gold bikini. Strangely enough the woman in red was no longer there, which if anything was worse. No gloating, no taking in her victory, she had simply triumphed over Gwen and not given it another thought.</p>
<p>She took a shot glass out of a stranger's hands and downed it, then she picked up the tray and turned around to go fetch some entrées from the kitchen and was treated to another cheer. Unlike the other waitresses, Gwen didn't have the body adhesive necessary to keep the bikini bottoms from riding up, so those gathered by the billiards table were treated to Gwen's basically unobscured butt.</p>
<p>The shameful humiliation of her situation churned in her stomach and prickled at her skin. She kept her eyes on the floor so as not to drink on the lecherous glances she was certain she would be getting. Looking down she was able to see her stuff nipples poking at the fabric.</p>
<p>"Goddamn it, go down." Gwen ordered her nipples under her breath. "How could anyone do this job with stiff nipples?"</p>
<p>Then she bumped into Matilda, who had been doing this job with stiff nipples for over a month.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"Who are you and why are you wearing a gold bikini?" Matilda asked.</p>
<p>"I'm one of the guests, I lost a bet and now I have to cover for your coworker for half an hour." Gwen explained.</p>
<p>Matilda's thoughts darted from empathy with Mercedes' frustration of the wealthy holidaying in the lives of the poor, empathy with this poor girl discovering the gold bikini for the first time, and an overriding sense of frustration that she couldn't be the beneficiary of that bet.</p>
<p>"Has Barnaby left yet?" Matilda asked as she loaded up another tray of entrées.</p>
<p>Gwen didn't know Barnaby had not left.</p>
<p>Gwen didn't know that shortly after she had ditched him to play billiards, he had found himself in a fascinating conversation with a woman in red who had quickly read him and adjusted the conversation accordingly.</p>
<p>"Yeah, at least you don't have to squeeze yourself into a scandalous dress. I'd much rather be at home, but a while ago I learnt the trick to networking at these sorts of events." She led, hoping to divert the conversation from Barnaby's seemingly endless tract on the ills of superficial networking in professional decisions.</p>
<p>"I'll take any tricks I can get." Barnaby replied.</p>
<p>"People don't bond over conversation per se, they bond over a shared experience. Naturally both experiencing a nice conversation is one thing, but the kind of people who are rich and influential aren't looking for that, they are looking for hedonistic oblivion. Find a group of men in the most expensive suits possible, then match them drink for drink, and don't be afraid to do drugs if that's what the group is doing. A first impression as a fellow partier doesn't just endear you to them, it reassures them that they aren't broken men because their demons aren't unique, and that feeling of relief is one they will get every time they see you." She explained.</p>
<p>"What if I don't want to do drugs or get drunk?" He asked. "What if I do something stupid that ruins my reputation?"</p>
<p>"This is why you match their intake, if you're intoxicated enough to think something stupid is a good idea, they're intoxicated enough to agree with you." She replied with a smirk, picking up a glass of wine from the bar and heading to the billiards table.</p>
<p>"Alright..." Barnaby said to himself, psyching himself up for what lay ahead. "Do it for Matilda."</p>
<p>"I briefly chatted to a Barnaby, but I haven't seen him since I went over to the billiards table." Gwen informed, picking up the now full tray, taking a deep breath, and re-entering the party.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ, where has he gone?" Matilda muttered to herself. She wondered if she should just take the risk and go out there, but in her moment's hesitation her boss Meagan re-entered the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Good news, your ex has gone into one of the rooms we're not allowed into. Plus the party is lively enough that even if he did emerge, he'd struggle to accidentally find you before one of the other waitresses notices him and passes on the message for you to hide.</p>
<p>Matilda picked up a tray and headed into the party, still nervous at the prospect of word getting back to her husband, but at least relieved she could earn the money needed to buy her a clear run at finals.</p>
<p>The first thing she realised was that her boss wasn't kidding when she said private gigs were more handsy. It seemed like the moment she left the safety of the kitchen, errant hands were finding their way onto her body. At first she tried to confront the owners of the offending appendages, but she couldn't tell who it was, and the party environment has normalised their wandering hands so much, she realised all she would be doing is yelling her way out of the tips she sorely needed.</p>
<p>So Matilda took what seemed like her millionth deep breath of the night, and decided to spend her time thinking about how her lack of economic means had robbed her even of bodily autonomy, mentally pulling citations from diffuse sociologists on the matter, trying to ignore that her nipples were harder than they had even been before.</p>
<p>Soon she found herself swooning with every grasp of her vulnerable body. Stripped of all class and status, she felt that although her vulnerability shouldn't have been a positive feeling, it was at least novel enough to excite her. Nobody in her circle of friends had put themselves out there like she had, nobody she knew had the strength of conviction to learn in this way or the fortitude to survive going from a respectable academic to a molested bikini server in less than 2 months. In her weakness she found strength.</p>
<p>She wasn't finding many tips though. She found she would have the odd $5 if she swiveled her head fast enough to catch someone with a hand on her bottom and then give him a cheeky smile, nothing to be sniffed at but still far less than what she would get at a night in the café.</p>
<p>As the party went on, Matilda found herself handing out far less food and fetching far more drink orders. This allowed her to stop and have conversations, try and chat up some more tips as she went. It was after a bubbly conversation with a group of men from a tech firm that the scale of her problem was made apparent.</p>
<p>"You are nice, if I still carried cash I would certainly be handing it over to you." An older management type elucidated.</p>
<p>"Wait, does nobody carry cash any more?"</p>
<p>"'fraid not darling. Everything's contactless these days. Maybe next time you could get some card readers, because you really are doing a sterling job." A self-proclaimed 'tech genius' suggested.</p>
<p>"Maybe there is a solution." Interrupted a woman in red, barging her way into the conversation. "Why don't you guys reach into your pockets, pull out your phones, and use one of those cashapps to send this poor woman a tip?"</p>
<p>"Good idea, what's your Cashday username?" A man asked.</p>
<p>"Um, I don't have one." Matilda replied. She had only recently heard of Cashday as a way to quickly source money and had not yet turned her attention to using it.</p>
<p>"Well that won't do." The woman in red proclaimed, taking out her phone to set up an account for Matilda, then holding it up while looking the other way so Matilda could put her details in. It only took a few minutes but soon the woman in red was announcing that she had set Matilda up and that everyone gathered could send her tips at the username "Sluttyserver".</p>
<p>"Thanks." Matilda genuinely said to the woman in red before she started to move on.</p>
<p>"Hold up, I've had another idea to save you a bit of time." The woman in red replied. Without even asking for permission, she took out an errant Sharpie and began to write across Matilda's cleavage.</p>
<p>'Cashday Tips: Sluttyserver'</p>
<p>"There we go, now turn around, I'm going to write it again above your butt."</p>
<p>"Go on man, next time a server walks by, just let your hand stroke her butt. Everyone's doing it and they get paid well enough for just that." Marcus implored. He had been shocked that Barnaby, far from fleeing the party, was trying his level best to get into it. He had joined up with Marcus and a group of his oldest and hardest partying friends (a group who knew Marcus and his parties well enough to sense the direction the night was taking) and began downing shots at the same rate. Marcus had been determined to get this guy to leave but his newfound commitment to trying to be one of the partiers had certainly put a damper in his plans. "Look, this one with the pink hair, she's wearing a thong, you got to get a handful of that ass."</p>
<p>Barnaby could have sworn he had talked to that woman earlier in the party, but his head was now swirling and he was second guessing his grossly incapacitated higher reasoning skills at every turn. The server walked past and Barnaby let his hand stroke and quickly cup her bottom in passing. Gwen shuddered but didn't respond, like Matilda she too had to suddenly grow used to the errant hands of the wild party.</p>
<p>Marcus' friends cheered as Barnaby looked a mixture of proud and ashamed.</p>
<p>"I hope my wife doesn't find out." He expressed with his guard down.</p>
<p>"Your wife isn't here." Marcus yelled. "But what is here is opportunity. What do you say guys, time to introduce Barnaby here to micro-dosing?"</p>
<p>His friends cheered as Marcus ushered Barnaby towards one of the rooms few people were allowed in. The ones reserved for drug use.</p>
<p>"Alright, it's been over half an hour, where's the waitress?" Gwen spat to the handful of men still at the billiards tables.</p>
<p>"Um... aren't you the waitress?" A man replied. With a start Gwen realised that everyone who had been involved in her bet had since dissolved into the rest of the party. Splitting up and getting into new and varied activities. There was no longer a group to appeal to.</p>
<p>"Shit." Gwen responded, storming away from the billiards tables. She cleared her head as best she could and thought through her next moves. She needed to either find the woman in red or the server wearing her dress.</p>
<p>Gwen wandered the party, each errant hand a reminder of the outfit she was still in. She growled with frustration as she couldn't find the women in red or the server anywhere.</p>
<p>"Where is that bitch in red and that slut in my dress?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it." The lady in red assured Matilda's co-worker by the front door of the house. She handed her another pile of twenties, then waved for a taxi from the taxi rank Marcus had arranged to wait outside the house. "I promise you, the girl lost another wager with me and now she has to cover for you for the rest of the night. Go home and relax while she earns you a paycheck."</p>
<p>"Alright, well here's her clutch. Just because she lost a bet doesn't mean she shouldn't be without her money and phone." The server pressed the clutch into the woman in red's hands, who then dropped it neatly into her larger handbag.</p>
<p>"Thank you, I'll make sure she gets it back."</p>
<p>The server uncertainly climbed into the taxi and was driven off into the night.</p>
<p>The woman in red wandered back into the party and caught the eye of Matilda as she made her way into the hall. She got out her phone and checked the Cashday app with a view to report back to Matilda how well she was doing.</p>
<p>"Well it's better than nothing." She sighed.</p>
<p>"What? Loads of people have been telling me they're going to tip me. How much is in there?" Matilda asked.</p>
<p>"$36." The woman in red replied, dividing the actual figure by 10 to push Matilda's buttons. "Maybe there's just an internet delay or something. I'm sure as they get drunker the tips will start rolling in."</p>
<p>Matilda stormed off as the woman in red continued to enjoy her evening.</p>
<p>Marcus left Barnaby behind to worry himself sick about the tiny amount of acid he had ingested ten minutes ago. As he went into the house he had an empty pride of how the party was turning out. The crowd had reached an equilibrium as the stick-in-the-muds left through his preplanned taxi rank, and the party animals invited over their friends. Some guests had jumped into the pool still fully dressed in their formal outfits, others were playing drinking games and laughing at the embarrassing secrets spilling out. The dancing to his hard pumping music was becoming more unrestrained in style and location. He could have even sworn he saw two men sat on the roof of the gazebo smoking a spliff.</p>
<p>He also saw that flash of red again. Something about that flash of red unsettled him, he couldn't put his finger on what he had noticed about it, but it seemed important.</p>
<p>"You!" Yelled Gwen as she spotted the woman in red across the house. She ploughed through the crowd and pulled herself up to her full height. "It has been three quarters of an hour. Where is the waitress with my clothes?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, I've been looking but I haven't seen her." The woman in red responded.</p>
<p>"Well what am I supposed to do? I can't spend this party swanning about in a bikini. This is an important networking event and nobody will take me seriously." Gwen ranted.</p>
<p>"What are you looking to get out of networking? I'm pretty clued up around here, maybe I can help." The woman in red replied.</p>
<p>"The main thing you can do to help is find me my clothes." Gwen sulked. She paused as the woman in red looked at her sympathetically. "Fine, my boss paid for my ticket to this party on the condition that I make one good connection for my law firm. That's the only reason I'm still here, well that and I don't have a way to pay for the taxi home."</p>
<p>"What happened to your..."</p>
<p>"Phone and purse? They were in my clutch." Gwen finished the woman in red's thought. They sat quietly for a moment before the woman in red had an idea.</p>
<p>"It's risky, but I think I have a way to get you some clothes. Once dressed you can go back to schmoozing and maybe wrangle a bonus taxi ride home."</p>
<p>"Alright everyone listen up!" The woman in red shouted from next to the beer pong table. "This young lady has unfortunately lost her dress, but she is willing to gamble for some clothes. One match of beer pong, if she wins she gets everything you're wearing except your underwear."</p>
<p>"And if whoever challenges her wins?" Someone from the gathered crowd piped up.</p>
<p>Gwen was confident, beer pong was her grift of choice at college, she had practised and perfected her hand eye coordination to the point where she could clear out frat houses without breaking a sweat. She knew she could take anyone at this party, but that didn't make her any less nervous as she stated the stakes.</p>
<p>"If I lose, the winner gets my gold bikini." Gwen yelled to an audience that fell into a deep discussion. Everyone was sizing up their potential beer pong ability, they wanted this to happen so badly but the right champion was required. Gwen simply stood awaiting her fate while the woman in red decided to start pouring the cups of beer and laying them out on the table.</p>
<p>The crowd eventually chose a man whose friends claimed him as a master of darts, hoping the skill would be transferable. He won the coin toss and got the first throw, immediately sending the ball clear over the table, not even hitting the cups. Gwen breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>She threw her first ball and her jaw dropped as it bounced off the outside edge of the cup. Missing the opening throw? It was a rookie mistake she hadn't done in years. The man took the ball and this time got his eye in and sunk it into one of Gwen's cups. He had just taken the lead.</p>
<p>'Fuck! calm down Gwen, it must have been nerves, take a deep breath and take this guy down.' Gwen thought to herself as she drained the first beer. She picked out the ball and tossed it, once again hitting the outside edge of the cup. 'What the fuck is going on?'</p>
<p>The woman in red smiled. While she was racking up the cups and all attention was elsewhere, she had taken all of Gwen's targets and added a small interceptable fold in the paper cup's base. Although it didn't look like much, it meant that all of the man's cups were leaning away from Gwen, so from her angle, the cup opening was a much smaller target than her opponents.</p>
<p>It took four throws before Gwen got her eye in and sunk her first ball. At which point her opponent had hit the target twice, then went on to sink a third ball while Gwen shook with the ramifications of her losing.</p>
<p>As Gwen's cups left the table, the man began to suffer with fewer targets on offer. His head-start meant that Gwen drew level with him when they were down to two cups a piece, but the very next throw she lost the lead again as the crowd cheered at the thought of her humiliation. She did every technique she could think of to calm herself down but it didn't work, as a mixture of her shaking hands and the rigged cups once again sent the ball bouncing away.</p>
<p>Her opponent had men massaging his shoulders, conjuring up every word of encouragement they could think of, the weight of the audience willing him on to make the shot. Gwen simply closed her eyes and hoped.</p>
<p>*Plop*</p>
<p>The nearest house was over half a mile away and could still hear the almighty cheer that rose up from the party as the final ball dropped. Hell, the nearest space station could probably have heard the commotion. Gwen simply shuddered in her defeat, then felt an almighty wave of shame as all eyes in the audience turned to her.</p>
<p>She gritted her teeth, reached behind her back and unclasped the bra, swiftly moving the bra away from her breasts in the same movement as cupping them with her arms to keep people from seeing her nipples. Then, awkwardly and with one hand, she shuffled her bikini bottoms down her legs, covering her pussy with her other free hand before straightening up and stepping out of the last vestiges of her covering.</p>
<p>She looked around at all the people staring, looking for any support or even a suggestion of what to do next. The woman in red had vanished and all that was left was a sea of hungry eyes. Gwen turned around and tried to barge through the crowd, their trademark wandering hands turned up to 11 as her naked body pushed between them.</p>
<p>The sides of Matilda's mouth was practically aching from the wide false smile she had kept plastered across her face, trying to convince rich men to part with an amount she knew was pocket change for them but would be a life changing amount for her. She had been serving a group of men when the woman in red joined the conversation.</p>
<p>"How am I doing for tips?" Matilda immediately asked. The woman in red took out her phone and calculated carefully, looking at Matilda's recent tips she was able to guess how much she had gotten from the men present to add to her total.</p>
<p>"You've nipped over the $100 mark." She replied, Matilda was not able to hide her disappointment. "Jesus Christ, now there's how you ask for tips."</p>
<p>The woman in red steered the whole group's attention to Gwen running naked through the party before locking herself in the toilet.</p>
<p>"There's a thought." One of the gathered men announced. "Think how many tips you would get if you lost the gold bikini."</p>
<p>"I've had lots of assurances I would be tipped well and none of them have come true, I'm not getting naked on the off chance this time you aren't lying to me." Matilda indignantly stated.</p>
<p>"So it's not the nudity that you object to, it's the uncertainty of payment." The man deduced. "In which case let's settle that now. This lady says you have made $100ish in tips so far. If everyone here matches that, that would be a $500 boost to your tip pot right off the bat. Once you have confirmation that you are $500 richer, would you be willing to dispense with the bikini for the rest of the night."</p>
<p>Matilda wanted to say 'no.' Actually she wanted to say 'fuck no!' Actually she wanted to say 'fuck no!' before spitting in this man's face and storming out. Did this guy really think he could get women to degrade themselves just by offering them money?</p>
<p>Yes, because he can.</p>
<p>Sure there were sexual connotations muddying the waters, but this was no different to other capitalist exploitation that Matilda had been learning about. She had forced gardners to come in on their weekend or builders to come fix her house in the middle of the night, each time offering money so that her workers would trade their comfort for her pleasure. How was that different to this?</p>
<p>Every time she called upon her courage to say no, she remembered the disapproval that dripped from Mercedes. The only reason she had to say no, would be that she was in a privileged enough position to turn down $500. If she baulked at this she would be acknowledging that she was still just vacationing in the working class lifestyle, bailing the moment it got hard, like leaving a holiday early because the weather turned sour.</p>
<p>"$500 up front." She stated to a sudden rush of excited men. They all fumbled their phones out of their pockets like excitable teenagers and began pounding the screen as fast as their fingers could move.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Eventually the woman in red confirmed what the men all claimed, they had each transferred $100 into Matilda's account, adding up to the payday she promised she would honour.</p>
<p>Matilda undid the clasp of the bra and pulled it away from the spray on adhesive holding it in place. She had gotten used to the slight sting of removing her bra in this way as a price for not showing off her nipples to customers, now it was the exact opposite. She placed her bra on a tray and shuddered at her exposure, her vestigial class baggage screaming at her that she was whoring herself out, that she was better than this. She knew she was better than this, but she also knew a lot of other people were better than this and still went through this experience regularly, so she silenced that voice as she peeled off her bikini bottoms and placed them on the tray. She then gathered up the empty glasses and continued into the party, internally screaming with embarrassment and shame.</p>
<p>"You sure that was a microdose?" Barnaby asked for the hundredth time.</p>
<p>"You're fine, man." One of Marcus' friends reassured for the hundredth time. "Come on, we can't stay in here all night. Let's go out into the party and have some fun."</p>
<p>Barnaby stepped out into the party and felt the world pulse with his movement. He had to admit, it wasn't the melting reality and endless colourful fractals TV had told him hallucinogens induce, instead the physicality of the world bent to the thrum of his own body. If he felt a little melty the walls would oblige, if he decided to stop and stare at a fascinating pattern, the pattern would dance for him, reality was something that simply stepped aside in the moments when Barnaby had other things to focus on.</p>
<p>Barnaby giggled.</p>
<p>Barnaby then realised the acid was swirling amongst a huge volume of liquid. He spent a moment musing about the collection of fluids sloshing around his stomach, not allowed to mingle with other fluids until they had been corrected by his bodily processes. His body had to be pretty fascist against those poor liquids. If it wasn't, he would die, but that didn't make it any less sad. Then again the processes weren't perfect, otherwise he wouldn't be tripping balls. So fascism mixed with incompetence at least means fun in a biological sense.</p>
<p>"Wait, where did I start again?" Barnaby said far louder than he thought he had.</p>
<p>Liquids...</p>
<p>'How would you imprison a liquid, it's all sloshy, it would just slosh through the bars. My liquids certainly feel sloshy as they wait for the Gestapo of enzymes, valves, and nodes to correct them to be productive members of the totalitarian regime of my body.'</p>
<p>"Pee! I need to shit." Barnaby yelled. He stopped for a second and decided he needed to take another run at that sentence, the words were right but the order was wrong. Not wrong, inaccurate, there is a difference but Barnaby forgot what it was for a second. He had also forgotten what the accurate statement he was aiming for was. Maybe the underground resistance of fluids had smuggled it away, maybe that sloshing was them celebrating a strike against the evil empire of his body, or maybe it was...</p>
<p>"Shit! I need to pee."</p>
<p>Barnaby thrummed towards the toilet, he opened the door, apologised to the door, closed the door, apologised to himself, opened the door again, stepped inside the bathroom this time, apologised to his reflection in the mirror, closed the door, apologised to the lock, locked the door, then realised he had been on the verge of pissing himself over for this whole interaction so he should have been hurrying.</p>
<p>He apologised to his sense of urgency.</p>
<p>After spending 3 years, 4 minutes, and a day peeing, Barnaby stood up and drew in a deep breath. The room expanded and contracted with his breath and he found it novel enough to take a few more deep breaths and giggle at the room moving with him.</p>
<p>He walked over and unlocked the door...</p>
<p>"Oh wait." He yelled to himself before remembering he didn't need to speak. 'Let's splash some water on my face, that's what they do in the movies.'</p>
<p>He went to the sink and splashed some water on his face.</p>
<p>'There we go, that helps, I think I'm through the worst of it. Look how the water is sparkling, that's normal. Look how the toilet roll is sparkling... wait, that's still...'</p>
<p>Barnaby splashed water against his face a few more times.</p>
<p>"Alright that fixed everything. I doubt I'm even high any more." Barnaby said to himself. He turned around and watched as a naked woman with pink hair barged her way into the toilet, locking the door behind herself.</p>
<p>Barnaby splashed water against his face a lot more times.</p>
<p>Gwen was amazed at how confusion could push even fear and mortification out of her mind. She entered the toilet to see Barnaby stare at her in fear and then begin relentlessly splashing water on his face, and she even stopped covering herself in the weirdness of it all.</p>
<p>"Alright, cards on the table, I took a bunch of acid and now it looks like you're naked. Now I didn't think that's how hallucinations worked and I promise I'm not trying to be a creepy guy but..."</p>
<p>"It's alright, that's not the acid, I am actually naked." Gwen interrupted, sensing that Barnaby needed even more help than her getting to grips with the situation.</p>
<p>"Ah, agriculture." Barnaby knowingly acknowledged.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>There was an awkward silence that lasted somewhere between 4 seconds and 13 years.</p>
<p>"I suppose we should go deal with them." Barnaby acknowledged, decisively heading towards the door.</p>
<p>"Who? What? No!" Gwen stuttered, throwing her body in the way and physically bouncing Barnaby away from the door.</p>
<p>"My left bicep touched your nipple." Barnaby shamefully informed as he looked at the floor.</p>
<p>"It's fine, I've had worse tonight, which is why I'm not leaving this room." Gwen replied.</p>
<p>"We can't leave the room?" Barnaby asked, his eyes growing wide.</p>
<p>"I mean you can, I just..."</p>
<p>"Nope, don't like that. I need to be able to leave rooms I've arrived in, otherwise other rooms will be un-arrived upon." Barnaby explained, beginning to freak out.</p>
<p>"You can leave the room whenever you want, I'm just choosing not to." Gwen calmly explained to the increasingly agitated Barnaby.</p>
<p>"Well that's no way to establish your brand." Barnaby replied with the most serious look he could muster, then his face softened. "You're nice. Trustworthy. You have said nice words to this old Knickerbocker even though you didn't have to. Well I'm going to leave now."</p>
<p>Gwen rolled her eyes and then had a moment of guilt for what a man in this state could expect from the party.</p>
<p>"Before you go, a few more nice words." She sighed before he could get to the door. "This night is good and people are good..." Everything Gwen had experienced tonight said otherwise but she feared for this man having a bad trip. "Things may feel incomprehensible, but as long as you stay at the house until the acid wears off, and out of the swimming pool, and kitchen, then no bad things should happen to you."</p>
<p>Gwen then gave the man a hug, trying to ignore the feeling of his suit pressing against her bare skin. Barnaby awkwardly rearranged his hands to try and take in the genuine warmth of the hug without ruining it by touching something rude like her butt or shoulder blades.</p>
<p>"Thank you, that does make me feel stronger. I feel like I could handle anything." He announced, before stepping out of the toilet and immediately seeing his wife serving drinks naked.</p>
<p>'Shit!' thought Meagan as she snaked through the party, ignoring the occasional squeeze of her bottom that she thought she wouldn't have to deal with again when she made manager. She had just seen Matilda's husband leave the private room, humm at a vase, gurgle at the ceiling, then walk to the toilet while wiggling. 'I can see why Matilda dumped his ass.'</p>
<p>She felt that if she could find Matilda, she could hide her in the kitchen again until this weirdo left the toilet and found a new area of the party to settle down in. But she couldn't find her anywhere. She saw a large crowd and a commotion by the beer pong table and decided to see if Matilda was nearby, instead she arrived just in time to see Gwen peeling off her bikini and exposing her naked body to the crowd.</p>
<p>'She isn't one of my employees.' Meagan thought to herself. She was about to get involved when the poor girl pushed her way through the crowd and ran away. 'As much as I want to find out what is going on, that is not my most pressing problem.'</p>
<p>She searched mostly the outside area as that's where the big tippers were hanging out and Matilda always had a keen eye for who had means and motive to tip well. She searched every corner of the garden, getting more and more worried by the moment and never spotting Matilda.</p>
<p>"...So how about it sweetheart?" A drunk man concluded. Matilda's boss had not been listening to the first part of a conversation he drunkenly thought was mutual, and asked him to repeat itself. "Are all the waitresses willing to serve the party naked for $500 or was that other one special? Because I'm sure me and my friends would be willing to club together to see more of you."</p>
<p>"Which way did the naked waitress go?" She barked. The man stayed schtum but his eyes darted from the billiards table area back to her and then she knew.</p>
<p>Matilda had been uncomfortably getting on with her job since she surrendered her bikini. She was trying to rise above her humiliation through academic curiosity. The transferability of the forms of power working in inverse, whereby someone's weakness in transactional power had been converted into a weakness in reputational power and infra-political authority.</p>
<p>But a stranger running his finger across the opening of your pussy does tend to interrupt the train of thought.</p>
<p>Matilda had thought that the errant hands were bad enough before, but now she was naked, people no longer felt the need to be restrained or subtle. Before it was mostly her bottom getting caressed with the odd brave man reaching over to squeeze her breasts before quickly making sure his hand returned to the anonymity of the surging crowd. But now that Matilda was naked, it was understood that she had fully crossed the line of consenting to be a raw sexual being, so nobody felt the need to hide their desires any more. Men would stand in her path and grab both of her breasts with their hands, kneading them for a couple of seconds without shame. Worse still, now her pussy was exposed to the world, it also found itself the target of wandering hands, the probing fingers asserting themselves on her labia as best as they could as she moved past.</p>
<p>Matilda hoped at the very least she was still earning tips. Everyone had eaten their fill a while ago so food service had been reduced to a table of leftovers people could go back to if they wanted a snack, and everyone had stopped ordering Matilda to get them drinks since they didn't want to earn the ire their friends would direct at them if they sent away the only nude waitress, so Matilda focussed on cleaning up empty glasses and errant plates while enduring the ongoing violation.</p>
<p>When she got to the billiards tables a man took one look at her and menace filled his face.</p>
<p>"So you're doing this for tips right? Must be desperate for money. What else would you do for a tip?"</p>
<p>"None of you will be fucking me tonight." Matilda sternly stated.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright. Misread the room much? I'm just talking about a bit of mischief. I'll tip you $50 if I can draw a penis on your ass." He offered, collapsing into laughter with his friends that was cut silent by Matilda's response.</p>
<p>"OK. But I want to watch you make the payment." Matilda agreed. She watched him send the tip through Cashday, then turned around and offered her ass for its humiliation. She wondered where all these Sharpies were coming from as she felt the tip of the pen gliding over her buttcheek. After a couple of moments she twisted her body to see the damage, a thick black line drawing of a penis pointing directly at her anus.</p>
<p>"How much to draw another one on your tits." A different man asked.</p>
<p>By the time Matilda's boss found her, a man was in the middle of writing 'whore' across her stomach. Meagan was too late to stop the penises drawn on her bottom, left breast, thigh, and pubis.</p>
<p>"What the fuck are you doing?" She yelled with such intensity, Matilda's new high rollers immediately awkwardly cleared out.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I was going to pool the tips with the other servers and kitchen staff. I'm not a hog." Matilda reassured, thinking that was the main problem her boss had.</p>
<p>"You're naked and letting men draw on you!"</p>
<p>"I also have rent and bills due, we all do, so five hundred bucks for my nudity and fifty bucks a pop for the drawings means we all won't have to worry for a bit after this party." Matilda explained.</p>
<p>"What if this gets out? We could lose our licence."</p>
<p>"Private party full of lawyers who will want us at future parties, we'll be more covered than you can imagine if this somehow makes it out." Matilda reasoned. Her boss thought it through and decided as long as Matilda was taking all the flack she didn't mind raking in the tips. She almost walked away before realising the actual reason she had been looking for Matilda.</p>
<p>"Your husband is..."</p>
<p>"What the fuck?" Yelled Barnaby from the edge of the billiards area. Matilda had one moment to take in what had just happened, and another to flee out the back door and jump into the swimming pool hoping to evade him.</p>
<p>How Tara Tilly ended up at the party</p>
<p>"Do I have to go?" I asked petulantly.</p>
<p>"Yes, my wife gets back in ten minutes." My lover replied, anxiously packing up my things.</p>
<p>"Urgh." I sighed. I can't believe it had happened again. Fuck me for chatting up age appropriate men I guess. Once I hit my mid thirties it seemed the only men interested in me were either a couple of decades older, creepily younger, or married. I know I'm hot even if I have to constantly reassure myself about it all the time. Luscious strawberry blonde hair with just the right amount of curly bounce, a bit too curvaceous for the average shallow man but an almighty bust that dominated all discourse about my body, I knew I was a catch, but somehow all I could land were creeps.</p>
<p>This guy didn't have a ring on when I struck up a conversation in the bar. It was not a cheap bar and he kept buying me drinks so I knew I was doing well for myself. When I decided to go back to his, we got a taxi to the posh area of town and I thought I had hit the jackpot. I even took an Addyi on the road, a pleasure drug a friend told me about, so I would be chemically horned up and ready for a good time.</p>
<p>Then we had sex.</p>
<p>I can usually tell a married man by the way he has sex. It's like I'm a rally car and he's a drag racer, well tuned but for a different body. He did this thing where he nibbled my earlobe that did nothing for me, but made him smile like he knew about a secret second clitoris.</p>
<p>His bad rhythm barely changed as he fucked me doggy style, like he was used to a woman whose body swayed and reacted in time with his own. So when he was done I was left worked up and unsatisfied, abandoned to his ringing phone, then told to leave as quickly as possible. Not the worst one night stand I had ever had but in my bottom five.</p>
<p>I'd taken revenge on these cheating assholes before and decided to do it again. I got dressed and went to his bathroom despite his protests. Then I rolled my knickers down under my white summer dress and left them in the medicine cabinet.</p>
<p>Next I clumsily removed my bra, pulled it out from the sleeveless shoulder of my outfit, and left it dangling behind the shower curtain.</p>
<p>'She's bound to find one of them and then that prick will have some questions to answer.' I thought to myself as I strutted out of the bathroom.</p>
<p>"Come on, come on, let's go." He ordered, banishing any lingering crumbs of guilt I had.</p>
<p>"Did you book me a taxi?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, my wife is going to be here any minute, she can't see a taxi." He garbled in a panic.</p>
<p>"Cool, I'll just walk home then, I bet these high heels make great hiking boots." I sarcastically yelled back as he used charades to beg me to keep my voice down. I decided I wasn't going to get anything out of him and walked to the front door, then was tackled like a president with an over cautious security detail as headlights shone in the front garden.</p>
<p>Now I was on the same page as him. I was happy to ruin his marriage but the number of women who blamed me when their shitbag husbands pretended to be single was absurd. What am I supposed to do, keep a register of marriages with me at all times to cross reference my potential lovers on before I go home with them? I wanted out of there before fists started flying.</p>
<p>I ran to the back garden and he opened the gate leading out into the dark rolling hills of the night time countryside. Then I was alone.</p>
<p>'Fuck!' I realised with a start, 'that asshole still has my handbag.' I wondered what to do alone on the foothills with nothing but my dress and the high heels I now held in my hand as my bare feet took one step at a time on cool dewy grass. 'Where do I even go?'</p>
<p>At that moment, by way of response a huge cheer rose from a neighbouring house. They were having a party, hopefully they have some heart for a poor woman wronged by a fucking asshole. Hell, if I was lucky I could stay there tonight and venture back to his place in the morning to retrieve my stuff.</p>
<p>Plus before one of them gives me a lift home, maybe they can actually fuck me to orgasm. It certainly wasn't helping my state of sexual frustration to be walking commando in a summer dress, feeling the fabric caressing my skin and my unclad nethers tingling every time the wind picked up enough to lift the skirt. The Addyi was doing its job far too well and every step just made me hornier.</p>
<p>It took some time but eventually I arrived at my new destination, ravenous with surfing lust. There was nobody gatekeeping the entrance so I just walked in.</p>
<p>This party was wild, there were girls in bikinis, wild games, people at all various stages of fucked up. This was the dream party of some of the teenage boys who had tried to cast me as a cougar in their coming of age fantasies.</p>
<p>'Alright.' I thought to myself, 'maybe I'm not that much in a hurry to head out.'</p>
<p>I grabbed a glass of wine from a bar, then realised I had some catching up to do after the sobering experience I had just been through so drained a couple of shots of something that tasted like fermented unspecified fruit. As I headed outside to the pool, a confident man in a suit stepped in front of me.</p>
<p>"Naughty naughty, you're not on the guest list." He cheekily chastised. "And I would know, my name is Marcus Selassie and this is my party."</p>
<p>He was being cheeky and casually throwing his status into the conversation. This man was interested, and maybe if he threw parties this wild, he'd be just as wild in the bedroom.</p>
<p>"Tara." I replied by way of an introduction. "I was in the neighbourhood and couldn't help but come inside."</p>
<p>"I can tell you're going to fit right in. I need risk takers like you to kick this party up a notch." If this was insufficiently wild for him, I was filled with wonder and dread about how far he wanted to go. "How are you at twister?"</p>
<p>"Terrible." I honestly replied downing my drink. "But always up for practice."</p>
<p>"Alright then. I'm going to get you another drink then we'll meet at the twister mat. I'm also going to use that time to think of a good forfeit for the loser." Marcus announced, snaking his way into the party and leaving me optimistic and thrumming with anticipation, I was learning first hand how horny drugs interacted with too much alcohol.</p>
<p>I walked around the perimeter of the pool towards the twister mats, my mind racing with possibilities and clouding with intoxication. This night may go from bottom five to top three, I hadn't had this much excitement since I was at college, this is going to get freaky.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>I remember a flash of red, trailing red fabric blowing in the breeze caused by the rapid movement of the subject it clung to. I remember the sudden forceful feeling of an unrelenting shoulder against my chest. I then remember falling. Then the last thing I remember before hitting the water, was a woman sarcastically chirping "oops."</p>
<p>The pool embraced me, then as I surfaced for air I realised my white summer dress was also embracing me. My mind whirred at the thought of how I was supposed to get out without anyone seeing me, when a naked woman covered in graffiti ran out of the house and jumped into the pool next to me.</p>
<p>'That can't have been...' Barnaby mused to himself. 'That looked just like Matilda. I mean I have nudity on the brain, maybe that's the latest in the hallucinations. But that's not how the hallucinations have been happening so far, I haven't been seeing things that aren't there, I've been seeing more on the things that are there.'</p>
<p>Barnaby checked the reactions of the party around him, they all seemed to have responded to what had just unfolded. Meagan even looked at him sheepishly, unable to hide the emotions of the situation.</p>
<p>'Holy shit, my wife is at this party and she hasn't got any clothes.' Barnaby realised before retracing her steps towards the pool.</p>
<p>Matilda swam close to the edge of the pool to hide from Barnaby while Tara swam likewise to avoid everyone. So naturally they ended up next to each other, equally confused by the other's predicament.</p>
<p>"I'm Matilda and I'll be your waitress today." Matilda suggested with an upwards inflection, hoping to match the ridiculousness of the situation and so remove the tension.</p>
<p>"Tara, worlds fastest party crasher." Tara joked.</p>
<p>"Matilda? I'm sorry my eyeballs scared you." Barnaby yelled as he tried to find his wife. Matilda sank as low as she could in the water. Tara looked around and saw Marcus coming back with her drink and decided to wave him over.</p>
<p>"Hey there Marcus..." she began before pausing at the look of wonder in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Jumping into the swimming pool in a white summer dress with no underwear? You are awesome." He gushed. "Not only that but you're hanging out with the freakiest of the servers. You are the hero this party needed."</p>
<p>Tara felt a warm blush rise up from her stomach.</p>
<p>"Well, I just thought..."</p>
<p>"Were you trying to get the waitress to join in our game of twister?" He asked.</p>
<p>"Well, if you..."</p>
<p>"$200." Matilda interrupted. "And you'd have to find a way to get rid of Barnaby."</p>
<p>Marcus' face dropped, he'd been trying to get rid of Barnaby all night.</p>
<p>"Hi Matilda." Barnaby added as he leaned over the edge of the pool. "Are you naked?"</p>
<p>"Honey, it's not what it looks like, I'm studying Marxism." Matilda pleaded in response.</p>
<p>Marcus signalled to Tara that they should leave as this was about to get awkward. Tara desperately wrangled with which would be more awkward, stepping out of the pool in this state or dealing with the incoming marital dispute, decided that she'd had enough of people's ruined nuptials for one night and swam towards the ladder.</p>
<p>Weirdly enough, once Marcus and Tara had snuck away, Barnaby nodded knowingly</p>
<p>"Yeah, this can happen when you get into critical class theory." He observed, offering Matilda a hand to pull her out of the water. He took a moment to marvel at his wife, brazenly naked and covered in crude drawings, before turning back into Matilda's explanation that was already in progress.</p>
<p>Matilda was shocked that as she went through all the events that had led her to that moment, the twists, turns, and more importantly the justifications, Barnaby seemed lock step with her. The philosophies she espoused were complimented as revelatory by her husband, he was having a life changing experience listening to the deep things his wife had learnt.</p>
<p>She didn't know that he was on enough acid that he would have responded with similar horizon broadening enthusiasm if she had read the plot of the Rugrats movie to him.</p>
<p>"That makes so much sense. I can't believe I never saw it that way before." Barnaby gushed as Matilda finished her story. "And I'm so glad we finally reconnected. It felt like we were driving apart, I didn't realise you felt ashamed of your lessons and didn't want to share but how lucky you did because it was all invigorating. I'm here because I wanted to network so I could get a partnership..."</p>
<p>"But you hate networking." Matilda interrupted.</p>
<p>"I do, but I hated the idea of growing apart from you more so I figured partnership would give me more time to share more of your life with me. We can start right now." Barnaby triumphantly announced grabbing Matilda by the hand and leading her over to the twister mat where Marcus was still chatting with Tara who was desperately trying to figure out how she could get into something less revealing. "If you want to do naked twister with my wife, it will be $250, because of class warfare."</p>
<p>While Barnaby smiled at Matilda like he had just made an incisive order, Matilda sighed and Marcus looked taken aback.</p>
<p>"That is fucking hilarious, I'll cover that." A man in the crowd announced.</p>
<p>"Alright pay up fatcat." Barnaby ordered, watching the man take out his app and process the payment.</p>
<p>Marcus couldn't help but chuckle, this was certainly a memory. Meanwhile Tara was a bit annoyed that she wouldn't have Marcus' undivided attention, but was happy that she wouldn't have the gathered crowds undivided attention.</p>
<p>So the game began: Marcus, Tara, and Matilda began to slowly do the stuttering and awkward dance of a game of twister, each turn forcing them to contort into another position. One moment Tara would feel self conscious having to lean backwards and show off her summer dress tightly clinging to her body, the next Matilda would readjust and be bent over for the crowds delight.</p>
<p>Barnaby felt a tight pang in his chest as he watched his wife expose herself in a variety of positions as the crowd cheered her on. Was it guilt? Or empathy with her abject humiliation? Eventually the machinations of his brain pulled away from these correct answers to a much more wrong answer.</p>
<p>"This isn't Marxism any more, she's not making money." He yelled, confusing everyone, especially Matilda. "The two rich people get to play for fun because they are bourgeoisie, but the working class needs to struggle to earn. Alright everyone, tip my wife $100 and I'll empty this can of whipped cream onto her."</p>
<p>Matilda was about to tell her husband to shut the fuck up, but couldn't has she shuddered at the sudden assault of whipped cream covering her body, her husband hadn't even waited for the tips to roll in. She then felt the unmistakable feeling of Marcus' tongue lapping a bit of excess cream off of her nipple.</p>
<p>Tara could feel the night getting away from her, Marcus was now starting to show this other woman more attention, the sexual dance of twister mixed with the increasing intoxication of her earlier alcohol and drug intake catching up with her meant that she needed to hold his attention, she needed to get that man's cock to finish the job the other prick couldn't.</p>
<p>"This is just getting in the way." Tara announced to the audience, peeling her wet dress away from her naked body and placing it to the side of the mat. She twisted to ensure her breasts were right in Marcus' face, then ordered Barnaby over with another can of whipped cream.</p>
<p>The queue outside the toilet was starting to stretch deep into the house, but Gwen held firm despite the increasingly angry knocks at the door and the over-watering of nearby pot plants. She knew she would stay in there until everyone left.</p>
<p>Or at least until an enterprising party guest used a coin to turn the lock from the other side.</p>
<p>"Sorry but I need to piss." A woman apologised as Gwen just sat in the corner covering herself. The woman finished up, washed her hands, then left as the next party member walked in with the same apology and disregard for Gwen's crisis.</p>
<p>'Great, now I'm a toilet ornament.' Gwen thought to herself. 'How could this get any worse?'</p>
<p>"Are you part of the facilities?" A pervy man asked with an unmistakable erection.</p>
<p>"Well that's my cue to leave." Gwen replied storming out of the toilet. Privacy went both ways and if she was exposed at least she wouldn't be taken advantage of behind a locked door. She stepped out into the party and once again all eyes and hands were on her. Eventually she was spotted by the woman in red.</p>
<p>"There you are, I've been looking all over for you, I have a solution to your problem." She announced running to Gwen.</p>
<p>"No fucking way, you always seem to make everything worse." Gwen replied, but didn't move as people backed off when she was arguing with another woman.</p>
<p>"No, this will work. I found a group of men from a farming consortium looking for legal representation." The woman explained as she led Gwen outside. "They're willing to do another bet with you, no matter what happens they'll give you a set of clothes and your firm can have their business. All they ask is that if you lose, well they have this trade magazine that... that..."</p>
<p>Gwen looked over to see that the woman in red had trailed off. She followed the path of her vision to a twister mat where Marcus was busy licking various toppings off two naked women as they contorted around his body.</p>
<p>"Marcus!" The woman in red yelled.</p>
<p>"Juliette?" Marcus yelled in shock. "What the fuck are you doing here?"</p>
<p>What the fuck Juliette Selassie was doing at the party</p>
<p>"Do I have to go?" I asked petulantly.</p>
<p>"You know very well I have nowhere else to go. You have your place in Washington." Marcus replied, his head in his hands.</p>
<p>"Cool, you're having a crisis of confidence in our marriage and your brilliant solution is for me to pay massively out of pocket to catch whatever red-eye has a slot just to spare you the indignity of staying in a hotel. Fuck that, you want to have a break or call time or whatever euphenism you want to use, the least you can do is drag your sorry ass to a Best Western." I yelled, Marcus didn't fight back, he just silently complied. That was not a good sign.</p>
<p>My relationship with Marcus was based on a foundation of truth, entire and complete. We loved each other, we loved our flaws and pitfalls, we shared a stupid life together and laughed at the idea that either of us needed to change a single thing about ourselves for our relationship to click.</p>
<p>From the foundation of truth, we built a life, an edifice of lies. He went into law and very quickly those rough edges of his began to be smoothed. I went into political fundraising, where any hint of a scandal could rule me out of an entire industry.</p>
<p>I once managed to sneak in and streak a full lap of the outer edge of the Harvard Yard, winning myself free drinks for a month. I was only able to do this because Marcus organised an impromptu fireworks display just to distract campus security. Now we sat at home and calmly discussed which brands of whiskey were fancy enough to not be insulting to party guests/political donors but still with a reasonable price point. (The secret is to do bulk orders with smaller Scottish distilleries that they won't have heard of, then use their obscurity as proof of... urgh, why am I so proud and engaged with this meaningless nonsense.)</p>
<p>So our relationship didn't rot from the core, that was strong, it didn't explode dramatically, I would have preferred that to be honest, we just moved to a point where everything that was once honest was only held in nostalgia. Marcus broke first, mid-life crises always hit men earlier and harder. He thought back to our wild days and the growing frustration we had been domesticated. In service of building a better life together, we had slowly allowed ourselves to forget everything that made us want that life together in the first place.</p>
<p>This obligation to each other was stunting our reinvention, Marcus assured me that what he wanted was for us to get back in touch with ourselves before getting back together, whenever I'd heard similar sentiments expressed by big donors, I knew by the next time I saw them, they would have around 50% less assets to use for donations (give or take depending on the abilities of the couples respective divorcelawyers).</p>
<p>"Fine." I interrupted as Marcus wearily began to stand up to pack. "I'm the more mobile one, this house was always a bit more you than me, I'll go stay at a nice hotel by the airport and fly out to Washington whenever I can."</p>
<p>"Thank you." Marcus replied, sitting back down again. "I want this to work out. You know that right? I just want some chaos back in my life, all this structure is suffocating both of us."</p>
<p>"You want to fuck someone else, is that it?"</p>
<p>"Not especially, but not exactly no either. I just want to feel like me again." Marcus desperately tried to explain, before hitting on a good way to explain himself. "I used to think you were the vision of passion when you wore red. It really suited you."</p>
<p>"You know I can't anymore. I'm a senior fundraiser with the DNC, red is the colour of the enemy." I replied, working off a script I had oft repeated.</p>
<p>"There's no enemies at home. If we went out to a restaurant I doubt anyone would recognise you or cause a fuss if you wore red. But along the line you learned to flourish in a world with these stupid rules and there was no reason to buy red dresses any more. Take that one process, and apply it to everything in our lives. And we stuck with it because we pooled our successes and saw what was good for either career was good for us. We need to break that link so we can have a look at ourselves and actually see something." Marcus explained. It didn't matter if this made sense or not, these were personal discussions with personal responses.</p>
<p>"Go jack off in a river." I sneered as I stormed out of the door.</p>
<p>Manipulation had always been my natural talent, then nurtured and grown at the behest of my political life. Looking into someone's eyes and seeing what it would take to manoeuvre them into where I wanted them. So when I moved to Washington and re-lived that argument over in my head, it was not about learning lessons, it was about what I should have done to convince Marcus to drop this stupid idea that had wiggled into his head. It wasn't until I had spent a bit of time apart that I realised what I missed about the relationship and what I didn't.</p>
<p>I hadn't done coke in almost a decade when I tried some at a staffers party, and the next day when I finally was functional again, all I could think was that Marcus and I should do coke together again some time. Parties were now just as much a professional arrangement as zoom calls and quarterly reports.</p>
<p>Worst still, as my sex life dried up, I realised how vanilla everyone else was. At an office poker night where I was the oldest by a good few years, I suggested a round of strip poker and was met with similar looks to if I had suggested we break into the zoo and ride all the animals. Marcus had tied me naked in the boot of his car while he went to a drive through as a forfeit for picking the wrong team to win the Superbowl, and that was in the supposedly tame part of our lives.</p>
<p>I didn't want to give up my success, but I did start to see Marcus' resolve that we should be using our expanded means to indulge our wild sides, not bury them.</p>
<p>I didn't keep too close an eye on Marcus during this time. Some cryptic social media posts told me he was having some wild nights out. As co-owner of the house I had to approve building work he had planned to install party bars and clear room for a large jacuzzi, revamp the kitchen, and generally shift our house into more of a party pad. But his lack of contact incensed me.</p>
<p>So one day I spot an invite to a fundraising party at our recently renovated house, and I decide that this should be my chance to make a grand entrance back into Marcus' life. If he wanted a wild party, I would work every moving part in the crowd to ensure things get as wild as possible. He will have an unforgettable mess of a night and then I'll reveal myself and let him know I always had his back. Announcing my presence ahead of time wouldn't do, I need a shock revelation that he need not hold back around me, and that I was on board this entire time.</p>
<p>I bought a scandalously opulent red dress and booked a flight home, Marcus was about to rediscover what made us great.</p>
<p>Juliette had spent the party sewing chaos, all semblance of decency discarded for sex, drugs, and rock and roll. But the covert nature of her mission came to an abrupt end when she saw her husband on a twister mat, licking whipped cream off Tara's nipples.</p>
<p>Juliette paused for a moment, her brain whirring with possibilities, her many schemes and plans that she had been working throughout the party came crashing down around her. She had hoped that by pushing Tara in the pool she would retreat from the party and Marcus' flirtation would come to an abrupt halt, but she failed to realise how well she had introduced casual nudity to the assorted guests. There were even a few strip games starting up in various corners that she had not orchestrated.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" Tara finally asked, breaking the silence.</p>
<p>"This is Juliette." Marcus sheepishly informed. "She's my wife."</p>
<p>"God fucking damnit." Tara responded, walking away from the twister mat. "Seriously, do I have a wedding ring magnet in my vagina."</p>
<p>"Oh don't worry about that." Juliette calmed, not wanting the party to turn sour and sensing an opportunity. "You are a very attractive lady and my husband is only human. Keep having fun. Hell I'll even join in if that makes you feel less guilty."</p>
<p>"Um, no thanks." Tara responded, trying to get the measure of the situation. "I mean he's cool, but I'm not into sharing." Just then, Juliette had an idea.</p>
<p>"You guys wait here, I have an idea. Marcus, come chat a moment." She said waving him to one side.</p>
<p>"Look, I'm sorry but..." Marcus began.</p>
<p>"No, wait. Shut up a second. I've been working overtime to make this party awesome and we are on the brink of something great here." Juliette interrupted. "From what I have seen, we have the ingredients to put on a show and truly make this party unforgettable.</p>
<p>Marcus smiled to see his wife excited and chaotic, waiting for her suggestion.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, who's ready for a competition. Today we are going to crown the queen of this party." Juliette announced to an audience she had gathered around the gazebo. Tara, Gwen, and Matilda awkwardly stood naked behind her. "So let's welcome our contestants!"</p>
<p>Matilda</p>
<p>Juliette discussed things with me and Barnaby. Promising not only a big payday if I competed in her competition, with a bonus if I did win, but also that she would hook Barnaby up with a law firm that would be willing to open partnership discussions with him.</p>
<p>She never mentioned the punishment for losing.</p>
<p>Gwen</p>
<p>Juliette told me about a consortium that was looking for a lawyer that she had sweet talked into favouring Blackmore &amp; Jones for representation in a court case she knew was coming down the line. She even said that she had a talented up and coming lawyer who would be interested in investing in the firm and becoming a partner. All I had to do was compete in her party games and I could return to my boss claiming the games were a complete success.</p>
<p>She never mentioned there was a punishment for the loser.</p>
<p>Tara</p>
<p>Twister had clearly lowered my defences, plus Juliette seemed to look into my soul and see what I wanted. I was feeling undesirable and not in control of my destiny, somehow she managed to convince me this was a way to have the pick of any man at the party, and take charge of my destiny while I was at it. I probably would have said no while sober but I went for it.</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>I definitely would have said no if I knew there was a punishment for the loser.</p>
<p>Juliette finished her introductions, gave Marcus a cheeky smile, then removed her red dress.</p>
<p>"And finally, myself, Juliette Selassie, will be competing in the games." She announced as she unclipped her bra, wiggled out of her knickers, and joined the lineup of contestants. Marcus stepped forward to continue with the announcement.</p>
<p>"There will be 3 games of skill, where the winner will get 3 points, silver medal gets 2, bronze gets 1 and loser gets 0. At the end of the games, we will count up the points and the contestant with the most wins will be crowned queen of the party and get a fabulous prize, I dunno a spa holiday or something." Marcus explained, following the script Juliette had given him. "They have agreed that the woman with the least points is the loser, and will spend the rest of the party tied naked to the sundae bar."</p>
<p>Gwen, Tara, and Matilda all gasped in shock at the stunning announcement, but the cheers of the crowd drowned out their meek protestations. Nonetheless, none of them walked away.</p>
<p>"Our first game is a simple one, so far nobody has used the jelly wrestling arena I so painstakingly created, so we're going to have our contestants compete to pin the other to the base of the paddling pool." Marcus explained, leading people towards the large paddling pool he had set up for the purpose. It was decided to make this first round a tournament structure and the women drew lots to see who they would fight in the first round, with Matilda facing off against Tara and Juliette set to take on Gwen.</p>
<p>Matilda and Tara climbed in and steadied themselves, even though it was known that the whole point of the jelly was to be slippery, there was a world of difference between knowing it and feeling it. At Marcus' command the match started, with Matilda immediately grabbing Tara. The top-heavy Tara didn't need much help to slip over and felt herself tumbling down with the shock of Matilda's grasp. The crowd bayed for more as the women rolled around in the jelly, covering their bodies and making it hard for either to get a good enough grip to take control of the fight.</p>
<p>Eventually Matilda realised that a grip wasn't necessary, she just needed to weigh Tara down. When Tara tried to kneel up, Matilda just threw her whole weight at her, her body pressed against Tara's and pinned her down until her shoulders touched the floor.</p>
<p>"First fight goes to Matilda!" Marcus announced as the two sticky naked women left the pool to make way for Gwen and Juliette.</p>
<p>Gwen and Juliette's bout was over in an instant, Gwen was younger, fitter, and more flexible than Juliette. The moment Marcus yelled for the contest to begin, she slid around Juliette's legs, then in the ensuing fall turned Juliette over and sloppily pinned her shoulders to the mat.</p>
<p>"Now it's time for the third place bout." Marcus announced. Tara re-entered the paddling pool as Juliette got back up to her feet, ready to go again in another round. In the moment to catch their breath, both women feared losing so badly that they had an idea. Tara decided to start the fight squatting low like a sumo wrestler, while Juliette decided to start the fight by throwing a handful of jelly into Tara's face.</p>
<p>"You bitch!" Tara yelled as Juliette charged her down, but as she made contact, Tara's strong stance did the trick and Juliette seemed to bounce off Tara's torso, her jiggling tits the one sign of the hit. Noticing her sudden advantage, Tara simply fell forward onto the wiggling wet body still recovering from the hit. There were some appeals that Tara hadn't completely pinned Juliette to the ground, but Juliette eventually conceded, giving Tara a playful kiss as she squished out of the ring.</p>
<p>"Next up, the grand finale, Matilda Vs Gwen." Marcus announced as they took their positions, both had been watching the previous bout and opted to start crouched like a sumo wrestler. As Marcus signalled the start, both women waited for a moment to see what the other would do.</p>
<p>Matilda sensed that they would be there forever if she didn't do something and lurched at Gwen, who twisted around Matilda allowing her to fall face first into the jelly while Gwen tumbled to one side. Gwen tried to twist around to take advantage of the situation but Matilda had recovered faster (she had gotten used to carrying on through harsh conditions recently) so when Gwen blindly lunged back towards her competition, Matilda was ready and grabbed her, twisting and getting ready to pin her to the ground. Gwen thought fast and decided she wasn't going to overpower Matilda, so she would have to do something a bit cheeky.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Matilda yelled as Gwen reached around her back and pulled apart her butt cheeks. The gasps and laughter from the audience seeing Matilda opened up for them pierced through Matilda, and as she reached behind to cover herself, Gwen used the distraction to push her over, pinning her shoulders to the ground.</p>
<p>"Dirty trick but effective." Marcus announced, raising Gwen's hands in triumph as Matilda glared daggers.</p>
<p>The competitors were allowed to jump in the pool to rinse off the sticky jelly clinging to their bodies. As they were led away to the gazebo for the next event, two men entered the jelly paddling pool to settle a contest of their own as the party continued to degenerate around the contest.</p>
<p>"The next game is a simple challenge, who has the best tits." Marcus announced as everyone gathered back in the gazebo. "Each challenger will have thirty seconds to tell the audience why they have the best tits, then we'll settle things with a classic cheer for the winner. Let's have them speak in order of their current position shall we?"</p>
<p>Marcus beckoned Gwen over and symbolically gave her the stage. Gwen stared out over the audience and back to her competitors, trying desperately to cling on to any errant thought surviving the rush of humiliation, was she really expected to talk about her tits to this audience.</p>
<p>"20 seconds." Marcus shouted over the silence, spurring Gwen into action.</p>
<p>"Right, so my breasts may not be the biggest in the lineup, but they are part of a complete package. I am lithe and flexible, able to make your dreams come true in the bedroom. My bustier opponents wouldn't be able to do that. Plus look at these perfect perky nipples..."</p>
<p>"Time!" Marcus yelled, escorting Gwen away. The audience didn't seem too convinced but they had sympathy considering what she was working with. Marcus then called Matilda to the stage.</p>
<p>"My tits are the best because they have the perfect ratio of nipple area to breast volume, breast size to torso orientation, and minimal drooping. Their teardrop shape is indicative that they are natural, but their bust point is higher than average leading to a more appealing and, dare I say, perky disposition. If you look at the angles..."</p>
<p>"Time!" Marcus yelled, wiping a tear of laughter from his eye. Barnaby cheered on his wife like she had just given the Gettysburg address, but the rest of the audience had found her awkward academic breakdown to be hilarious. Tara was next onto the stage.</p>
<p>"Alright men, this one is obvious, look at these mammoth tits." She announced, appetisingly groping herself for the crowd. "Mine are the biggest by far, just imagine being smothered in these huge boobs. Imagine nuzzling into them, or watching them bounce as you fuck me."</p>
<p>Tara bounced on stage and the audience practically rioted to get a better view.</p>
<p>"These humongous tits are my greatest pride and clearly the winners." She announced, not even waiting for Marcus to call time as she returned to her competitors. Next Marcus called upon Juliette.</p>
<p>"So clearly this is between me and Tara, and yes her tits are bigger, but look at those udders. Sorry girl but they're starting to droop. The next biggest are mine and they are the full package: firm, a perfect handful, perky while still having enough to them that you could fit a cock between them and be cumming on my face within the minute." Juliette asserted. Her tits were about the same size as Matildas, but by stating the terms of the contest as between her and Juliette, she had created the battle lines and it helped her a lot in the audience vote.</p>
<p>Gwen came last, she had some fans among those not into large breasts, but they were not a large enough part of the audience to make her a serious contender. Matilda came next, her academic essay turning off pretty much everyone but Barnaby. Juliette's cunning linguistics got her a lot of support, but she couldn't talk her way into first, and Tara's almighty bust was clearly the favourite.</p>
<p>"So going into the final event it is still all to play for." Marcus announced to the audience. "Tara is currently in the lead with 4 points, then it's Matilda and Gwen both on 3, then Juliette lags behind on 2. And just to be clear, joint winners share the prize, joint losers share the punishment."</p>
<p>The contestants nervously looked at each other as they awaited the final task. Marcus didn't lead them anywhere new, instead he picked four men to join them on stage.</p>
<p>"So we're going to play musical statues, with a twist. When the music stops you freeze, first to move loses. However there's two changes here: one, it will be losers stay on while the winners get to drop out and watch the spectacle unfold; two, each round you will have a man assigned to do whatever it takes to make you move as long as they don't physically move you themselves."</p>
<p>The men smiled in a way that was cheeky and malicious as Marcus walked over to the sound system to start the music. Then he had an idea and walked back to the front of the gazebo.</p>
<p>"Just to make sure none of you do boring safe dancing while the music is playing, there will be a bonus point to the best dancer." Marcus announced before returning to the sound system and pressing play.</p>
<p>The contestants startled themselves into a dance, the crowd cheering on the already humiliating prospect of flaunting their nudity on stage. Gwen decided to show off her flexibility, she bent and twisted but always made sure to keep at least two limbs on the ground ready for the music to stop. Matilda was useless at dancing, her brain scoured tribal rituals, ballroom steps and even historical trends like the Charleston but in the end she decided she was never really the dancing type, so she calculated that it wasn't worth chasing the bonus points and played it safe. Tara knew to use her chest as her biggest asset, so although her legs didn't move much, she would wiggle her hips and run her hands through her hair as she bounced as alluringly as she could. Juliette decided to go unhinged at her dance, she threw herself into it with pure energy and mania, thrashing and flinging herself around the stage like a woman possessed.</p>
<p>Then Marcus stopped the music.</p>
<p>Gwen immediately regretted her position, the music had stopped with her in the middle of getting up after doing the splits, leant forward in a planking position. The man assigned to her malevolently moved in and began tickling her sides. Matilda had planted her feet with her arms by her sides, she could stand like that forever, even when her assigned disruptor decided his best course of action was heavily groping her breasts and bottom. Tara found herself mid squat, her pussy vulnerable, but ignored by her designated distractor who only wanted to grope, fondle, and suck her tits. Juliette had been in mid air when the music stopped and managed to stick a strong landing, but with her arms wide, providing a perfect target for her tickle minded disruptor.</p>
<p>Gwen fell first, she was in a stress position so didn't need much sabotage. Tara was next, the man sucked a bit too hard on her nipples and she ended up shrieking in pain and pushing him off.</p>
<p>Matilda was deep in her happy place when she heard a moan from across the stage. Juliette hadn't found the tickling the regular garden variety distracting, instead it was her sexual weakness and was turning her on. As the man traced her body, she got more and more carried away until, in a wave of humiliating awareness, she had to push the man off of her before her body reacted too strongly. Matilda was lauded as the winner of round 1 and was allowed to retire as Gwen, Tara and Juliette returned to the gazebo.</p>
<p>The music began again, with the women continuing with their previous dance styles, although Juliette tried to catch her heavy breathing and calm down a bit. As they danced, new men were picked from the audience and lined up ready to torment their allocated contestant. Then the music stopped and their malice began.</p>
<p>Gwen was in a much better position this time around, sensing that the music would stop shortly after the tormentors had been chosen, she decided to do a handstand, then fall to writhe on the floor. This meant that she wasn't in a stress position like last time and no longer had to worry about falling to muscle fatigue. Her designated distractor wasn't quite sure how to handle the situation and resorted to tickling her best as he could.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tara had not learned her lesson from last time. The music had stopped just as she was alluringly leaning forward, cupping her breasts for the crowd, a pose best done with her legs apart. Her tormentor had been incensed that his predecessor had left this open goal unscored and wasted no time running his finger across her exposed pussy.</p>
<p>Juliette had paused in a more comfortable position, pretty much standing upright, the only complication being her hands high in the air so they couldn't provide cover to her body as her tormentor picked up where the last one had finished off, tracing her body with the tips of his fingers and once again pouring fuel onto Juliette's desire. After less than a minute, Juliette was the first to lose, not from flinching or pushing the man away, but because when he got face to face with her and traced his hand around her bottom, she had wrapped her arms around him and pulled his face to hers in a naked display of ravenous need.</p>
<p>"Oy!" Tara yelled shortly afterwards. The man had stopped teasing the outside of her pussy and had probed inwards, in shock she had pushed him away, but the reaction of the crowd made it clear that this would not be the end of her troubles. Gwen was ushered safely to one side and new tormentors were picked as Juliette and Tara were once again urged to dance for the crowd.</p>
<p>Juliette knew she had lost, this was it for her, but she also knew if she beat Tara and danced her heart out, she could at least not be alone at the sundae bar. She put as much energy as she could into her frantic dance moves, but she only had a moment to impress as everyone was eager to find out who would lose and Marcus felt that so he stopped the music pretty much immediately. Both women were in a similar position, stood up with arms at off angles, not dancing long enough to break out of their range. Both had their legs far enough apart that their tormentors agreed that's where they would start.</p>
<p>Tara immediately felt her most intimate areas once again being invaded by the audience member's finger. Juliette soon followed with her wet pussy providing no resistance as the man began to finger her.</p>
<p>Tara bit her lip as her humiliation gave way to enjoyment, forced out of her through manual stimulation meeting up with the chemical cocktail or horniness still rampaging through her bloodstream. It also didn't help that Juliette immediately began moaning in pure delight. Marcus noticed Juliette shuffle her feet a bit wider but decided to bend the rules for the sake of the show.</p>
<p>Soon both contestants were moaning in unison as they were fingered in front of the crowd. Desperately trying to hold still as waves of orgasms shocked their bodies for all to see.</p>
<p>"Fuck it!" Juliette yelled, whipping around and grabbing her tormentors erection down his trousers, planting a series of kisses on him and begging him to fuck her.</p>
<p>Marcus dragged her away so he could announce the results of the contest.</p>
<p>"First things first, who was the best dancer?" He asked the crowd. There was a scattering of cheers as names clashed in the audience, but the general consensus was that Gwen was the audience favourite.</p>
<p>"Well that makes things interesting, it means there are 2 queens of the party, both with 6 points, Gwen and Matilda!" Marcus announced. Matilda and Gwen were more interested in where to find some clothes, but they nonetheless smiled and waved to the crowd as they cheered for their champions.</p>
<p>"And in dead last, with a mere 2 points. It's Juliette." Marcus announced. Juliette was still trying to convince her last tormentor to fuck her when Marcus and a couple of his buddies dragged her off to be tied to the Sundae bar.</p>
<p>How Barnaby Watford left the party.</p>
<p>"Is this real?" I asked myself for the hundredth time as I walked hand in hand with my naked wife, her being crowned queen of the party in a perverted game I had supported her in the whole way. She let go of my hand to talk to some people, then to talk to some more people, then to talk to a growing crowd of people who seemed to swirl together into a grey mass that I could only identify as "them."</p>
<p>I don't know why I had thoroughly enjoyed this night but I had. Of course you could blame the drugs but I had enough time tripping to know what I could ascribe to a chemical imbalance and what I could ascribe to me. I'm sure I would have been more shocked sober, but I feel like if I hadn't been OK with the events that unfolded, I would have said so even while high.</p>
<p>I think it's just that my wife and I connected, we bonded, we walked through the fire together and had been purified by the process. I had gotten everything I needed out of this party, although I couldn't remember what I had wanted when I first arrived.</p>
<p>I tried to ponder that for a moment but somehow ended up thinking of frogs.</p>
<p>My wife interrupted my pondering by thrusting Gwen to my side.</p>
<p>"Barnaby, give Gwen your jacket." She ordered. I immediately complied, Gwen had been nice to me, I don't know why it hadn't been obvious that I should have offered her my jacket. I decided to be nice now.</p>
<p>"You want me to book you a taxi home. We can ride with you to make sure the taxi driver doesn't get up to any funny business." I offered.</p>
<p>"Good idea Barnaby." Matilda replied. God she's a great woman. "But I'm afraid I won't be able to come with you. I'm hired for the night and I have been neglecting my duties. It's remarkably lucky I haven't been fired yet."</p>
<p>"Oh, do you need help?"</p>
<p>"No, in fact I think you're right to be taking Gwen home. I feel like if I really want to embed the lessons I learned tonight, I can't have my wealthy husband protecting me. This is a life the working classes can't just leave, so I won't be leaving." Matilda explained.</p>
<p>"Alright then, I'll make sure this young lady gets home safely." I replied, leading her to the taxi rank and back home.</p>
<p>How Gwen McDonald left the party.</p>
<p>Do you know how weird it is doing administration while naked as an already wild party gets even wilder around you.</p>
<p>Whole sections of the party were stripping down for skinny dipping or doing increasingly outrageous forfeits for losing puerile games, and I was stuck giving my work's contact details to stuffy businessmen and Barnaby's wife so she could push him to make contact for partnership investment when he wasn't ribbiting and giggling to himself. Then Marcus asked for my email address so he could send me a spa package because of my last minute surge to win his stupid contest.</p>
<p>Eventually I had to cut through all this bullshit with my one and only desire for some time.</p>
<p>"Can I have some clothes and money for a taxi?" I yelled above the din, now that my missions had been accomplished.</p>

<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>"Oh yes, of course." Marcus interjected. My lovely wife actually has your clutch stashed away in her room, I'll go get it for you."</p>
<p>"And my clothes?" I asked impatiently.</p>
<p>"Long gone I'm afraid." Marcus replied.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I'll get Barnaby to give you his." Matilda reassured, dragging me away from the din.</p>
<p>I have to hand it to Matilda, she did marry a gentleman. Even on whatever drug still scrambled his brain, he gave me his jacket, didn't get fresh with me in the taxi and made sure the taxi driver didn't do anything either. He was somehow still the most boring man on the planet but I'd take boring in this situation over someone like Marcus trying to make things more interesting. He even let me keep his jacket for the run from the taxi to my apartment.</p>
<p>The following Monday, Clare was thrilled with my party performance. The farm owner consortium had contacted her on Sunday to offer a very lucrative contract, while Barnaby had made contact at 9:00am on the dot to discuss the possibility of partnership with an investment that would keep the lights on and an expertise that would help the organisation flourish beyond some meatpackers trying not to lose too much money every time a worker lost an arm.</p>
<p>"How would you like to go to more social events in the future?" She asked me. I paused, and then I don't know what came over me, but all I could think to respond was.</p>
<p>"Sign me up!"</p>
<p>How Matilda Watford left the party.</p>
<p>Contact details, arrangements, Cashday payment limits, spa day availabilities. I was in the swirl of what were definitively middle class worries as I wondered what to do next. I was good at this sort of thing. So was my husband but he was in no state to handle the admin so I took care of it. I realised that even naked, I was now in my comfort zone of professional liaison, and that was a bad thing.</p>
<p>It was about midnight and my shift didn't end until 6am. After everything that had happened I could just go, I had earned everyone money and I'm sure Meagan was reasonable enough that she wouldn't fire me.</p>
<p>Then I remembered my discussions with Mercedes about law and order, how people were "reasonable and flexible" with me because of my class, race, and upbringing. If someone less privileged than me walked off of the job, their manager would fire them. It was an uncomfortable truth but I had been spending a lot of time learning those recently. So I placed Gwen in a taxi with Barnaby, then I got back to work cleaning up empty glasses and offering people drinks from the bar.</p>
<p>The guests at the party continued where they had left off, but with a renewed sense of boundaries removed by the contest I had just won. At first offers of cash for graffiti started rolling in again, I stayed at $50 for each go with the Sharpie, and within no time I was covered with more penises than I could count, a variety of insulting words on every inch of my skin, and even "cocksucker" written across my forehead and two large cocks on my cheeks pointing towards my mouth.</p>
<p>Once people got bored of desecrating my skin, the darkest minds got together to try and figure out what else they could pay me for. I firmly drew the line that sex acts were off the table, justifying the red line by thinking to myself that those without privilege don't get leniency by the police if caught in prostitution.</p>
<p>One man said he would pay me $50 to shave my pussy. My pubic hair had already been kept neatly trimmed so that it wouldn't poke out of my golden bikini, so I didn't see it as much of a sacrifice when I agreed and the man rushed to the toilet to pick out a manscaping kit they had spotted there earlier.</p>
<p>It was a strange feeling, the trimmers buzzing against my pubis, before lathering up my nethers with some shaving cream and gliding a razer around my pussy, all the while being watched by a party of men, cheering as my bald labia were revealed in all their unconcealed glory. I ran my hand over my smooth pussy and it felt alien, another part of my new life so different to the old that I would describe it with an other-worldly metaphor.</p>
<p>There were whispers and chuckles among the men who had been watching my show, they obviously had something on their mind but were keeping their voices hushed. I could have sworn I heard one of them mention Wolf of Wall Street but I didn't get the connection. Then one of the men downed his drink and stepped forward to deliver the offer.</p>
<p>"We've pooled our money. We will give you $1000 if you shave your head." He announced.</p>
<p>"What!" I unguardedly replied, but he didn't feel the need to elaborate, he simply stood with a grin on his face awaiting my answer.</p>
<p>I knew from various studies the historical significance of ritualistic head shaving, it was inherently a dehumanising act, designed to mark its subject as aside from human society. The Buddhist monks shave their heads to renounce their earthly attachment to ego, while Nazi collaborators were often shaved by their communities after the war to mark them for ostracisation. Pertinent to Marxist theory, the shaving of hair was always related to the removal of power, like Samson in the bible or ancient Greek slaves.</p>
<p>What this man was requesting was that for a minute fraction of his economic power, I surrender powers that were assumed as a part of fundamental humanity. He was asking for my dignity, to surrender my ego, to mark myself as instantly recognisable as a subservient being even beyond the end of the party. While in a privileged position I could never have dreamed that some people are often faced with decisions between survival and their fundamental humanity, and yet effectively such a decision was being put to me right now. I nervously curled a strand of my dirty blonde hair around my finger, deep down I knew I was saying goodbye. Then I agreed.</p>
<p>At first they tried using the clippers directly, but they were designed for unruly body hair, not a full head of hair so they kept whirring to a stop, my hair fighting back and clogging up its attacker. So one of the men ran to the kitchen and got a set of kitchen scissors. I sat completely still as the relentless snipping lightened the top of my head, occasionally I would see a clump of my hair fall to the floor and do my best to hold back my sobs of humiliation. Soon all that remained was a messy thatch of short brown hair, the roots that the bleach hadn't reached months ago when my fashionable hairstyle was so important. Then the body hair trimmer whirred to life with far more success.</p>
<p>They gave me a moment to run my hand over my head, it felt like stubble, like Barnaby's face when he pulled a few all-nighters on some legal case. I let a tear run down my cheek as I felt shaving cream being smeared over my head.</p>
<p>Once the razer had done its job, I couldn't help but run my hands over my head and pussy at the same time. Now they were smooth, bald, pure uninterrupted skin. The men cheered at the conquering of one already so far below them in status, it was economic sadism, like cheering in triumph at beating a child in an arm wrestle.</p>
<p>"Well, look at the good news." One man observed. "Not only have you earned $1000, you also now have more room for people to write on you, and I believe you were charging $50 a pop for that."</p>
<p>The man took out his phone, showed me $50 going into my Cashday app, then took out a pen and drew a cock over my recently shaved head.</p>
<p>Usually at the end of a hard work day, I go home and leave all my feelings at work. I learned how to create boundary schemas in my occupational psychology courses. But that is much harder when you step into a taxi with a freshly shaved head and all manner of horrible phrases written over it. I had lost my bikini and knew I'd end up having to pay for a new one but my outside clothes were still in the bag I had tucked them away in. My coat covered most of what wasn't covered by my blouse and jeans, but the bottom of my calves still showed graffiti, leaving the taxi driver in no doubt that my horrible labelling was ubiquitous.</p>
<p>It was early morning when my shift ended. The taxi driver was a gentleman, not mentioning my obvious degraded state, but I still spent the journey re-living my night of naked and humiliating subservience over and over again in my head.</p>
<p>When I got home, I stripped down and spent a good few hours examining my reflection in the mirror. It was pretty distressing to see so raw and fresh from the experience, but my desecrated body was a reminder of the brutality of greed and power. I decided to skip class that day so I could rest.</p>
<p>When I was next at work I showed Meagan my Cashday app, by my new standard it was an almighty payday. With the tips coming in, the head shave and competition bonuses, all added up it came to $3142.50. I transferred the whole amount to my boss so she could put all the tips into the pot and evenly divide them.</p>
<p>As I was the last holdout, I heard back from my boss pretty quickly about my cut. It had been a good night for everyone so we all ended up taking home over a thousand dollars each. I was still gawking at my banking app as my balance jumped up, thinking about the breathing space this bought me, no more overtime, no more going hungry just before payday, hell the tips mixed with my salary was enough to pay my rent until graduation.</p>
<p>"So I'm guessing I won't see you till next Friday?" My boss asked. Immediately I was filled with a sense of remorse, I had earned my way out of the lesson I was learning. It didn't feel right. I quickly pulled up the details ofTransLegal, the charity that the party had been in aid of, and transferred the entire amount to them.</p>
<p>"Actually I had some unexpected debts, so I'm still going to need to pull some extra shifts." I lied.</p>
<p>In all my academic career I have never been as proud of an achievement as just scraping Salutatorian at Rindlebrook Community College. My dissertation on sexuality and class was originally heavily marked down and described as obscene by my professor, but on appeal I managed to get a new marker who was more on board with my way of thinking. It was the day after I got my degree that I drove out to Erotes Spa and Thermal Baths in the isolated hills outside of town. I had agreed to give Gwen a lift as we both had tickets courtesy of Marcus. My hair had begun to grow back but still looked barely more than a buzz cut.</p>
<p>"So while Barnaby gets settled into his new role at Blackmore, Jones &amp; Watford, I thought I would have one last self-indulgent university course or apprenticeship or something of that nature." I explained among the idle chit chat to cover our embarrassment at the memory of how we earned a spa day. "Just until he's ready to join me in my interests. I can't show my face around our circles until my hair is at least at a pixie cut anyway. I've got to say yours looks pretty cute, maybe I should dye mine an interesting colour too."</p>
<p>We pulled up to a cluster of cabins, telltale plumes of steam rising from the various thermal baths, saunas, and treatments contained within. There was a big modern cabim with a smattering of cars parked outside so we figured that was the place to park and enter. Inside there was a perky woman behind a desk who took our names and explained what had been paid for.</p>
<p>"So you have been bought the silver package. This means you have the run of all our self-serve facilities: sauna, steam room, thermal baths, jacuzzis and the aromatherapy oils. You will need to pay if you want a locker but there's never really been a problem with people leaving their clothes and towels on the benches in the changing room."</p>
<p>"We'll probably pay for one anyway." I responded, "it's not like I have waterproof pockets for my phone and purse in my swimming costume."</p>
<p>"Oh, did you not know?" The receptionist awkwardly responded, "Erotes Spa is strictly no coverings beyond the changing room."</p>
<p>Gwen and I could practically hear Marcus chuckling at our realisation.</p>
<p>"I thought you would have known, after all the silver package also comes with a massage complete with happy ending." She informed. Gwen immediately stormed back to the car in a huff leaving me to deal with this fallout.</p>
<p>"Clearly she's not into that, would I be able to come back tomorrow on my own?" I asked the receptionist. She agreed and with a few taps on the keyboard was able to rebook me.</p>
<p>"As you're rebooking, I'll offer you a special deal on the gold package, with this package you get a personal spa attendant to follow you on your wellbeing journey. Anything you ask of her, anything at all, and she has to agree." She explained. I politely declined and stuck to my silver package, however on the way out of the door I couldn't help but double back and ask one final question.</p>
<p>"Do you do apprenticeships?"</p>
<p>How Tara Tilly left the party</p>
<p>I don't think I had stopped breathing a sigh of relief since Juliette crumbled at the final hurdle. As I watched her being dragged off and tied up to the table next to the sundae bar, I felt an arm wrap around my waist and turned to see Marcus' next to me.</p>
<p>"So... want to continue where we left off?" He asked. In any other state this would be the time for me to cut my losses, head home, and let my dildo finish off any frustrations I had about the evening. But I was just too fucking horny. I had been on the edge ever since the married man had failed to bring me to orgasm even with chemical help, and now I was fresh from an intense fingering in front of an audience, my body wracked by the most humiliating orgasms but still wanting more.</p>
<p>"I need a cock in me as soon as possible." I splurged, grabbing Marcus by the lapel and dragging him into the house to find a room.</p>
<p>I looked around, before realising that I hadn't exactly gotten the lay of the house since arriving, I didn't know what I was expecting to find, a sign saying 'this way to the fuck rooms!'</p>
<p>"Fuck it, we're having sex here." I told Marcus as I began to strip him down in the living room. As I liberated his cock from his trousers, it had clearly been rock hard a long time. I gave it a kiss, a quick tonsil tickle to make sure he was ready and to get a bit of lubricant on it before he fucked my pussy. I couldn't believe it when that was all it took to push him over the edge and he immediately came down my throat.</p>
<p>Fucking married men.</p>
<p>So now I was right back where I started, horny as hell and my possible outlet now giving me a half apology as he collapsed onto a nearby sofa, spent.</p>
<p>"Oy, one pump chump. Please tell me you have sex toys in your house." I demanded, giving him a frustrated tap on the arm.</p>
<p>"Afraid not."</p>
<p>"Fucks sake. Right, I'm going to go and sit on your wife's face."</p>
<p>How Juliette Selassie left the party</p>
<p>I was surprised how calm I was as my arms were seized and I was dragged towards the sundae bar. Moments earlier I had been begging to be fucked and that hadn't changed, so I was actually thrilled to see a wall of malicious lust watching me as I was laid on a table, my wrists and ankles tied into the far corners by rope that was not yeilding with any of my movements.</p>
<p>Then I felt the freezing cold ice cream being deliberately scooped onto my nipples. Soon the party was treating my body as a canvas for their sticky sundae ideas. I had lines of whipped cream squirted down my body, stick syrup drizzled on my exposure, all the while, more and more ice cream continued to drive my already prickling skin into sensory overdrive.</p>
<p>Then the first tongue lapped at my body. That broke the dam and soon every part of me was being licked. Well every part except one. My desperate pussy remained untouched and the frustration was killing me.</p>
<p>I was wondering how long the party would be restrained, when suddenly I turned my head to follow a commotion and saw Tara making a beeline for me.</p>
<p>"I don't usually do this, but I need someone I know isn't a married man." She announced. I didn't know what she was referring to, but it became quickly apparent as she climbed onto the table, squatted with her knees either side of my head, then forced her pussy onto my mouth.</p>
<p>'Finally somebody gets it.' I thought to myself as I opened my mouth and started greedily licking. I couldn't believe how quickly and violently she began moaning and grinding her pussy against my face. I simply flowed with the moment and kept driving as deep as I could while the gathered men took this as an opportunity to cover us both with sweet ice cream toppings for them to lick off. Soon I felt her legs clamp against my head and she squeezed tight as I brought her to the mother of all orgasms.</p>
<p>As she climbed off there was a queue of men next to her, waiting for their turn to have sticky oral sex.</p>
<p>The angles for someone tied to the middle of a table aren't quite right for sucking a cock. The first man found that out the hard way as he had to shuffle around to get the angle right, eventually kneeling around my head and facing the other way so his cock could slide down my throat. This quickly grew into a movement to tie me up differently to make blow jobs easier. It was Marcus that then made the suggestion I had been thinking but not saying.</p>
<p>"Bend her over the table, that way not only can you fuck her face, you can also fuck her pussy if you want.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, I was rearranged and my cold sticky body was forced into the table, while my wrists and ankles were now tied to the base of the table legs to force me to bend over. It was gross and uncomfortable, but all my reservations were forgotten when I felt that first cock pressing itself against my pussy, my wetness offering no resistance as it parted my labia and began pounding inside of me.</p>
<p>My mouth let out a gurgling moan of pure contentment around a man's penis as I finally got ravished as I had wanted. My body violated from both angles, and my pussy finally fucked like I had been desperate for since first I stepped into this party and began my vicarious thrills through the other guests I corrupted.</p>
<p>As one man surged inside of me, his cock flopped out only to be instantly replaced by another one. Marcus had stocked up on condoms for this party and none of the men were OK fucking around leftover cum so those fucking my pussy had all wrapped themselves.</p>
<p>The first shot of cum down my throat reminded me that none of those getting blow jobs were taking such a precaution, and I was due to swallow a lot of cum tonight.</p>
<p>"Hundred bucks to tie you to a table like that." A man out of the corner of my eye asked. I turned to face him and I couldn't believe the state Matilda was now in, totally shaved, men still using her skin like a schoolboy's desk.</p>
<p>"No payment for sex. I'm not a whore like her." Matilda replied. I couldn't believe it. She was looking down on me. She had been reduced to a degraded servile piece of meat and somehow I was of a lower status than her.</p>
<p>"How about a hundred bucks to go spank her ass?" The man countered, and to my shock Matilda agreed. She waited until my most recent cock diner was done, then let loose a series of swats on my unprotected bottom, I screamed as best as I could but the man fucking my face was clearly enjoying the whole scenario and came hard into my mouth.</p>
<p>Eventually, my bottom now glowing raw, Matilda retreated to allow me to go back to fucking my pussy. All the while, I was subject to negotiations from men trying to see what it would cost to get Matilda to lower herself to my level. I was the base unit of degradation, the sluttiest whore at the party, how could anyone lower themselves to the level I was at?</p>
<p>"Alright I get it, in which case I'm just going to fuck this slut. How much for you to stick around and encourage me, even moan a little, so I can imagine I'm fucking you?" He asked Matilda, I was now such a piece of fuckmeat that men needed someone else to make them aroused while they fucked me. Matilda gave the man a cheeky grin as she gave up her idea.</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>"For $200, I will sit on her back and masturbate while you fuck her." She offered. I started to wonder why she was sticking to this no sex line she clearly wanted to cross so badly, but I wasn't able to wonder for long as I was quickly distracted by the next man moving in to fuck my face.</p>
<p>It was some time before I felt the pressure of Matilda climbing onto the table and moving herself into position to sit on my back. Her bottom began grinding itself against me as she began to moan in unison with the latest man fucking my pussy. I couldn't believe it but it was clear that Matilda was having an orgasm before the man was even close. I even felt her leaning forward to give the man a kiss, encouraging him to plough me harder. Then as he began to grunt she suddenly and without warning yelled.</p>
<p>"$50 and you can cum on my tits."</p>
<p>"How about $100 to cum on your head?"</p>
<p>"Fuck yeah" she screamed and I felt her lean forward just as the man pulled out. I didn't see what happened, but I heard the crowd's reaction and felt a trickle of cum drip off Matilda as she moaned with one more orgasm. Then she got very self-conscious and ran away, once again leaving me the target of swirling sexuality.</p>
<p>Gradually the sun began to rise over the horizon as the gaps between my lovers got longer and I went from a party game to part of the furniture. Some guys snorted some lines of drugs off my ass at one point but in general I was just there to be looked at and pitied in my post-violation stupor. As the last pockets of party animals left the house, Marcus untied me and let me go to the shower upstairs to get cleaned up. When I got out of the shower, my red dress was left waiting for me on a nearby chair.</p>
<p>Marcus and Juliette had a short talk about their relationship before falling asleep on their respective sofas. Once they woke up they poured themselves a large strong coffee and had a more detailed discussion of their relationship.</p>
<p>They agreed that monogamy had ceased to be the deal-breaker it once was. They agreed that last night they had not just re-lived their wild days, they had gone far beyond that and had enjoyed themselves. They agreed that if they didn't do something drastic, they would continue on this trajectory and end up self-destructing. They also realised that what had kept them from self-destructing years ago was that same boring responsibility to each other that had led to their breakup in the first place.</p>
<p>Marcus suggested they have an on and off relationship, so they could live their wild lives then come back to normality, only for Juliette to tell him how fucking stupid that idea was. She wanted to share the wild times with him, not spend every moment resenting her partner for keeping her safe, like he's an OSHA handbook.</p>
<p>Juliette proposed that their parties become a part of their relationship. That at any one time on the horizon there was a party they were organising, they would need funds and support for their plans, so they would rely on each other to pour themselves into the celebrations. Juliette even suggested the four dates they would have parties on: the anniversary of their first date, the anniversary of their first fuck, their wedding anniversary, and the anniversary of the party that brought them back together, all significant dates for both of them so that if they broke up they would know the party was cancelled. They would provide each other this release they clearly needed, but would also keep each other from indulging it too much.</p>
<p>"In that case I guess we have another party to organise." Marcus announced as he agreed to Juliette's proposal. "We only have a couple of months until the first time we fucked."</p>
<p>"Glad you remember." Juliette replied.</p>
<p>"So, seeing as I did most of the work planning the last party, how about you take the lead on this one, what were you thinking?" Marcus asked.</p>
<p>"I've had an idea, but we're going to need a petting zoo, a shit ton of bubble wrap, and a naval captain willing to do house calls."</p>
<p>"I'll draw up a guest list, I know the first 4 people we're inviting."</p>
