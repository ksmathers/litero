<p>[Hey there Literotites. First time, long time. This one turned out a little longer than intended (ha ha), but I'm happy with how it ended up. If you like masturbation, voyeurism, incest, anal, loving wives(girlfriends, really), oral, girl/girl, reluctance, or group sex, there's something here for you. If you don't like those things...well...I don't know what to tell you.</p>
<p>I put this in the Incest/Taboo category because, in the end, it is a story about a brother and sister.</p>
<p>Everyone here is over 18.</p>
<p>Good times.]</p>
<p>"That sure is a lot of condoms, Sam," I said.</p>
<p>I stood as far back from my friend as I could.</p>
<p>Sam just reached into the box for another handful and tossed it into our cart—already filled with Gatorade, salted nuts, and granola bars. Everything two growing boys needed for a 'promising' weekend on my parents' yacht.</p>
<p>"It's going down, I can feel it," Sam said.</p>
<p>"You have a girlfriend. How much shit is really 'going down,' man?"</p>
<p>Sam snorted.</p>
<p>"Kate's cool," he said.</p>
<p>I've known Kate since high school. One thing I know for certain is that she was not 'cool.'</p>
<p>Sam had told me stuff, too. Kate wasn't exactly...enthusiastic in bed. It had taken almost a year of dating for her to go further than a tentative hand job. And everything was with a condom. Everything.</p>
<p>No cumming inside her. You sheathed your dick and you did your little back and forth. Then, long before anything might happen, you pulled out. And since nothing was going in her, nothing was going on her either. Your...efforts were to be deposited into the condom. The end.</p>
<p>Once, Sam told me, he had accidentally spilled a bit of sperm on her stomach—her stomach!—and Kate had freaked for weeks. This was not a girl who was 'cool.' This was a girl who was having sex for the same reason you curb your dog or clean the litter box. If you want the relationship, you've gotta do some ugly stuff or everything turns into a big smelly mess.</p>
<p>Based on everything he told me, I wasn't sure why Sam was with Kate. Actually, that's a lie. I knew exactly why he was with Kate. It was the same reason I had pined after her for all four years of high school.</p>
<p>Kate was H-O-T hot. Super hot. Tall, big blue eyes, long brown hair that seemed to shimmer in the sunlight, blow job lips (Not that she ever gave blow jobs, but damn, those lips looked like they were made for it. Kate's unwillingness to suck Sam off was like a dude going speed limit in his Porsche), and the pieces-de-résistance: huge gravity-defying tits. Kate was real world gorgeous hot. Which meant she could get away with being a bit of an ice queen. OK, more than a bit. Kinda the queen of the ice queens?</p>
<p>All right, that's not completely fair. But still.</p>
<p>"You getting any?" Sam pointed to the shelf.</p>
<p>"Nahhh. No girlfriend to use em on," I said, feeling a little embarrassed by my current state of singlehood.</p>
<p>"Come on, Jason, you never know," Sam said, "gonna be lots of ass to choose from at this weekend."</p>
<p>"Well, let's see, there's your girlfriend, my sister..."</p>
<p>"There ya go," Sam said.</p>
<p>"I'm not doing my sister," I said.</p>
<p>"But she's bringing a friend, right?"</p>
<p>"Doing my sister's friend is too much like doing my sister," I said.</p>
<p>"Well Kate said she'd be bringing someone so..."</p>
<p>"Didn't you tell me all of Kate's friends were dogs?"</p>
<p>"You don't have to look at the girl, just..."</p>
<p>"No thanks. Just...no thanks," I said.</p>
<p>So I didn't buy condoms. Of course, Sam went ahead and bought enough to keep an entire Olympic Village going at each other for at least several weeks, so maybe I just figured I was in the clear.</p>
<p>Or maybe I was just lying to myself. I'm not sure, to be honest.</p>
<p>Sam and I were first to arrive at the dock. We took the little two-stroke engine motorboat across the bay, and then bivouacked our supplies onto the yacht.</p>
<p>It wasn't the biggest thing the world, but it slept four pretty easily and it wouldn't feel too crowded with six. There was one master bedroom, a smaller bedroom with two bunk beds, a full head (aka, bathroom), a main room with a fold out couch, a little kitchen on the far side of that, and plenty of sitting room above deck, as well.</p>
<p>There was no TV, no Internet, but an absolute ton of alcohol. My sister and I nicknamed the ship the "S.S. Trouble" back when Dad first bought it.</p>
<p>He'd gotten it on a lark, trying to create a way for the family to spend more time with each other. It had kinda worked. I mean, my sister was joining us so...</p>
<p>The first to text us for a lift was Kate and her friend, a girl I hadn't met before. Sam, being the boyfriend, won the right to ferry the girls back to the boat. I was organizing plates and glasses, not really paying attention, when the three of them came below deck.</p>
<p>There was a loud bang, like someone dropping a large amount of luggage. Kate and Sam were already bickering, Kate's friend stood off to the side, looking anxious.</p>
<p>"Where are we sleeping?" Kate asked.</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>"I dunno. Wherever, I guess."</p>
<p>"Really Jason? We're gonna just sleep on the floor like fucking animals?" Kate shouted. Her friend seemed to step back even further.</p>
<p>I raised my hands in surrender.</p>
<p>"I just...didn't plan anything 's all. Just...I dunno, take my parents room."</p>
<p>Kate made a "urrgh"—a growl of satisfaction and exasperation, then marched past the kitchen to the main cabin. Sam followed, lugging several suitcases—more bellboy than boyfriend.</p>
<p>I looked over at Kate's friend, still cowering in the corner of the living room.</p>
<p>I extended my hand.</p>
<p>"I'm Jason."</p>
<p>"Ashley," she said, smiling slightly.</p>
<p>Ashley's golden hair fell in cute little ringlets around a not-too angular face. Her nose and ears were just a little too big. Everything else on her was tiny—thin little lips, neat agile fingers, bit of a bum just peaking out from under her long, brown sweater. She couldn't be more than 5'1", maybe 5'2" with the right set of shoes.</p>
<p>Really super cute. She was like a mix of the weird artist chick in your freshman dorm and the nice girl who grew up down the street from your childhood home. She made me wish I'd bought condoms. As soon as I let go of her hand, the smile raced off her face. I gestured for her to sit, but she just stood there. Thin, quiet, standing on the side of the room—she was like an attractive, fuck-able lamp.</p>
<p>My phone buzzed, letting me know it was time to get my sister. I told Ashley where I was going. She just nodded, nailed to the floor. If she didn't move soon, I was gonna have to try to return her to IKEA.</p>
<p>My sister Emma gave me an awkward half-kiss half-hug when I arrived. Her friend, Kristen, blonde and beautiful, started picking up boxes and helping me. Em got the hint and helped as well. We were on our way in minutes.</p>
<p>The girls sat at the front while I steered from the rear. They both looked angelic, sitting at the bow, their hair whipping in the wind. Kristen was tall, almost my height, farm girl looks in full display. She had thick blonde hair down to the small of her back. Freckles splashed across her nose and shoulders. She was probably a couple pounds overweight—10 if you believe Cosmo, but I don't. It filled her out nicely, honestly—it added a little extra heft to her boobs and ass. I'd known Kristen since my sister was in middle school. They were both a year younger than me, finishing off high school, getting ready for year one in college. They'd already planned on going to the same school, natch. They were inseparable. Kristen and my sister.</p>
<p>My sister. Yeah. The little brunette leaning back in the boat, eyes closed, soaking up the salt air. She looked even better than I remembered. Her chest a little fuller, her body a little more defined. Em played soccer since forever. She always had her brown hair tied up in a ponytail. Always dressed in a t-shirt and shorts. Guys would tease me that my little sis was more of a dude than me. They wouldn't say that looking at her now.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess it's fair to say my sister was kinda my dream girl. Not my sister sister...I mean, that's just not a good idea. But a girl that looks and acts and is just like my sister. Yeah.</p>
<p>This just had to end well, right?</p>
<p>Yikes.</p>
<p>After a day of travel, no one really felt like doing much. We ate soup I warmed out of a can, we changed into pjs, we called it a night. Not a beer was cracked.</p>
<p>Sam and Kate had already claimed the master bedroom. Emma and Kristen agreed to squeeze into the bunk beds in the other room. That left Ashley on the fold out couch and me in a sleeping bag on the floor nearby.</p>
<p>I noticed Ashley was wearing pink pj pants and a little strappy pink top before she slid under the covers. I was wearing long flannel pants and nothing else. If she felt uncomfortable, she didn't say anything. But, then, I wasn't sure she'd speak if she was sleeping on needles. Quiet little lamp.</p>
<p>The room was almost totally dark. The ocean rolled in the distance. I sighed, contentedly. It was nice to be back on the boat. We were only a few miles off shore, but I was already too far away for my troubles to reach me.</p>
<p>I heard the squeaking first.</p>
<p>Then the hushed voices. They sounded excited, a little upset, maybe even a little angry? Then more squeaking. I couldn't help but look up at Ashley on the couch. She was wide eyed. I couldn't see where her hands were.</p>
<p>Then there was grunting.</p>
<p>Sam's voice. "Oh. Oh yeah. Oh baby. So good."</p>
<p>Over and over. Little grunt from Kate.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah. Come on..." I heard her say.</p>
<p>"Come on..."</p>
<p>I looked over at Ashley again. Her little curls were trembling. Her blanket shifted back and forth. Working herself pretty hardcore there. I reached into my own pants and took hold.</p>
<p>"Oh god..." Sam said.</p>
<p>"Come on, baby..." Kate said.</p>
<p>"So good..." Sam said.</p>
<p>"Come on, baby," Kate pleaded, "get there. Come on, baby. I know you can get there. Come on."</p>
<p>Ashley's squishy sounds were almost as loud as the squeaking bed now. Her breaths were coming in these short, deep little gasps. I was working myself full on, now.</p>
<p>"Ohhhh...almost...," Sam finally exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Pull out baby! Pull out pull out pull out!" Kate cried.</p>
<p>"Oh god, but I'm so close," Sam whined, "I've got the condom on, baby, come on, just this once why can't I..."</p>
<p>"No!" Kate practically shouted. In that moment, my dick dropped limp like the poor little guy had been shot. I looked up and saw Ashley shudder, arms locked at her sides, head tilted back, a little squeaky gasp escaping her mouth.</p>
<p>Guess not everyone is turned off by a bit of arguing.</p>
<p>"Baby, I..."</p>
<p>"Sam. No."</p>
<p>I heard the sound of a shove. The squick squick squick of a hand working a cock. I know the sound. I had just been making it myself.</p>
<p>"Ahhhhhh," I heard Sam reach his climax.</p>
<p>"There you go, baby. Isn't that better? You feel better, baby?" Kate asked.</p>
<p>"Uh huh," Sam said. I heard a click, like a light being turned on. Bright yellow spilled from under the door. I quickly readjusted myself, waiting for someone to come out. Nothing happened. The light clicked back off.</p>
<p>It was dark. All I could hear was the ocean and the sound of Ashley's slight snore. I was blue balled as all get out, but my cock stayed limp. For whatever reason, now that Ashley had finished, I felt a little strange tossing one off with her in the room. At a certain point, I guess I just fell asleep.</p>
<p>The next day, we swam in the ocean, ate whatever, napped, then did it all again. We also opened up the alcohol.</p>
<p>By the time the sun was down we were all pretty good and lubricated. No one was falling down drunk, but we had all discovered a wonderful midpoint between buzzed and blasted. Then Em pulled a joint out of...somewhere?...and we passed that around for a bit, too.</p>
<p>We all sat around the living room, alcohol bottles resting everywhere there was flat space. The ocean sighed. I was in a nice, comfy place.</p>
<p>"See, now this is when a TV would be really super nice," Kate said. Emma just glared over at Kate. My sister had never gotten along with her.</p>
<p>"I think this is nice," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"Me too," I said.</p>
<p>"So what's on for tonight?" Sam asked, maybe a little too anxious?</p>
<p>"I think we can figure something out," Emma said, smirking. She stood up. Still seated, I could almost follow her smooth, muscular legs right up the bottom of her shorts to the promised land. I wasn't the only person looking, either.</p>
<p>Emma practically pranced over to the kitchen. She grabbed an empty wine bottle and brought it back to the circle. Just looking at the bottle, my cock began to grow. Good times.</p>
<p>We'd all gone to high school together, except for Ashley. We'd all played games like this one. Spin to win and all that. It never went much beyond basic cable nudity and a bit of making out. But then, that was high school. With my parents in the next room.</p>
<p>Now four of us were in college and Emma and Kristen were both of age and headed to uni in the fall. And there were no parents here. And we were drunk and high and horny.</p>
<p>"I believe we're all familiar with our little friend here?" Emma asked,</p>
<p>"Except maybe Ashley?"</p>
<p>Ashley nodded pleasantly. My little lamp. Maybe tonight I'd figure out how to switch her on.</p>
<p>Emma was explaining.</p>
<p>"...and then you give them a dare. Anything you like. Preferably something dirty, but, y'know, whatever, really."</p>
<p>Kate shifted, slightly. She was sitting to my right and I felt her stiffen.</p>
<p>"Guys...I dunno. I mean. We've done stuff like this before, but...," Kate said, "now I'm together with Sam and I..."</p>
<p>"You don't have to do anything you don't want to do," Emma said, reassuringly.</p>
<p>"C'mon, babe," Sam said, totally not looking at Kate, "It'll be fun."</p>
<p>"I dunno," she repeated.</p>
<p>"I've got a problem, too," I said. Everyone turned to look at me, confused. I pointed at my sister, Emma.</p>
<p>"What?" Emma asked, "I'm 18, Jay Bird. You're going to have to accept that I'm a grown up woman with grown up woman wants and grown up woman needs."</p>
<p>"No no. That's not... I mean, you want to let a bunch of guys just fuck around with you I'm not gonna stop em," I said.</p>
<p>Then I realized what was coming out of my mouth and stopped myself. "I mean, I care."</p>
<p>"That's my bro!" Emma exclaimed, "so sweet and protective!"</p>
<p>She leaned playfully into Kristen who laughed along with her best friend.</p>
<p>"No! That's not... Look, I'm a little drunk here. And a little high. Just, like, cut me some slack or something, OK?"</p>
<p>"It's fine, bro," Emma giggled, "I'm glad you're so excited about your slutty little sis."</p>
<p>I moaned, exasperated.</p>
<p>"Look, if we're gonna spin the bottle around and do, I dunno, whatever, I'm just... I mean... Like, if it's pointing at Emma I don't want to..."</p>
<p>"So maybe Kate and Emma, like, just don't play," Sam said, "That way no one does anything they don't want to."</p>
<p>"Wait, I have to go hide in the bedroom while everyone else has fun because my brother can't handle what might happen?" Emma snapped.</p>
<p>"And what about you?" Kate rounded on Sam, "You'll just... sit here while I wait for you back in our room?"</p>
<p>Sam's hands shot up in surrender.</p>
<p>"No! I was... It was just... I' m trying to make everyone happy 's all."</p>
<p>"I have a boyfriend, too," Kristen said, quietly, "So I...ummm... I guess I won't play either...?"</p>
<p>The room went silent. I could feel the mood</p>
<p>We all came to the boat knowing we'd do something a little wild. You don't spend all day in skimpy bathing suits, drinking and getting high just to eat a nice meal, have a little chat, and then call it a night. We were in our twenties, not our forties.</p>
<p>Now that the moment had arrived, no one wanted to be the one to start things off. We were drunk, and bored, but we'd talked ourselves into a bit of a corner that no one really wanted to stay in. We just needed an excuse to take advantage of ourselves.</p>
<p>"OK," I said, "Let's change the game a little."</p>
<p>I stood up, taking the wine bottle with me.</p>
<p>"New game," I said.</p>
<p>I rooted around the cabinets.</p>
<p>"This is a deck of cards," I announced, holding up the deck as I walked back to our little circle.</p>
<p>"Wow," Sam said, "you really are full of amazing tricks."</p>
<p>"Ha ha. Now, I'll shuffle the deck and deal each of you a card, face down. High card wins. But before we reveal our cards, each of us can make a bet. Something silly, something dirty, whatever."</p>
<p>"So like, I get a Jack and I say I'll...I dunno...take off my sock if my card isn't the highest?" Emma asked.</p>
<p>"Exactly. If I show a King or whatever, you have to take off your sock. I mean, hopefully it'll be something a little more fun than that. But you get the idea."</p>
<p>"What if I don't like my card?" Kristen asked, "What if I've got a two or something? Do I have to bet?"</p>
<p>"That's the beauty of the game," I said, "if you don't like your card, you can just fold. No harm done. And since you're picking your own bet, you're never doing something you're uncomfortable with."</p>
<p>"What about the winner?" Sam asked, "What does he get?"</p>
<p>"He or she," I said, "is the recipient of the bet. So like, if Ashley bets a kiss and she loses to Kristen, Ash has to kiss her."</p>
<p>Kristen looked a little abashed at my example. Ashley, on the other hand, seemed strangely pleased by the idea.</p>
<p>"Kiss what? Where?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Well, maybe Ashley specifies. Or it can be winner's choice. I dunno. It's just a way to get things going, guys. It's our game, we can always adjust as we go."</p>
<p>"Sounds good to me," Emma said.</p>
<p>"Me too," Kristen said.</p>
<p>Ashley just nodded and smiled. At this point, not wanting to be the downer, Kate seemed to agree, as well. I didn't even bother to check with Sam.</p>
<p>"OK then. Everybody get a drink while I shuffle up and deal," I said.</p>
<p>I dealt clockwise, as if we were playing poker and not "weird dirty kinda sexy game I just made up." I was still workshopping the name, obviously.</p>
<p>The deal went Emma, Sam, Ashley, Kristen, Kate, then me. Looking back, people were sitting in a way that said a lot about what they wanted that night. At the time I was oblivious. I just assumed that everyone sat wherever.</p>
<p>I was so so so so wrong.</p>
<p>I looked down at what I had dealt myself. Ten. Not bad. Not a big winner, but not terrible either. Again, just like poker, we bet around in the order of the deal.</p>
<p>"I'll bet a sock, I guess," Emma said.</p>
<p>"We're doing clothes first?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell if he was happy about that or not. No one answered his question.</p>
<p>"OK, I'll call your sock," Sam said.</p>
<p>Ashley folded. So did Kristen and Kate. I looked at my ten.</p>
<p>"Oh what the hell."</p>
<p>It was just a sock, after all.</p>
<p>Emma showed a Jack. Sam had the Ace. I didn't even bother taking out my tiny ten.</p>
<p>"Ha ha!" Sam cried triumphantly.</p>
<p>Emma threw her sock at him. I did the same.</p>
<p>"What am I supposed to do with these?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"I dunno," I said, "but you won them."</p>
<p>"Yay for me?" Sam said, "I mean, ummm, yay for me!"</p>
<p>"That's the spirit," Emma told him.</p>
<p>Sam looked over at Kate as if to say, "See, not so bad?"</p>
<p>Kate smiled back, wanly.</p>
<p>The rest of the round was sock city. I didn't see anything higher than an eight. To pass the time, I played a little game with myself—giving each of the girls a little award.</p>
<p>Kate was clearly most beautiful overall. Best hair went to Kristen's extra super long blonde hair, no question. Although I could kinda see Ashley's tight blonde curls as a dark horse. I liked watching them sproing every time she moved her head.</p>
<p>Best boobs went to Kate with Kristen a close second. Best eyes: Emma. Best mouth: Kate again. Best hands: Ashley. They were so quick and thin; I couldn't help but fantasize about her wrapping them around my cock.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Best legs went to Kate, though I would certainly put Emma in there as well. I'm not a foot guy, but Emma's left one was out there and it was pretty cute, so she got best foot.</p>
<p>Everyone's a winner on the yacht tonight!</p>
<p>We took a break after the first round of cards. When everyone sat back down, fully refreshed with drink in hand, we all seemed a little more comfortable—a little more into the rhythm of the game. It didn't hurt that Emma had 'found' another joint and was passing it around as we dealt the cards. "Strange, PG-rated, drunk poker-ish game" was a success. Good times.</p>
<p>By the time the deal had come back to me a second time, Emma, Ashley and Kristen were all barefoot and I was giddy with the thought that we were going to be seeing some boobies shortly.</p>
<p>The break hadn't changed my luck any, sadly. I was card dead. On the one hand it kept me clothed because I had nothing that was even worth betting on. On the other, it made me look like a prude in my own game. So far, Emma was really the one driving things, keeping it lively.</p>
<p>But Sam was really the big winner. The deck just slapped him in the face. It seemed like he had a huge hand every time. Sam bet almost every deal but still hadn't lost even a sock. He'd gotten kisses on the cheek from my sister and Ashley, plus a nice French-y one from his girlfriend that, mysteriously, was the only time Kate had bet. Sam leaned back, covered in people's socks, looking satisfied with himself.</p>
<p>"Does anyone want another break?" I asked, getting ready to deal for the third time.</p>
<p>"Hell no!" Sam said.</p>
<p>The girls all laughed. I felt warm and happy and high. I dealt the cards.</p>
<p>Emma folded almost before I gave her the card, then jumped up to use the bathroom. Sam, again all swagger, bet an item of clothing.</p>
<p>"Winner's choice," he said, and winked.</p>
<p>Ashley raised to a kiss. Kristen folded and followed her friend to the bathroom. I wondered if that was on purpose. Did everyone have a conversation like Sam and I had, picking our targets for the evening?</p>
<p>Kate folded, giving her boyfriend a bit of a scowl. Sam was having way too much fun to care.</p>
<p>I was starting to get a little invested here. For one thing, I wouldn't mind a kiss from Ashley. Her cuteness had progressed to super cute since I first met her. I imagined running my hands through her curls as we pressed our lips and...</p>
<p>Well anyway. Yeah. Kissing Ashley would be good. And after all this, I kinda wanted to just...get in the game. It really wasn't much fun sitting there watching everyone else have a little dirty fun.</p>
<p>But most importantly, I wanted to knock Sam down a peg. He was getting cocky. It would be fun to teach him a lesson and get Ashley as my reward. So when I looked down and saw yet another 4, I was legitimately distraught.</p>
<p>I folded. Ashley turned over a queen. Nice card. Sam made a big show of looking shocked, then turned over his Ace, cackling. Kate and I looked at each other and shook our heads. Ashley leaned over and made to kiss Sam on the cheek.</p>
<p>"Oh no," Sam declared, "I want this one on the lips."</p>
<p>"Which lips?" Ashley asked, smiling. Sam touched her face.</p>
<p>"These. For now."</p>
<p>"Sam!" Kate cried, appalled. Ashley laughed and clapped.</p>
<p>Sam leaned back on his elbows and gestured for Ashley to slide forward. Ashley stood up and sauntered over to Sam. Then she leaned in, slow and sensuous, letting all her best bits drag slowly over Sam. She pressed her lips to his, even snaked her tongue out a little as a tease, then quickly bounced back up as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Ashley smiled and then traipsed off to the bathroom. Sam was posing for his picture in the dictionary under "shit eating grin."</p>
<p>"Maybe we should take a break after all," Kate said. She stood up and stormed off.</p>
<p>"Dude," I said.</p>
<p>"Come on, man," Sam said, "It's just a game. What did she think was going to happen?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, but she's your girlfriend. Don't you think you should, I dunno, talk to her or something?"</p>
<p>Sam waved me off.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Emma asked as she returned from the bathroom.</p>
<p>"Ashley kissed Sam."</p>
<p>"So what?"</p>
<p>"Well, Kate's upset, seeing as how she's his girlfriend and all."</p>
<p>"Whatever," Emma said, "from what I heard last night she's getting hers."</p>
<p>"You heard that last night?" I asked, surprised.</p>
<p>"The Libyans heard that last night," Emma said, "I don't see the big deal. It's just a game. Like, we knew all this was coming. Why get all worked up about it?"</p>
<p>I shrugged. I guess I could see both sides of it. Everyone was still milling about, unsure of whether we would restart the game without Kate or if we had already reached the breaking point. My balls were already aching and I hadn't seen a card higher than a ten. I wasn't going to end the game now.</p>
<p>I found Kate in the master bedroom. She sat on the edge of the bed and rested her head in her hands. Her eyes were a little red, like she had been crying. Is it wrong that that kinda turned me on a little?</p>
<p>"Look, Kate..."</p>
<p>"I know, I know. It's 'just a game.' But feelings don't just go away cause cards are involved. Mine don't anyway."</p>
<p>"So don't play."</p>
<p>"But he's playing," Kate cried.</p>
<p>"OK," I said, "you're right. If you were my girlfriend I wouldn't want you out there doing...stuff."</p>
<p>She smiled at that and squeezed my hand.</p>
<p>"I dunno," I said and stared down at my parents' beige carpeting, "you're pretty special. I think so anyway. I wouldn't want to share you with anyone."</p>
<p>Kate just looked at me, eyes shining. I looked back at up at her. She was still clasping my one hand in two of hers.</p>
<p>"So you have a choice," I said, "you can go get your boyfriend and yell at him like he's a naughty child in front of everyone. Then probably one or both of you leaves in the morning."</p>
<p>"I don't..."</p>
<p>"Or," I said, looking her right in those big beautiful blue eyes, "you can show him what it feels like when the person you love is with someone else. And maybe have a little fun."</p>
<p>We all sat back down. I poured everyone a fresh drink and dealt the cards. Emma folded. Sam—maybe feeling at least a little chastened?—folded, too. Ashley bet a kiss. After watching what she did to Sam...that bet wasn't exactly scaring me off, I'll put it that way.</p>
<p>Kristen folded. Then Kate looked up from her card.</p>
<p>"I'll call," she said. Everyone sucked in their breath.</p>
<p>"The kiss, you mean," Emma said, her surprise showing, "you'll give a kiss if you lose."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Kate said, as if this were something she had done all game. I looked at my card and saw a six taunting me. I folded.</p>
<p>Ashley smiled and turned over a Jack, triumphantly. The whole room held its breath and turned to look at Kate. She just smiled and showed her card: a deuce.</p>
<p>Kate stood up and walked over to Ashley. With one hand, Kate reached down and pulled Ashley up to her feet. Then, without even so much as a pause, Kate shoved her tongue down the shocked girl's throat.</p>
<p>The whole room erupted in cheers. No peck on the lips, this—both girls sucked face (and tongue. Lots and lots of tongue) for a good five minutes. At one point, I swear I saw Ashley graze Kate's magnificent left boob.</p>
<p>I looked back at Sam, worried, but he just smiled—entranced by watching his girlfriend go at it with another woman—and gave me an enthusiastic thumbs up. I showed him the same, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>Now we had ourselves a game.</p>
<p>Once everyone had settled, "Really risky, somewhat dirty, poker-ish game" got underway for reals. Unintentionally, I'm sure, Kate had inspired perhaps the most wonderful turn of events ever: girls kissing each other!</p>
<p>Sam and I sat back, not even bothering to play our cards, as the girls all got into the latest fad. Ashley kissed Kate again. Then Emma kissed Ashley. Then Emma kissed Kate. These weren't chaste little brushes either—this was full on, passionate, mouth-to-mouth and tongue-to-tongue. If I was hard before I was...well a heck of a lot harder now.</p>
<p>Then it was Kristen's turn. She had bet a kiss because, well, that's what everyone was doing. But I don't think she really thought it through. When she lost to Emma her face went practically ashen.</p>
<p>Emma leaned over to her bff for the now customary make out session, but Kristen pulled back.</p>
<p>"I have a boyfriend," Kristen said, shyly.</p>
<p>"So?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>"So I don't want to cheat on him," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"Lots of us have boyfriends," Kate said, as if she had been letting loose all evening.</p>
<p>"He's your boy friend," Ashley said with a wicked grin, "that means he's your boy. Kissing a girl is only cheating if you have a girl friend."</p>
<p>Well that explanation certainly made sense to me.</p>
<p>"So Sam could make out with Jason and it wouldn't be cheating?" Kate asked.</p>
<p>"Exactly," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"Well that's not happening," Sam said.</p>
<p>"Too bad. Sounds kinda hot," Emma said. Sam turned as pink as a toy pony.</p>
<p>"I'm just not...not into that stuff."</p>
<p>Kristen's voice got quieter and quieter as the argument went on. She had her arms wrapped around her chest and her eyes went everywhere but to us.</p>
<p>"What stuff?" Ashley asked. Uh oh.</p>
<p>"Y'know. Girl and...girl stuff," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"You mean you're not a dyke," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"No," Kristen said. I had to lean forward to hear her.</p>
<p>"So it's ok for everyone else to fool around, but you're too good for it," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"No. I just..."</p>
<p>"Lay off her, Ashley," Emma said, "her family's like, really super Christian."</p>
<p>"Oh, whatever," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"C'mon Kristen," Kate said, "it's not like it's a big deal."</p>
<p>Wow. New Kate was really coming out swinging. Hooray for new Kate!</p>
<p>"Isn't Emma, like, your best friend?" Ashley asked, "Don't you love your best friend?"</p>
<p>"Well...yeah...I mean, but..."</p>
<p>"Don't you want to show your best friend how much you love her?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>"It'll be fun," Sam said.</p>
<p>"It's ok," Emma took her friend's hands and leaned in.</p>
<p>Their lips touched. Kristen kissed back a little. It was tender and warm. The two just shared each other. Appreciated each other. It might have been the least adventurous kiss of the night so far. It also might have been the hottest.</p>
<p>Emma enthusiastically pressed her mouth to Kristen's. Kristen tentatively tasted back. It was an honest kiss. Ashley may have been kidding around, but it really was love. They pulled away, both a little starry eyed.</p>
<p>"Wow," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"See, not so bad," Sam said.</p>
<p>Kristen just smiled dreamily. But she stopped betting kisses.</p>
<p>Some things, sadly, did not change. My cards were still flat out horrible, unplayable, shitty shitty shit. Sam just kept on winning. And the girls were out of socks.</p>
<p>The round after the girl-on-girl extravaganza began with Emma giving Sam a full on, full tongue kiss along with a little harmless groping. It was weird watching my little sister get it on with my best friend. I was crushed between really super creeped out and really super jealous.</p>
<p>The next hand I looked down at a nine, my second-highest card of the night. I decided to start pushing my luck. I was near last to act. I already knew I'd be kissing Sam or my sister if I lost, so no kissing for me. I was out of socks, so I bet my shirt. If I beat Sam, I could always just order him to kiss Kate, if anything just because I felt bad for her. Or he'd kiss me on the cheek. Whatever. No big deal.</p>
<p>Sam turned over a King. Of course.</p>
<p>I handed my shirt over.</p>
<p>"You can give that thing a big ol' sniff if you like," I said.</p>
<p>"Nah," Sam said.</p>
<p>He gave the shirt to Kristen, which I think was his little way of trying to help me out.</p>
<p>So now I was bored, lonely and a little cold. .</p>
<p>"Nice pecs," Emma said, smiling.</p>
<p>"She's right," Kate added, "when did my high school bestie start working out?"</p>
<p>"I joined the crew team at school," I confessed.</p>
<p>"Nice," Ashley said, "those guys are always the hottest."</p>
<p>Kristen looked at Ashley, confused.</p>
<p>"What?" Ashley said.</p>
<p>Emma raised her eyebrows at me and smiled. She ran her eyes up and down my chest and kind of chewed at her lower lip. Suddenly I didn't feel like covering my chest anymore.</p>
<p>Sam dealt the next hand, impatient to change the subject. This time, I didn't even have the choice to be aggressive—a three.</p>
<p>When the cards came to Kristen, she bet. Kristen was also out of socks. She was still suffering from her kiss from the previous round.</p>
<p>Kristen bet her shirt. Sam had bet a kiss and Kristen seemed confident she had him now.</p>
<p>Kristen may have seemed like a prude and I guess in some ways she was. But it's not like she didn't want to have fun. Just, y'know, safe, expected, not too outside the norm kinda fun. A neat little story she could tell at her bachelorette party before her big church wedding. A little feel from Sam would be just fine by her, I gathered. Still, Kristen had given a little pout when I tossed in my cards earlier. Maybe she and I were on the same wavelength.</p>
<p>Kristen turned over her King, triumphantly. Sam grinned wolfishly and showed his Ace.</p>
<p>Kristen didn't bother to hide her frustration.</p>
<p>"Alright," Sam cried, "let's see some goodies!"</p>
<p>"Sam!" Kate said.</p>
<p>"What?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"No, no," Kristen said, "a bet's a bet. I won't be the one to break it."</p>
<p>She seemed remarkably calm compared to her previous girl-kiss catastrophe. Kristen had been wearing a cute pj set—sky blue long pants and a matching long sleeve shirt. In the center of the top there was a little pink bunny shouting, "Sleepy Time!"</p>
<p>Kristen reached down for the hem of her shirt and pulled it off in one big flourish. She was wearing a bra, of course, a baby-chick yellow one. The material was thick, too, so there really wasn't much to see except her bellybutton and maybe a bit of the tops of her boobs. I'd seen formal dresses that showed more titty.</p>
<p>I now knew her chest was as freckly as her face. That was pretty hot. Just by the bra, I could tell Kristen was a D-cup.</p>
<p>It was our first, closest look at girl-naked in the game. Really, everyone was pretty excited. Kristen threw her now discarded shirt at Sam who made a big show of taking a deep deep sniff of it. Everyone laughed at that.</p>
<p>"Gross, Sam!" Kristen said.</p>
<p>"Whatever," Sam replied, dismissively.</p>
<p>With Kristen now on display, I silently moved her up to the pole position (ha ha) in my 'best boobs" rankings. Kate would just have to settle for second breast. Er, best.</p>
<p>The next hand went almost exactly the same, only this time it was my little sis making, and losing, the bet. Emma was wearing jogging shorts and a little t-shirt that said "Don't stop till you drop." The context made the line seem a little suggestive.</p>
<p>Much like her friend, Emma stripped off her shirt in one swoop, revealing a cute little white bra with laces across the top. Again, there wasn't much to see. Emma wasn't flat-chested by any means. I doubt the Itty Bitty Titty Committee would even consider her application. But when it came to breasts, little Emmy was definitely on the honor roll (all A's and B's). Whatever. Quality vs quantity and all that. Anyone could see that my sis had a nice set of tits.</p>
<p>It helped that those little titties jutted out proudly over a taught stomach that looked a little six-pack-y in some positions. Also, because of how Em's shorts sat, I could get a little sneak preview. Little sis definitely shaved a good amount down there.</p>
<p>So all awesome.</p>
<p>"Nice," I said, returning Emma's compliment from earlier.</p>
<p>Em glowed proudly at the praise and even pushed her bust out a little further. Sam sniffed the shirt again, naturally, and declared Emma's the best smelling, so far. So I guess Emma had that category in hand. Best smelling t-shirt. Good on her.</p>
<p>The next hand went pretty straightforward. Sam got another kiss, this time from his girlfriend. I could tell she was really trying now, but Sam seemed disconnected. It wasn't just that a kiss from his gf wasn't that 'risky,' but there seemed to be so much more fun to be had than kisses and bras and Sam was impatient with the process. If everyone went to bed before the good stuff got going, what was the point? Also I think his lips were starting to get chapped.</p>
<p>Kate dealt the next hand. If we fell more or less to form, this would be the last hand before we took a bio break. I folded as usual. So did Emma</p>
<p>Sam bet, offering up his shirt. He was wearing one of those long-sleeve waffle-y shirt things. Ashley called his bet, shirt for shirt. Everyone else folded. I could tell people were anxious for the break.</p>
<p>Ashley grinned at Sam.</p>
<p>"Show me what you got, Sammy," Ashley teased. He turned over a King.</p>
<p>"Shit," Ashley said.</p>
<p>Sam laughed.</p>
<p>"Shit. Shit. Shit."</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Kate asked, legitimately concerned.</p>
<p>"One of these days, your luck's gonna turn," Ashley warned Sam.</p>
<p>"You better hope it happens before you're completely naked," Sam said.</p>
<p>"Shit," Ashley said again, "Of all the days to not wear a bra..."</p>
<p>She had been wearing a big brown sweater that came almost to her knees. Thick and wooly, I got scratchy just looking at it. Ashley reached down and slowly, reluctantly, lifted up the sweater. Her curls jiggled happily as Ashley pulled the sweater over her head.</p>
<p>Everyone froze. I swear one of the girls gasped.</p>
<p>I was going to have to redo my "best boobs" list.</p>
<p>They weren't the biggest in the room, not by a long shot. But holy fucking shit did Ashley have the most amazing rack I'd ever seen. They were perfect. Ideal. The Aristotelian philosophical highest good of breasts.</p>
<p>Full, taut, almost floating, they were just a little bit bigger than a handful with small, pink areola and sharp little nippies just begging to be sucked. At that moment, in a strange way, I felt almost proud of my little lamp. She came with much better bulbs than advertised.</p>
<p>"Holy fucking shit," Sam breathed.</p>
<p>Ashley smiled sheepishly.</p>
<p>"Holy shit, Ash!" Kate exclaimed. She looked just as surprised as us that she had said it.</p>
<p>"Niiiiice pecs," Emma said, and reached over to Ashley for a fist bump. Emma was clearly going for a laugh, but she wasn't completely kidding either.</p>
<p>Ashley's Amazing MammariesTM (patent pending, all rights reserved), jiggled alluringly as she reached over and met Emma's fist with her own.</p>
<p>"Well, on that note, I need another drink," Kristen said, "and maybe a good cry."</p>
<p>"Oh come on, Krissy," Emma faux-pouted, "I'm sure you have extra super nice titties under there, too."</p>
<p>Kristen just shook her head, but I was pretty sure that Emma was right. I finished my drink and cleaned up the cards for the next round.</p>
<p>This was about as far as we had ever gotten at these high school things, I reflected. By now, people were tired, or my parents were making noises, or people were just afraid to go any further. Yet right now, this felt more like the beginning of the party than the ending.</p>
<p>I passed Sam in the hall.</p>
<p>"So who've you got your eye on?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Who are you looking to take down, great white hunter?" Sam said, hitting me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"Oh. I dunno. Does it matter?"</p>
<p>"Of course it does. If I know who you're going for I can get out of the way."</p>
<p>"You have a girlfriend," I said, "why do you care?"</p>
<p>Sam just shrugged.</p>
<p>"Just don't want to step on your toes 's all," he said.</p>
<p>I surveyed the field and thought about it for a moment.</p>
<p>"Kristen?" I said. I wasn't too confident about it.</p>
<p>"OK, cool," Sam said, then wandered off.</p>
<p>We sat back down in our circle. Ashley's breasts still stood at full attention. I noticed Kristen had adjusted her bra slightly to try and show a little more top-boob. I know it sounds weird, but I was kinda proud of her for it.</p>
<p>Emma cleared her throat. She sat very formally, as if totally unaware that her tits were just...hanging out there in her bra. It was like I was watching the best version of C-Span, ever. Or maybe the strangest Supreme Court hearing. Whatever. It was awesome. I could tell through the material that her little nipples were hard. Holy fuck, I could see my little sister's hard little nipples!</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"We girls have decided to make some changes to the game," Emma announced. The rest of the girls nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Sam and I looked at each other, warily. Here came the end of the fun.</p>
<p>"Instead of just making a bet of like, just, whatever, everyone has to match the bet. So no more bets where my sock counts as much as your kiss. If you bet a kiss, I have to at least match your kiss or raise it."</p>
<p>"How do we decide what's worth more?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Group decision," Emma said, "but I'm pretty sure we're gonna be able to figure it out."</p>
<p>That dirty little minx!</p>
<p>"So, I just want to be clear about this," I said, "Ashley says kiss and I raise blowjob, in order to stay in the hand Ashley has to agree to suck me off if she loses?"</p>
<p>"Pretty much," Ashley smiled.</p>
<p>"And you're all ok with this?" I asked, looking pointedly at Kate. She nodded, slowly.</p>
<p>I turned to Sam.</p>
<p>"Did you slip ecstasy into all their drinks when I wasn't looking?" I asked, only half-kidding.</p>
<p>"I swear to God I did not," Sam said. If anything he was even more flabbergasted than I was.</p>
<p>"Well ok then," I said, "You guys said you wanted a game. I guess we've got ourselves a game."</p>
<p>I'm not sure what made the girls suddenly decide to 'go for the gold' as it were. Maybe I underestimated just how drunk/high/horny everyone was. Maybe the girls wanted to see just how far us boys were really willing to go before calling it a night. Maybe they all were just sick of all this bullshit and wanted to get laid. Lord knows, that's where I was at.</p>
<p>I have no idea what possessed them to take this to the next level. Regardless, "dangerous, sexy, naked, relationship-destroying, kinda poker-like game" was a go.</p>
<p>The first hand went pretty normal. Sam bet shirt. No one called. Sam kept his shirt. Ashley bet pants. No one called. Ashley kept her cute, little beige tights/leggings thingies. I assumed she had at least worn panties, but after last round all bets were off.</p>
<p>Again, I was card dead. Card deceased. High hand of a ten. I started to wonder if I'd ever see a face card. Maybe there weren't any more. Maybe someone was dealing from the bottom of the deck. Maybe God hated me. I was sitting there, topless, with a bunch of hot, impossibly horny girls, and I couldn't even touch one of them. We were playing a game designed to cause as much fooling around as possible and somehow I was getting less action if we'd just, I dunno, rented a porno and seen who hooked up with who.</p>
<p>It could not get any worse.</p>
<p>And then it did.</p>
<p>Cards started showing up. Bettable, playable, winnable cards. No Aces, mind you. But hands I had to bet or else I might as well not play. And every. Single. One. Lost.</p>
<p>The first hand I looked down at a jack and bet my pants. Kristen turned over a Queen. So I shucked off my pants.</p>
<p>I was wearing pretty tight boxers, but I could have been wrapped in sailcloth and my dick would have shown through. It had been hours of semi-naked girls making out with each other. Plus the previous night's experience. Plus no girlfriend in months... I was beyond blue-balled. I was purple-balled. They didn't just ache, it felt like they swelled with my semen. Like I was lugging around two bowling balls full of baby batter. Every time I moved I felt my two, exta-sensative, over-filled, suddenly gigantic balls.</p>
<p>Which says nothing of where my dick was at. At this point, I felt like flag poles were flaccid compared to what I was carrying. In all honesty, it was almost more painful than anything else. I needed frickin' relief. And it showed.</p>
<p>I had to stand up to take off my pajama pants—long red and black flannel-y things like you see in the J. Crew catalogue—so everyone got a good look at what was going on. Going on in my pants. Yeah.</p>
<p>Little Jason was barely contained by the, thankfully, tight cloth. He was desperately trying to push his way out anyway he knew how. After clearly trying to escape up through the waistband, the big guy looked to be trying to go out through the legs of my boxers.</p>
<p>Standing there, I shifted and kind of rolled my hips to try to push him down. But he just popped back up, proud as could be, and even left a little wet spot on the front of my boxers for everyone to see.</p>
<p>It was pulsing in time with my heartbeat. My heart was racing. It was a bad combo.</p>
<p>"Nice calves, bro!" Emma called out from behind me, proudly.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Kristen said, staring at my front almost hypnotized, "Calves."</p>
<p>"Well at least you're taking attention away from my breasts," Ashley laughed.</p>
<p>I threw my pants over to Kristen. She looked almost sheepish about her victory. Emma gave her friend a hearty slap on the back, like Kristen had just pulled out the anchor run for the win at a state meet.</p>
<p>I slowly sat down, hoping my cock wouldn't just jump right out.</p>
<p>It hardly mattered.</p>
<p>Two hands later I pulled a Queen. A goddamn, motherfucking Queen. She winked at me as I gazed upon her regal visage. Oh yes. Finally.</p>
<p>"Fold," Emma said.</p>
<p>"Fold," Sam announced. He had been curiously quiet since the last restart. Had the deck finally started to steer away from him?</p>
<p>"I'll bet pants," Ashley said coyly.</p>
<p>"Pants," Kristen agreed.</p>
<p>"Pants are fine," Kate said, looking right at her boyfriend when she said it. Oh no. Was Kate trying to play chicken with her boyfriend? Did she think if she went too far then he would stop this? Oh no. This was bad bad bad. I decided I would intervene. Warn Kate that she was gonna be disappointed. Sam was my best friend, but Kate had been my buddy for a long time, too. I didn't want to see her heart broken.</p>
<p>But first, I had a hand to win.</p>
<p>"I raise," I announced, "Underwear."</p>
<p>"Wait," Kristen interrupted, "if he wins I have to take off my pants and my panties?"</p>
<p>She didn't look too happy with that.</p>
<p>"Since when does one piece of clothing count as much as two?" Kate asked.</p>
<p>"It's all I have to bet," I complained.</p>
<p>"I dunno," Emma said, "underwear should be worth a lot more than pants, don't you think? I mean, Jason's gonna have to take out his...Jason if he loses."</p>
<p>"Doesn't seem fair," Sam said.</p>
<p>Geez, thanks buddy. Now I really didn't feel bad about warning his girlfriend.</p>
<p>"How about this," I said, "I'll bet naked. So I'm not betting an article of clothing here, just full nudity. So you have to put out your full nudity to match the bet. That way, it's clothes agnostic."</p>
<p>"You sure do use some big funny words, " Ashley teased, talking in an exaggerated drawl.</p>
<p>"But," I continued, "If I win the bet, I get my clothes back."</p>
<p>"No way," Emma said, a little too quickly.</p>
<p>"What?" I asked, "I'm betting full nudity so if I win I should get some amount of un-nudity."</p>
<p>"You're getting to see everyone else naked. That's what you're getting," Emma retorted.</p>
<p>"What about pants?" I asked, "can I get my pants, at least?"</p>
<p>Look, I wanted to get some action as much as anyone at this point. But I also didn't want to be sitting in front of a bunch of clothed people so...exposed. I guess there's a little prude in all of us. Mine was trying to fight its way out of my boxers and fuck everything in the house. Girls, couches, tables—he didn't fucking care. Right now, all I wanted, was not to have everyone examining my little buddy.</p>
<p>"Fine. Pants," Emma said. I just glared back. What had I ever done to her?</p>
<p>"The bet is nudity," I repeated, "call or fold."</p>
<p>"Or raise!" Ashley said, clearly enjoying herself. Holy fuck, was she about to raise? What would that even mean? I'd happily lose my underwear for something...</p>
<p>"I...will..." Ashley drew it out, "fold."</p>
<p>She tossed her card into the pile. Her beautiful titties shook oh so pleasantly as she tossed. Little Jason bopped his head up and down in agreement. I started to wonder if I might need medical attention after this entire escapade. Erection for over four hours and whatnot. I hadn't even taken one of those magical little blue pills.</p>
<p>"I'm out, too," Kristen sighed dejectedly. Kate reached out like she was going to fold, as well.</p>
<p>"Wait, no one is calling?" Ashley asked, "I'd have stayed in if I thought you girls were gonna pussy out."</p>
<p>Kate pulled her card back, considering it.</p>
<p>"Fine," she said, "call."</p>
<p>Ashley clapped excitedly. She wasn't even in the stupid hand anymore.</p>
<p>It didn't matter. I wanted the call. I needed the call. If everyone folded, I'd be back to sitting there in my underwear, waiting for another shot.</p>
<p>There was no way Kate considered folding if she had a king or an ace. I was getting my pants back. Then all of them could show me their precious little parts and see how they felt about it.</p>
<p>I turned over my Queen. I heard a snort from Kate.</p>
<p>"Oh god," Kate said, giggling now.</p>
<p>"Oh god I'm so so sorry," she said, "I really really am. Oh Jay. Oh JJ."</p>
<p>Kate was full on laughing now, bent over, bright red, tears streaming from her eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh Jason. Oh my little Jay Bird," Kate gasped, using Emma's pet name for me. Not even my parents called me that. Only Emma. Was Kate trying to rile me up?</p>
<p>"Looks like little Jay Bird's going to be coming out of his cage!" Kate squealed.</p>
<p>Without even trying to stop laughing, Kate turned over her card. King.</p>
<p>Fuck king. Fuck.</p>
<p>"I thought you had the Ace," Kate rested her hand on my naked thigh, "I swear I thought you had the Ace."</p>
<p>She was still laughing hysterically. Any thought I had about intervening on her behalf was gone. If she was gonna play it like that, then I could play that way, too. Consequences be damned.</p>
<p>"If you thought I had the ace, then why did you call?" I asked through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>"Ashley told me to," Kate said innocently.</p>
<p>Then she started laughing again. Finally she went still, she tipped her head back, her face still bright red, and took a long, deep breath. She rubbed her eyes with her fingers.</p>
<p>"Oh God, that was good," Kate said, "It's been a while since I've had one of those. I think I need a tissue."</p>
<p>"Did your girlfriend just have an orgasm in front of all of us?" Ashley needled Sam.</p>
<p>He didn't answer. It suddenly occurred to me that despite months of dating in a sexually active relationship, he legitimately did not know what Kate's orgasms were like.</p>
<p>Well that was very very interesting, wasn't it? I was so intrigued, I almost forgot what was about to happen.</p>
<p>"Let's go, big bro," Emma said, "time to pay your debts."</p>
<p>Dammit.</p>
<p>I slowly stood. Four pairs of eyes were purely focused on me. Sam at least had the decency to not look directly at my crotch. Good man.</p>
<p>My own little sister on the other hand? She just stared straight on like everyone else—a little embarrassed, a bit impatient, and very very excited.</p>
<p>I started to lower my boxers. I didn't want to prolong my agony. I just really didn't want to take off my boxers. Finally, they slipped down to my knees. My cock just popped right back up, little jack-in-the-box that he was, happily boinging back and forth.</p>
<p>I bent over to pull my boxers off my ankles and then stood straight up. Little Jason did the same, in all his happy, horny glory.</p>
<p>"Whoah," I heard one of the girls say. I couldn't even tell who said it.</p>
<p>"Big brother, indeed," Ashley gasped.</p>
<p>I looked over at Emma, almost pleadingly, but she was completely focused on what I had just revealed. My dick. My johnson. My schlong. My cock. My little sister was completely entranced by her big brother's cock.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>"That is..." Emma stumbled. Was she actually salivating?</p>
<p>"Are they always so...?" Kristen asked, almost to herself. Ashley slowly shook her head, no.</p>
<p>"Oh," Kristen said. It was almost like she had a little cum right there, thinking about it.</p>
<p>"That is one nice cock, bro," Emma finally got her words out. She didn't move her eyes off me. None of the girls did.</p>
<p>"Wow," Kate said. Sam whipped his head around and glared at her.</p>
<p>"I've seen a lot of d in my day," Ashley said, "Gotta say, that might be the gold medalist right there."</p>
<p>"Wow," This time Kristen said it. Sam gave her a glare, too, for good measure.</p>
<p>Slowly, like I was being watched by hungry predators (and let's be clear, I really, truly was), I lowered myself back onto the floor. Just from the way I was sitting, kinda cross-legged, my erection was at least somewhat obscured. But still. He was out and ready to play. And it looked like he had a few eager playmates waiting for him.</p>
<p>So now I had to update my "best list." Best boobs was clearly Ashley. Best body was probably Emma, though I still held out hope for Kate's big reveal. And best cock?</p>
<p>Well, that would be me. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Looking back, this was the moment that finally broke my best friend. There was a lot more to come. A lot more. Much worse stuff, if I'm being honest. But this is what triggered it. I can't help but think we should have handled things differently.</p>
<p>I should have stopped the game right there. The girls should have been much more reserved in their praise of my equipment, or much more enthusiastic about Sam's. We should have seen how things were snowballing and stepped in to stop it.</p>
<p>This is the sequence of events that ended my friendship with my best friend. It's easy now to look back and see all the places that we screwed up. That I screwed up. But at the time, I was having way too much fun to pay attention.</p>
<p>Suddenly things got really good, really fast. Which was very, very bad.</p>
<p>Now that my dick was out, all bets were on.</p>
<p>In a flurry of hands, Kate was down to only a bra and panties—a very tasteful, lacy, black matching set that, unlike what the other girls were wearing—seemed intended as much for the viewer as the wearer.</p>
<p>Before, it had been easy to forget just how massive Kate's boobies were, but now in just a bra they reasserted their wondrous dominance. Ashley still had the quality, but Kate's second best breasts were still a winner in my book.</p>
<p>Kate was now showing really nice abs with a cute little butt to boot. And thanks to the lacy panties, we also now knew that Kate shaved. I mean, like, shaved shaved. Hard to argue with that.</p>
<p>So the best body award went back to Kate. Thanks for playing, everyone!</p>
<p>Kristen lost her pants as well. For someone so...reserved, Kristen seemed pretty happy to be playing the game. Maybe it was her competitive side. Kristen just liked winning. It's why she and Emma got along so well. Or maybe she was just really really horny after years of being told her body was evil. Who knows?</p>
<p>Anyway, now Kristen was down to her matching baby-chick yellow panties as well. They were surprisingly not very gramma-ish, though they certainly provided plenty of coverage. Gotta say, the yellow set looked really awesome with Kristen's impossibly long blonde hair.</p>
<p>Also, this meant that Kristen's legs were now out and about, and holy fuck were those a nice matching set. Long (remember, Kristen is almost my height), toned and tanned, I'm sure she kept leg men up all night with those kickers.</p>
<p>So, Kristen took the leg category. Duh.</p>
<p>Best of all though, we finally got Ashley out of her little beige stocking-things. Those things were so tight, it really wasn't much of a reveal. But we did find out that Ashley had at least worn panties to our little party—a tiny pink thong that protected almost nothing. Surprisingly, there was a good amount of hair down there, though it was wispy and blonde and really barely noticeable. I'd have lost that bet big time.</p>
<p>Oh, also on those panties, a nice dark wet spot. Dead center. Holy fuck did I want to fuck that girl.</p>
<p>With Kristen and Kate pants-less and Ashley down to her undies, we were ever so close to opening up the best pussy category. I couldn't wait to weigh in on that one. Good ol' Ashley had the early lead.</p>
<p>Yet for all that—Emma was down to a bra and her shorts. The K-girls (Kate and Kristen) were both in underwear, only. Ashley was down to almost nothing and I was down to nothing nothing—Sam was the center of attention.</p>
<p>He seemed to grasp the new betting dynamic of the game better than anyone and was using it to his advantage. He threw out big bets (hand jobs, blow jobs, titty jobs, lots o' jobs) to force folds when he was weak and then let us bet into him when he was strong. Thus the sudden loss of everyone's clothes. Nothing had come of Sam's aggressive offers yet, but sooner or later someone would have to force a showdown. Or we'd all be doing Sam soon.</p>
<p>Not me, though.</p>
<p>So much was going on (and coming off) it was easy for me to let go of being insecure about rocking out with my cock out. No one was as naked as me, yet, but it didn't seem like I had long to wait. My cock was literally drooling with anticipation.</p>
<p>But I was card-dead once again. My options were either to take a serious risk now—my only betting options had super high stakes—or bide my time for something strong. I was out of play. For the moment.</p>
<p>With nothing to do, I stood up and made naked drinks (same as regular drinks, just made by a naked guy). Ashley walked back from using the bathroom and gave my dick a nice hard squeeze as she passed. I almost came right there on the counter. She just smiled at me and went to sit. I watched her bare buns bounce back and forth the whole way down. Ffffffffuck.</p>
<p>"I think it's time to get some action," Sam declared, rubbing his hands in anticipation.</p>
<p>I dealt myself a 6 because...I don't know why. I hate myself? I must hate myself. Even my cock was eyeing me with disdain.</p>
<p>Emma folded. Sam, the only one of us with bare feet and clothes everywhere else, bet his shirt.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Sam's plan was suddenly completely clear. Completely unstoppable. He'd spent a whole round betting weak and holding strong. Everyone was on to his strategy.</p>
<p>Only Sam had already changed things up. Now he would bet strong and hold weak. By the time everyone figured it out, they'd be at his mercy. After that he could switch his bets pretty much at random. No one would be able to read him.</p>
<p>At that point, my guess was he'd fuck Ashley—he'd been eyeing her all night and she certainly seemed interested, as well—by the next round at latest. Then Kate would freak and the party would break. I could only hope to defeat my right hand at cards later that evening and win a quick jerk before heading back to the International College of Unfulfilled Ambitions.</p>
<p>Ashley, thinking she had him figured now, just folded. Weak meant strong right? Kristen folded without a second thought. Sam had nothing right now and the girls were going to give it to him anyway. Fuck fuck fuck.</p>
<p>"Fuck," Kate said, looking at her card. Her face was screwed up in thought. Goddamn was she gorgeous.</p>
<p>"I know you've got me," Kate said, "I just can't let go of this card. I just... Something about this feels off."</p>
<p>Sam, usually so boisterous, said nothing.</p>
<p>"Y'know what?" Kate said, "fuck it. You beat my jack, I'll jack you off. Whatever. Not exactly a big deal to give my own boyfriend a handy."</p>
<p>Actually, according to what Sam had told me, a 'handy' would have been a lovely surprise for him. But anyway, that hardly mattered.</p>
<p>Kate showed her jack. The room froze. Best case scenario we'd be seeing a girl do something with her boyfriend. Not exactly risqué. It still felt like we were at the precipice.</p>
<p>Sam stared at Kate's jack. He didn't even show his card. He just tossed it into the center and took off his shirt.</p>
<p>Sam didn't have a bad chest, if you're into dude's chests. Pretty well defined, not a lot of hair. Maybe a little skinny. Nice biceps, though. Not that I noticed.</p>
<p>No one noticed. Everyone was too shocked by his surrender. When I saw Kate's jack I thought she was an idiot. Now I realized she was a genius. Who knew her boyfriend better than her?</p>
<p>Next hand, Emma dealt me a five. Fucking bitch.</p>
<p>Sam, first to act, bet the full monty. He had the chance to go from fully clothed to fully nude in just two hands. Last round, a bet like that would scare everyone off. Not now. Not after Kate just de-pantsed her boyfriend. Figuratively. Sam wasn't literally de-pantsed. Not yet.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Ashley made him repeat his bet..</p>
<p>"Yeah. Naked," Sam said, not even looking up from his card.</p>
<p>Without blinking, Ashley bet him back.</p>
<p>"Oral."</p>
<p>Jeez, Ash, you couldn't just follow Kate's lead? Maybe start off with some light hand action?</p>
<p>I waited for the inevitable. Thanks to Sam's girlfriend, he was the only one getting laid on the boat, cards be damned. Now he was gonna get a blowjob from some chick with tremendous boobs and a beautiful bod.</p>
<p>Everyone else folded. I waited for Sam to reveal his strong card and tilt the game firmly in his favor.</p>
<p>Sam showed a nine. Ashley flipped a ten. A lousy freaking ten. And just like that, the king was dead.</p>
<p>Sam just stared at the ground and shook his head.</p>
<p>He slowly stood and slid off his plaid pajama pants. Sam's a cyclist. He's built like one—small and lithe with huge calves and crack-your-walnuts thighs. He looked so miserable as he shucked his pants, I felt kind of happy for him when a few of the girls complimented his legs.</p>
<p>Then the big reveal. I didn't really want to see my friend's cock. I mean, honestly, it's something I could have done without seeing in my lifetime. But he had to see mine, so I guess fair play and all. Still, could have lived without.</p>
<p>"Oh," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"Not bad, Sam," Ashley smiled.</p>
<p>"There's my little buddy," Kate cried, happily.</p>
<p>The look on Sam's face said it all. He was devastated. Destroyed.</p>
<p>It's not like he had a tiny, little prick. I mean, I haven't seen a ton to compare, but his looked fine. Not a porn penis, but no human has one of those. A good, thick, long member. Not that I noticed.</p>
<p>But the reactions...</p>
<p>When I had whipped mine out, I mean, part of me was pretty sure the girls were just being nice. I mean, that's what girls do right?</p>
<p>"Oh, I've never seen one that big before."</p>
<p>"I don't think that monster will fit inside me."</p>
<p>"Oh God, I've never felt anything so deep."</p>
<p>That's just shit girls are trained to say. Right? Like, you don't see your girlfriend naked for the first time and say, "wow, you really need a boob job."</p>
<p>No. You say,</p>
<p>"Wow honey, those are fantastic."</p>
<p>"Oh my god, your breasts are so beautiful."</p>
<p>"They're not small, they're perfect. I wouldn't change them in a second."</p>
<p>Even if, y'know, the girl really needs to get a boob job.</p>
<p>I figured my former girlfriends were just...doing that. I assumed that Kate, Ashley, Kristen, even Emma were just following the unwritten girl rules vis a vis penis appreciation. I expected that when Sam's little friend came out on stage, he would receive a similar, warm reception.</p>
<p>Apparently not. Apparently all those girls were being 100% completely honest. Which, OK, that's totally fucking awesome. Not gonna lie about that.</p>
<p>Yet there was poor Sam, my friend—a really truly good friend—suddenly coming up short. The girls had made their best efforts to be polite. They were obviously underwhelmed.</p>
<p>"It is a nice cock, Sam," Emma said as he sat down, giving him a good pat on the back.</p>
<p>His poor member, once standing proud, was now as droopy and deflated as Sam himself.</p>
<p>"Y'know what?"</p>
<p>I stood suddenly, unintentionally bringing my own little trophy back to the group's attention, "I think that's a game."</p>
<p>A few disappointed groans. A couple of accepting sighs.</p>
<p>"It's late. I'm tired. We're all tired. My buzz is almost gone. We've got a whole day of swimming tomorrow. This was fun. But I think it's time to call it."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah," Emma said, trying to sound excited, "That could be fun."</p>
<p>"I could make sandwiches," Kate said.</p>
<p>"I can help with that," Kristen volunteered. She had, like, 12 brothers and sisters. It was probably thrilling to make lunch for only 6 people.</p>
<p>"OK," I clapped my hands together, "that sounds like a plan. We'll sleep in, have a late breakfast..."</p>
<p>"No," Sam said.</p>
<p>I turned and looked at my friend, still sitting on the ground, His junk was well hidden behind his pale, toned legs.</p>
<p>"It's not fair," Sam said.</p>
<p>"C'mon honey, it's ok. Let's call it a night," Kate said. She clearly implied she would put out as soon as we split up.</p>
<p>"No. It's not fair," Sam repeated, "You girls play poker?"</p>
<p>The girls all shook their heads. Eight beautiful boobs shook along with them. Man, I had to get these girls to disagree with me more often.</p>
<p>"Jason plays poker. Right Jay?"</p>
<p>I agreed, somewhat reluctantly.</p>
<p>"You don't just...win a big hand and then walk away from the table. It's not good...what's the word?"</p>
<p>Sam snapped his fingers as he tried to think.</p>
<p>"Etiquette," I said.</p>
<p>"Right. It's not good etiquette," Sam said, "You win a monster hand, you sit down and let the table win some of its money back. Then, when things are a little more equitable, you get up and cash out."</p>
<p>"I don't think we did that for anyone else," Kristen said, cautiously.</p>
<p>"Sure we did," Sam said, his voice gaining in strength, "Remember when you had to kiss little Emmy before? We didn't just call it a night right there, because if we did you'd feel like shit. So we hung around and played a little longer.</p>
<p>"When Ash showed her titties, or when Katie lost her top or when JJ dropped trou none of them felt bad because we kept playing. We moved on. We let everybody feel like they came out a winner.</p>
<p>'Little Emmy' leaned forward. She would have looked pretty imposing except, y'know, she was topless. Her teeny tits did their best to hang down. So cute.</p>
<p>"He's kind of got a point," Emma said</p>
<p>"I don't want anyone to feel bad about tonight," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"Just a couple more hands, right?" Kate said.</p>
<p>"OK then," I said, resigned, "I'll go mix up another round of drinks. Em, if you've got any more pot, now's probably the time."</p>
<p>Emma lost her pants on the first hand, giving us a new clubhouse leader for "best pussy." Emma's panties were purple—a little more revealing than Kristen's, a lot less revealing than Ashley's.</p>
<p>I shouldn't have been able to see very much—just the slight indentation of lips and a little hair—but Emma was so wet the crotch was practically see-through.</p>
<p>"Geez, girl, did you pee yourself?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>Emma turned purpler than her panties.</p>
<p>"Nothing to be ashamed of," Ashley smiled, "I think it's kinda hot, myself. I love a girl who gets her juices going.</p>
<p>I smiled at my sister.</p>
<p>"It's a nice pussy," I whispered to her.</p>
<p>"You haven't seen anything yet," she whispered back. Holy fuck!</p>
<p>"You like your little sissy's pretty little purple panties?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>I can't believe I used to think this girl was quiet. Could we switch my little lamp back into silent mode?</p>
<p>"They're...very nice," I said, politely.</p>
<p>More importantly, as a result of the hand, Sam won his boxers back. Grey with a black band, he pulled them on like a plate armor before a joust.</p>
<p>With Sam satiated, I figured this really would be our last go-round.</p>
<p>The next hand, Sam bet big and we all folded around. The hand after, Emma bet a kiss and ended up smooching me on the cheek. It was sweet, like we were back at the beginning of the game. I'm sure she touched my cock by accident. She was probably just as mortified as me. Although, she certainly didn't look mortified...</p>
<p>Ashley's deal was another bet and fold scenario. Sam raised to oral but found no takers. For a guy who had a guaranteed piece of ass that night, he sure seemed desperate to get some action.</p>
<p>I had a 10, which was probably worth calling, except with just me and Sam in the pot, it didn't matter who won—we'd both lose. At this point, I had resigned myself to ending the game empty. Tomorrow was another evening.</p>
<p>Ashley and Kristen had both shown interest at times. Maybe I could talk one of them into a little after lunch exploration. Although Ashley seemed more interested in Sam and Kristen had the conservative background/in a relationship double whammy. Neither of them was even close to a sure thing.</p>
<p>In any case, I knew it wasn't happening. Better to close things up and remind myself why God invented hand lotion. Hell, at the very least, I was pretty sure Ashley would be willing to watch. For a man as lonely as me, that counted as getting some.</p>
<p>Kristen dealt the second to last hand. Kate took one look at her card and got up to go brush her teeth.</p>
<p>"I'll bet a kiss!" she called back to us from the bathroom. For my penultimate card, Kristen had dealt me a 7. Of course. I couldn't even get angry about it any more. It was the perfect card for such a flawed night.</p>
<p>Emma folded after me. She stood up and stretched, giving me one last look right up at her center. Fucking shit my sister had a great puss. I actually found myself regretting that I'd never get to see it again. Another great reason to end the night—I was already on my way to doing something significantly stupid.</p>
<p>Sam took a while to look at his card, then raised Kate's kiss to nudity. That was it then, Kate would either fold and call it a night or call and give the big winner his payment in the privacy of their bedroom.</p>
<p>Ashley dutifully folded. She crossed her arms over her chest. Goodnight amazing mammaries!</p>
<p>Finally, Kristen folded. I started to pick up the cards.</p>
<p>Kate came back from the bathroom, smelling minty fresh. She was still in just her bra and panties. God bless.</p>
<p>"Who's up?" she asked.</p>
<p>"You," I said.</p>
<p>"Cool, who do I have to kiss?"</p>
<p>"Actually, your boyfriend raised you."</p>
<p>"Oooo, he did, did he? Naughty little boy," Kate smirked, "OK babe, watcha got for me."</p>
<p>"He made it nudity," Ashley said, stifling a yawn. I looked at the clock. 11 pm. God, but it felt so much later than that.</p>
<p>Kate, clearly feeling playful, looked back down at her card. She held it up close, then looked over the edge at all of us.</p>
<p>I don't know what she was thinking at that moment. Maybe she wanted to turn the screws a little on Sam. He hadn't been on his best behavior in the game. Especially when it came to his treatment of Kate.</p>
<p>Maybe she wanted to give us all one last reminder that she was the one getting laid that night. And we weren't. That's a very Kate thing to do.</p>
<p>Heck, maybe she just felt like winning the last hand—having something to lord over everyone else for the rest of the vacation.</p>
<p>I honestly have no idea what Kate was thinking when she looked back up from her card and announced,</p>
<p>"I raise."</p>
<p>Everyone froze. We were all doing pre-sleep rituals: brushing teeth, picking out clothing for the morning, giving our hair one last brushing. We stopped still. Like Medusa had just walking into the room.</p>
<p>Sam stared up at Kate. He didn't exactly look surprised.</p>
<p>I've been in houses where the parents are getting divorced. Even if they're not fighting you can feel the tension. The whole house just buzzes with angry energy. I felt it at that moment. It made the back of my throat taste like bile.</p>
<p>"How about...a hand job," Katie said finally. She smiled at Sam. This would have been cute if it wasn't so upsetting.</p>
<p>"Call," Sam said.</p>
<p>He didn't even bother to look back at his card. We all turned back to Kate. It was like watching a tennis match. Or a remarkably tension-filled game of Pong.</p>
<p>"Ok, honey, you win," Kate said.</p>
<p>She did a little curtsey and then turned to leave. I started picking up cards and clearing glasses.</p>
<p>"What do you have?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, honey, it doesn't matter, does it?" Kate said, "Come to bed and I'll pay up."</p>
<p>She winked. The way Kate was acting, I could almost believe Sam was in for a fun night.</p>
<p>"What do you have?" Sam asked again.</p>
<p>He was still sitting on the floor, scrunched up against the wall.</p>
<p>"Fine," Kate said, "I had a 4, OK?"</p>
<p>"No you didn't. Don't do that. Don't pull that pity shit. I called your bet. Let me see your card."</p>
<p>Kate reached down and picked up her card. She showed us the four of hearts.</p>
<p>"See," Kate said, "you won."</p>
<p>Jack held up his Jack and then threw it to the ground. The corner bent a little when it hit. Oh well, time for new cards. Maybe I'd pick up some nice plastic ones on the way home, like they used in casinos or on TV.</p>
<p>"Great," Kate said, "You won, OK? Let's go to bed."</p>
<p>"Hang on," Sam said, "you have to get your punishment."</p>
<p>"Oh honey, jerking you off isn't a..."</p>
<p>"No. You're not jerking me off. You bet a hand job. I want to see a hand job," Sam said.</p>
<p>We were all drawn back to the circle, like being pulled into the spiral of a whirlpool.</p>
<p>"OK, honey," Kate said, like talking to a toddler, "Whatever you want. I don't really know the difference between jerking you off and a hand job but... Whatever you want. You win."</p>
<p>Sam stared straight ahead.</p>
<p>"It's my win. I get to set the rules. Isn't that right, Jason? That's how you set it up, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah man. That's how we set it up."</p>
<p>Kate looked at Sam, confused. We all did.</p>
<p>"Nudity," Sam said. Kate cocked an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"You bet nudity and you lost," he said, almost agitated.</p>
<p>"Oh," Kate smiled, "Of course you're right."</p>
<p>She popped up and started undoing her bra.</p>
<p>Sam, you magnificent bastard!</p>
<p>The hottest girl in the house was giving us one last look before calling it a night. Was Sam doing this to rub it in my face? To show everyone what, exactly, he was taking to bed every night? No doubt.</p>
<p>But whatever, man, his gain was my...also gain.</p>
<p>Kate let the black lacy cups of her bra fall away.</p>
<p>"Holy..." Ashley exclaimed under her breath.</p>
<p>When the woman with the world's most amazing breasts is in awe of your breasts? Dude that's saying something right there.</p>
<p>Kate's tits were legitimately, naturally enormous. Despite their size, they barely sagged at all. Her areola were large, matching the size of her chest. Large brown nipples crinkled forward, showing just the hint of arousal.</p>
<p>I noticed Emma hugging her arms to her chest, self-conscious. Even Kristen, no slouch in the size department herself, had a look on her face like she was an amateur golfer watching Tiger Woods for the first time.</p>
<p>We were all so transfixed by her boobs, we almost missed checking out the rest. Kate kicked off her lacy black panties. Her lips were nice and full. Her pink nubby peeked out from behind her labia, just begging to be sucked.</p>
<p>That bald little pussy was as pretty as any I'd ever seen. It was unfair, really. Kate was so beautiful. Did she need to have the world's sweetest looking snatch, as well?</p>
<p>The process of ending the game—the cleaning, the arguing—had left my little man feeling a bit down. After this display, he could have been used to knock down the doors of medieval castles he was so stiff. It was like every cock and clit and nipple in the room saw the amazing beauty that was before them and stood at attention in a show of admiration and respect.</p>
<p>Kate did a cute little twirl. Her shoulder length brown hair spun with her, landing slightly askew. She adorably tucked it behind her ear.</p>
<p>"Ready baby?" she asked.</p>
<p>Holy fuck. We were all ready. Holy fucking fuck.</p>
<p>"Now the rest," Sam said.</p>
<p>Kate looked down at herself, trying to figure out what she had forgotten to take off.</p>
<p>"No no no," Sam said, "the hand job."</p>
<p>"Oh! Right. Sorry baby," Kate said, "but wouldn't you rather we do it in our room instead of in front of all your friends?"</p>
<p>Sam just glared at her.</p>
<p>"OK. Hang on. Let me go get one of your condoms from the bedroom and I'll..."</p>
<p>"Not me," Sam said.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>OK, if we weren't already confused enough...</p>
<p>"It's my win. It's my rules. We all agreed."</p>
<p>"Well, of course, honey, but..."</p>
<p>"I don't want you to give me a hand job," Sam said.</p>
<p>"You want me to...I should...you want me to jerk of Jason?" Kate asked.</p>
<p>Oh shit.</p>
<p>That might have been the worst thing she could have said. I totally did not want that. I mean, OK, I totally did want that. But I didn't want it in a way that would be so completely humiliating to my best friend. And don't think he missed how suddenly eager she sounded when asking, either. Sam couldn't hold me responsible for something his girlfriend stupidly said, could he?</p>
<p>"No," Sam said, "I want you to give one to yourself."</p>
<p>He stood up and, grabbed one of the half-empty wine bottles lying around the living room. He took a deep swig, like he was in a Disney pirate movie. Then he set the bottle back on the table.</p>
<p>"Honey...you know I don't..."</p>
<p>"They're not my rules. You lost the bet. You have to pay up."</p>
<p>"I don't want to do that," Kate said. She held her ground.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to show everyone my cock. Krissy didn't want to kiss her best friend."</p>
<p>"But that's different. That's...Baby, you know I don't like to do that. It's...well, it's dirty," Katie said, quietly.</p>
<p>"Oh please. Really?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>"We talked about this," Kate chided her friend.</p>
<p>"Sure. Doesn't mean you get a free pass now."</p>
<p>"I had to kiss my best friend, on the lips," Kristen was close to tears now, "I'm going to hell because of this stupid game. I didn't get to back out. What makes you think you can?"</p>
<p>This was where Kate's beauty kind of backfired on her. Guys would absolutely let her get away with murder, but girls—even really super pretty girls—only resented her for it. If it had been Ashley or Emma or almost any other girl, they'd probably just let it go.</p>
<p>Heck, if Kate had just stayed dressed, the others might have just felt pity, or tired, and called it. But no. Kate had to show off. She had to shake her big perfect titties in everyone's faces. She had to twirl her pert little bottom. She took her 'get out of masturbating free' card and tossed it away.</p>
<p>Ashley walked over and gave Kristen a little squeeze around the shoulders. I should have been touched, but instead I found myself wishing Kristen would reach over and tweak Ashley's little perfect nipple in return.</p>
<p>"If it makes you feel any better," Ashley told Kristen quietly, "I think you only go to hell if you enjoyed it."</p>
<p>"Fuck. I really am going to hell, then," Kristen said. Ashley's jaw dropped.</p>
<p>"Christ, Kate. It's a little stroke session. You're not assassinating the pope. Could you please just rub one out so we can get to sleep?" Emma asked.</p>
<p>Like I said, she and Kate never really got along.</p>
<p>"Fine," Kate said. She grabbed one of the blankets from the couch and laid it on the floor.</p>
<p>"Y'know what? Fine. Assholes."</p>
<p>She lay down on the blanket and stared up at the ceiling. We all stood around her—like some strange Celtic ceremony or a really fucked up wake. I dimmed the lights. Somehow it felt at least a little less weird that way.</p>
<p>For a while Kate just lay there. Emma was about to say something but I shushed her. Then Kate slowly slid her right hand down, starting at her neck, over the mound of her breast and across her flat stomach, nestling her fingers where her pubic hairs would have been.</p>
<p>Very subtly, she dipped the tip of her finger inside herself, then brought it out. She smeared the liquid around her clit, like spreading a rub on a piece of steak before grilling it. Then she dipped back in again.</p>
<p>After going the well a few times, Kate was clearly getting into a groove. Her legs were now bent open, welcoming. Her hot little hole opened and closed, like it was gasping for air. But it didn't want oxygen. That gorgeous cunt was desperate for cock—a hungry little mouth searching, begging for something to satisfy her appetite.</p>
<p>Kate made a low groan. She just rubbed her clit now, back and forth, with her right hand. Her left was perched on her breast, rubbing in time with her right, pausing only occasionally to tweak her brown nipple.</p>
<p>The room smelled strongly of pussy and, strangely, cinnamon. Kate squeaked—, a gasp that caught in her throat. Her left hand raced down from her titty. She jammed a good two fingers inside her hungry puss.</p>
<p>Kate pumped her hand in and out. It made loud squelching sounds. She rubbed that little clitty for all it was worth. She started to tense. Her back started to arch. Then she made a frustrated noise and uncoiled.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>She switched hands—now strumming back and forth with her left and pumping with her right. Oh my God the urge to just jump in and give her a hand.</p>
<p>Holy fuck.</p>
<p>I was still naked. I hadn't even really thought about it, and now everyone could probably tell time using the shadow my stiff cock made over Kate's writing body. I reached down and gave myself a little squeeze. My whole body contracted with pleasure. A little clear fluid dripped out of my tip and splashed onto Kate's thigh. She hardly noticed. I stopped touching my cock.</p>
<p>Kate made another loud, frustrated groan and then switched hands again. She was doing all four fingers now, just stuffing them in there while her right hand was a blur moving back and forth.</p>
<p>She was panting heavily. All of us were. I felt a little shiver, even though it was perfectly warm.</p>
<p>"Ahhhh," Kate let out a long low whine, somewhere on the edge of pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ashley knelt down beside her rising, writhing friend. She rested her hand on Kate's knee.</p>
<p>"Come on, Katie," Ashley said soothingly, "you can get there."</p>
<p>"Oh God..." Kate moaned.</p>
<p>"It's ok, baby. I'm here. You can get there, I know you can."</p>
<p>"Sssoo good," Kate moaned.</p>
<p>"I know baby. I know. You can get there, Katie bear. I know you can. Don't you want to show me how you cum? Show me how you cum, baby. Show me how good it is. I know you want to baby. I know you want me to see you cum. Come on little Katie bear, you can do it, baby."</p>
<p>Kate kept rubbing. Kept pumping. All we heard was our own breathing and squish, squish, squish.</p>
<p>"Ohhhh," Kate moaned.</p>
<p>"Do you want my help, baby?" Ashley asked, squeezing her friend's knee.</p>
<p>"No, no. I'm OK. I'm OK. I'm...Oh God...Oh...I'm almost there."</p>
<p>"OK, baby," Ashley smiled. Her cute little curls bounced in motion with Kate's body. Her beautiful little tits swayed back and forth. I didn't think her nipples could get any harder. Holy fuck could they get any harder?</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kate froze.</p>
<p>It was almost the same "oh!" Kristen made the first time she saw my cock.</p>
<p>Kate streeeetched back, arching her head back toward her bottom. Her legs—those amazing long, tan legs—snapped closed on her hands like a bear trap.</p>
<p>"Guuuhhhhohhhhohhhh," she howled. Her whole body shook. Then slowly she bent forward again. She rolled onto her side.</p>
<p>"Oh. Oh. Oh," she made little tremors with each exclamation. Then her breathing slowed, Her muscles started to untwine. Then suddenly, *snap* she was back to being clenched tight in the fetal position.</p>
<p>"Ohhhhhhhhh," the aftershocks of her orgasm just leaked out of her.</p>
<p>"Oh, so good. So fucking good. Oh God, so fucking good. So fucking good," she just kept repeating over and over again, lying on the floor. Shuddering. Shaking.</p>
<p>Ashley crawled over, brushed the sweaty hair from Kate's face and kissed her, full and clear right on the lips.</p>
<p>"You did so good, little Katie bear," Ashley said, lovingly.</p>
<p>"Uh huh," Kate agreed.</p>
<p>"So good," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"Holy shit that was hot," Emma said, as if she had forgotten she wasn't alone.</p>
<p>Emma's fingers were still dipped under the waistband of her little purple panties. The clarity in her eyes told me she hadn't cum.</p>
<p>On the far side of Kate's prone body, Kristen was positively fidgety. She kept moving her hands around. First they were up, then they clasped each other, then they were crossed across her chest, then back down again. She wasn't saying anything, but she was saying everything.</p>
<p>I don't know what Sam expected to happen, but it certainly wasn't this. His face was bright red, his hands balled in fists. Maybe he thought she'd chicken out. Or she wouldn't be able to get there. Who knows? But he was really, very, dangerously upset.</p>
<p>This most private, amazing, beautiful thing Kate could do—she wouldn't share it with him, but she share with all his friends. He might have been happier hearing she was doing someone behind his back. This was so...public. Right in front of him. He was breathing almost as heavily as his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Kate slowly stood with Ashley's help. Don't think I didn't notice Ashley giving her friend's boob a little squeeze on the way up. Hell, I couldn't blame her.</p>
<p>Weak-kneed, Kate slowly limped back toward the bathroom. She clenched and unclenched the fingers of her right hand.</p>
<p>"Wow," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"That was..." Kristen started, then drifted off.</p>
<p>"That was amazing," I said.</p>
<p>"Crazy," Emma said.</p>
<p>"Wild," Ashley agreed.</p>
<p>Sam said nothing.</p>
<p>I bent down and slowly, reluctantly, started to roll up Kate's blanket. Little beads of girl cum were still drying on the fabric. I wanted to sniff them all up. Maybe roll around in her essence for a while. Use the blanket to jerk off. Hell, maybe I'd marry the thing it was so fucking hot. Fortunately cooler heads prevailed.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Kate asked, standing in the corridor.</p>
<p>We all looked up. She was still completely naked, still flexing her right hand. She had a q-tip in her left, cleaning out her ears, which was actually kind of bizarre.</p>
<p>"What?" Kristen asked, almost afraid.</p>
<p>"I didn't just do...that for everyone to just quit," Kate said, "It's like...what did you say before, Sammy? Etiquette. That's what it is."</p>
<p>She sauntered over to the circle and plopped her cute little bottom back down. Everyone slowly migrated back to the circle.</p>
<p>We really are monkeys, y'know? We made an assault on Kate's primacy and she beat us all back. No one was going to disagree with our new pack leader now.</p>
<p>We all sat down. I shuffled the cards. Kate clapped her hands together and giggled. Her perfect boobies jiggled along with her—she may as well have just stuck them in our faces.</p>
<p>"So whose deal is it?" Kate asked.</p>
<p>"Yours, actually," I said.</p>
<p>"Oh goody!" Kate declared and took the cards. She gave them a lazy little shuffle and then distributed the deck.</p>
<p>I looked down at a measly three. Different deal, same shit. I folded, then got up to mix more drinks. Clearly I was doing it wrong—everyone should have been completely passed our or stone cold sober by now. At least Emma was out of weed.</p>
<p>Emma bet her bra. Sam folded, as did Ashley. Kristen just smooth called the bra. I came back with everyone's drinks and handed them out.</p>
<p>"Ooo, little strong there, big bro," Emma said.</p>
<p>"Naked bartender, naked alcohol," I said.</p>
<p>"Ok, then," Emma said. She put her glass down like it was radioactive.</p>
<p>"Me?" Kate asked, looking up from her card.</p>
<p>"Yup," Emma answered, impatiently.</p>
<p>"What was the bet?" Kate asked.</p>
<p>"I bet bra. Kristen called. Everyone else folded," Emma said.</p>
<p>"I see," Kate smiled from behind her card. Uh oh.</p>
<p>"Well then," Kate said, "Fuck."</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Kristen asked, actually concerned.</p>
<p>"No that's my bet," Kate said, "I'm calling your little undies bet and raising you a fuck."</p>
<p>"That's...that's ridiculous," Kristen stammered, "girls can't fuck."</p>
<p>"You better bet they can," Ashley replied.</p>
<p>Kristen made a face like she'd been eating chocolate, only to be told she was actually chewing on a turd. Horrified, disgusted, frightened—all at once.</p>
<p>"So, if we call...and we win..." Emma sounded it out.</p>
<p>"Then I'll fuck you. Or I'll fuck whoever you choose. Whatever. And if you lose..."</p>
<p>"No, I get it," Emma said, "My card isn't that good. I fold."</p>
<p>"What a shame," Kate said, "Kristen?"</p>
<p>If Sam was surprised by this turn of events, he didn't show it. I guess you can't break a mule's back twice. Once he was gone, he was gone gone.</p>
<p>"No thanks," Kristen said. I took the deck from Kate and started to shuffle.</p>
<p>"Nuh uh uh," Kate waggled her finger.</p>
<p>She pointed at Emma's chest and made a little twirl with her hand.</p>
<p>"Oh right," Emma said, "Sorry."</p>
<p>She stood and reached back to undo her little white bra.</p>
<p>As I said before, Ashley's tits were perfect. Nobody was beating Ashley's tits. Nobody. But holy fuck did my little Emmy's breasties come close.</p>
<p>They were about the size of a large, ripe peach and just as pink and fresh and juicy looking. Her little pink nips sat near the top of each, like little cherries on top of perfect little peachy sundaes. Her nipples were hard as all fuck, of course—so long and bright and stiff she could have rented them out as safety equipment for nighttime highway construction crews.</p>
<p>"Nice," Ashley said, smiling.</p>
<p>Emma pinched one hard nipple and winked, then sat down. Even Kate looked impressed.</p>
<p>That was my sister! My little sister. My baby little sis. I could not would not should not even be looking at her amazing, gravity defying, boob-osity. But there it was and there I sat—dumbfounded.</p>
<p>If Em's boobs had shocked the room like my cock had before, then poor Kristen's chest got the Sam treatment, which wasn't really fair. She had a superior rack—second biggest in the room—full and beautiful with nice pink nipples that were clearly happy to meet everyone. A lot of rooms, those are the best breasts they've ever seen. This group? They hardly merited a mention.</p>
<p>But the sexiest thing—honestly truly maybe one of the sexiest things I'd seen all night—wasn't when Kristen exposed her boobs, but rather when she covered them again. As she sat back down, clearly feeling a little ashamed, her impossibly long curtains of hair streamed down her back, over her shoulders, and across her chest, making her beautiful big boobies nearly disappear behind a cascade of golden goodness.</p>
<p>Mermaid hair.</p>
<p>Her hair was so long it completely covered her chest, save for just the smallest hint of underboob. Like a mermaid in a painting. I'm not sure I'm giving this the justice it deserves. You have to trust me, it was amazing. Really super sexy. I just wanted to push back that hair, reach my hands up and...</p>
<p>"Jason?"</p>
<p>Emma snapped me out of my stupor.</p>
<p>"You ok, big bro?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Yeah I'm fine."</p>
<p>"Or should I say extra super big long and hard big bro?" Emma asked, looking coyly at my cock.</p>
<p>"No no," I said, a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>"OK then. Well it's your deal, thick, beautiful, probably tasty big bro."</p>
<p>"She's going to keep doing that isn't she," I said.</p>
<p>"That's what you have to be hoping for," Ashley said. She winked.</p>
<p>"Ha ha," I said. I dealt the cards.</p>
<p>The next hand, Sam was in but everyone dropped out. The hand after, Kate cried "fuck" again and everyone folded. She'd found a cute little trick, that one, and it was working as well as anything we'd seen so far. It was an all-in above all other all-ins—no one was going to call and Kate knew it.</p>
<p>But, curiously, whenever Sam was in, Kate chose not to make her winning move. Was she really worried that she might have to fuck the same guy she fucked every other weekend? Or was she concerned that Sam might have another cruel punishment for her if she lost?</p>
<p>Despite that one blind spot, Kate was able to strip her opponents down to nothing. Ashely's thong went first, revealing...well, not much that we hadn't already seen. That thong was really revealing. I was totally entranced by Ashley's pretty blonde pubes, though. I could see why she wouldn't shave them.</p>
<p>Kristen and Emma went only a few hands further.</p>
<p>First Kristen pulled out a pretty little peach of a pussy—her parts all nicely tucked in under a surprisingly thick shock of blonde pubes.</p>
<p>"Geez girl, shave ever?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>"Shut up. You're not exactly baby smooth, either," Kristen snapped. Go girl! Stand up for yourself!</p>
<p>"I'm not rebuilding the Amazonian rainforest between my legs," Ashley retorted.</p>
<p>"Just let it go, would you?" Emma broke it up. Her own reveal was soon to follow.</p>
<p>Again, we had pretty much seen it all through her panties. Emma had a really nice snatch. Her pubes were trimmed down to almost a minimum—probably for all her sports stuff (my baby sis wasn't fucking. Was she?). Her labia were pretty and plump with a bit of an oversized clit (it must run in the family) that hung down lazily between her little lippies. It was also juicy as all hell—big droplets of thick, clear fluid soaked her pubes, ran down her legs and dripped onto the floor. Her legs were practically shiny with it.</p>
<p>Poor girl, her panties hadn't been covering her up, so much as stanching her flow. Now she was just dripping everywhere. She did her best to cover it with her hands, but holy fuck that wasn't helping anything except my erection.</p>
<p>Sam, till now just sitting under a dark, angry cloud, seemed transfixed by how greased up Emma's little pussy had gotten.</p>
<p>"Are you always this way?" I asked, concerned.</p>
<p>"I've always been a little bit...I dunno, lubricated, I guess?" Emma confessed, her hands still collecting the liquid from her puss.</p>
<p>"Easy to start, hard to stop, lots in between," Emma said, "but like this? No. Never."</p>
<p>"OK," I said, "Well let me know if there's anything I can do, alright."</p>
<p>"Sure, just take that wonderful cock of yours, plug me up and pound me till I'm filled with thick, sticky big brother cum. Sound good?"</p>
<p>"Emmy you know I can't..."</p>
<p>Holy shit. She was joking, right? She had to have been joking.</p>
<p>"What are you two whispering about over there?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing," I said quickly.</p>
<p>"Well then shut up and let's play," Ashley said. Very well then. My little lamp was jealous of the other appliances—apparently the faucet, in particular.</p>
<p>When the round was done, everyone was stark naked. Even Sam lost his boxers on an ill-advised bet against Ashley. Unlike everyone else who tossed our ill-gotten clothes off to the side, Ashley carried Sam's boxers as a kind of a trophy. She went around sniffing them in front of anyone who was willing to watch.</p>
<p>It wasn't sweet revenge, I was sure. Maybe stinky revenge? It hardly mattered Sam was so torn between horrible embarrassment and incredible arousal he was almost literally spinning around the room.</p>
<p>The last round, despite being such a loss for all involved, was actually a good cleanser from some of the darker stuff we'd been doing to each other. We were all naked, after all. All pretty much in the same place. It was hard to be too worked up about anything.</p>
<p>I mixed more drinks. People stood around and stretched and surreptitiously checked each other out.</p>
<p>"Wow, Sam has a really nice ass," Emma whispered to me behind the kitchen counter.</p>
<p>"You should tell him that," I said, "he could use the boost right about now."</p>
<p>Emma thought about it.</p>
<p>"Nah. I don't want him getting any wrong ideas."</p>
<p>I looked at her, suspiciously. What exactly was a wrong idea at this party? Was that even a possible thing at this point?</p>
<p>"You seriously don't know how two girls would fuck?" Ashley asked Kristen. Ashley seemed to have invented a new game that she and she alone could play called "make the naïve super-Christian girl blush." Ashley was a champion at it.</p>
<p>"No," Kristen protested, "they don't have the right...parts."</p>
<p>"Oh my god," Ashley laughed, despite herself, "Look, after this is over, come back with me to my place and I'll show you some pictures, OK?"</p>
<p>"I don't know if that would be such a good idea," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"Atta girl," Ashley said, "now you're learning."</p>
<p>"But I still don't..."</p>
<p>"You don't really have a boyfriend, do you?" Ashley asked, eyeing her, "You just said that because you don't want to look like a loser, right?"</p>
<p>"Of course I have a boyfriend," Kristen said, "I met him at church. He's so so sweet and super handsome..."</p>
<p>"He must have the bluest balls on the planet," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"Nope," I interjected, "that'd be me."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry," Ashley said, rubbing my bare shoulder, "we're all gonna take care of that soon enough."</p>
<p>She walked off to go sit down by the fireplace. I froze in place. Stunned. What did she mean by 'take care of that.' Wait. What did she mean by 'all?'</p>
<p>Holy fucking shit.</p>
<p>"Hey bro, quit standing there and get back to the game!" Emma called out to me, "standing there in the middle of the room, you look like a big dumb lamp!"</p>
<p>Well there ya go.</p>
<p>"Super big 'on' switch, though," Ashley called out.</p>
<p>"Yeah, couldn't miss it!" Kate chimed in.</p>
<p>Next round. Rules stayed the same. Nothing changed. Everything changed.</p>
<p>It was one of those unintended consequences things.</p>
<p>Before now, the game was all about clothing. Emma still had her bra. Ashley still had panties. You couldn't see Kristen's boobs or Sam's cock. Why was Ashley less naked than I was? If I had to show everyone my bush, then Emma sure as hell was taking her titties out.</p>
<p>My little ratings game played right into that. I could spend all day thinking about what I'd seen so far and what I might see later. But now I had my final standings: Best Hair, Kristen. Best Eyes, Em. Best mouth, Kate. Best boobs, Ashley. Best hands, Ashley. Best pussy, Em. Best ass, Sam (not my opinion per se, but whatever) Best legs, Kristen. Best feet, Em. Best body, Kate.</p>
<p>Kate was like the movie that loses every Oscar but wins Best Picture. Sometimes, A- material comes together in a way that makes A+ movie. Are you really gonna argue against that?</p>
<p>But now that everyone was ranked, there really wasn't much for me to obsess over. We were all naked. Sitting around playing cards. It was probably at least midnight. Maybe a little later.</p>
<p>None of us saw it coming.</p>
<p>The first deal, everyone seemed super tentative. Our baseline bet was gone. If your card was a little interesting, you couldn't just throw out a piece of clothing. No one had any more clothing to bet.</p>
<p>Four hands in, nothing was happening. Maybe this was it? Maybe this was how the evening ended. Not with a bang, but a whimper. Then Kristen dealt, and for the first time—hallelujah, heaven be praised—I had a hand. Queen of hearts. Nothing amazing, but after a steady diet of gruel, oatmeal tastes fucking fantastic.</p>
<p>Kate, bless her, made a baseline little kiss bet. I had no idea what that meant about her hand. I guessed it was a card that was too good fold, but not so good to take a risk on. I put her on a jack, which would mean I had her beat.</p>
<p>I was so cold decked, so blue balled, the thought of just a kiss was almost worse than nothing at all. But I had the leading card, right? So why play for a little relief? Plus who knows who might jump in, I could be getting some from every girl in the room.</p>
<p>I reraised to a hand job. Worst is, I'm fingering someone. I could totally, definitely live with that.</p>
<p>Emma and Sam both folded. Ashley seemed to consider, but then let it go. Kristen folded as well, and I started to think I'd over bet my only chance of the night.</p>
<p>We were playing a real game here. There were real stakes. Friendships, relationships, hell families—it was all in there right now. It wasn't something we planned on doing, but here we were. And though we knew it would probably end us, we couldn't stop pushing further.</p>
<p>Kate looked at her card, then looked at me. I knew I was getting eyed and I did my best to look elsewhere. You know what they say, if you feel nervous, just pretend everyone around you is naked.</p>
<p>I really needed that hand job. My balls felt so bad; every time they bounced against each other I worried they would spark the whole house ablaze. Kate might not even have to touch me—she'd call my bet and I'd cum all over the carpet.</p>
<p>"OK, bestie," Kate said, using her little pet name for me, "I'll call."</p>
<p>I didn't cum.</p>
<p>I just turned over my queen. She showed a jack. Wow. I'd actually guessed right. That was awesome!</p>
<p>Oh my god!</p>
<p>I was gonna get a hand job from my high school crush girl! That was so so so much awesomer!</p>
<p>"Why don't you sit up on a chair so all of us can see," Ashley suggested. Dirty little lamp.</p>
<p>The hard wood of the chair was a little chilly, but my cock wasn't flagging now—not for an ice queen, let alone a little chill.</p>
<p>Oh god oh god oh god oh god. I felt like a little boy going on his first ride at Disney World. Only it was a hand job from my high school crush, so it was like...best ride ever?</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>"I'll go get a condom, hon," Sam said reluctantly, "I know Jason didn't bring any."</p>
<p>That was...oddly gracious. Hey hon, while you jack off another dude, I'm just gonna make coffee. You both want cream and sugar?</p>
<p>And then, on an evening of exceptionally weird events, Kate whipped out the weirdest.</p>
<p>"It's ok, hun," Kate replied as she knelt down to get a good angle on my cock, "I don't need one. It's just a handy."</p>
<p>Sam looked ready to just fall over. He was lost somewhere between absolute shock and incredible nausea. His face was a little green. His cock bobbed about, like it was directing the Philharmonic.</p>
<p>I went from excited to over the moon. A 'handy' from my high school bestie. No condom needed. This ride was looking even better. Hello Space Mountain!</p>
<p>"OK," Kate said, "lets set the timer."</p>
<p>"Wait, what?" I suddenly sat up, shocked.</p>
<p>"I'm not gonna just kneel here and work you over until you go," Kate said.</p>
<p>"But you..."</p>
<p>"If we do it that way every time this game will go till morning."</p>
<p>I wanted to point out that it probably already had, but I was so set back I couldn't get the words out of my mouth.</p>
<p>"Minute should be good," Kate said, "just give him the feel of it."</p>
<p>She smirked, wickedly. I couldn't tell if she was enjoying my misery or actually thought she was being sexy.</p>
<p>Emma set the timer on her phone. I watched her press start, then completely lost track. Kate grabbed my member in her able hands.</p>
<p>I was so close, I thought, I doubted I'd last a minute, anyway. Kate's long fingers and cute pink fingernails looked so sexy wrapped around my cock Her skin wasn't that pale, but it still looked stark in comparison to my engorged, purple penis.</p>
<p>She had a nice, tight grip—no tentative handles here—and the heat as her hand embraced my staff almost made me slide right off the chair. I looked into her eyes as she slowly worked the loose skin of my shaft up and over my engorged head. Those big blue beautiful eyes. The ones I'd stared into for so long with a want she never seemed to recognize, let alone understand.</p>
<p>She started long and slow. Like she was warming up my engine. Gradually gaining speed. Her beautiful, bountiful breasts bounced with every stroke. Oh, sweet lord let me cum right onto those amazing mounds, I prayed. As she worked me, her head moved closer and closer to my cock. Her mouth hung right over him. Her little pink tongue curled out in concentration. My penis prickled in the warmth of her breath. Oh, sweet lord, forget my last request and just let her slide me into that amazing mouth!</p>
<p>Then it all went wrong. Her grip, so pleasingly tight at first, was too tight. It wasn't so much a 'handy' as it was a 'strangly.' Her rhythm was off, too, in a weird way that I wouldn't have thought possible. Somehow it stopped my member from signaling my balls to bring forth the troops.</p>
<p>Poor Kate. She really was trying. She was used to grabbing a cock through a condom, which was very different. She was used to the guy finishing himself off. Now she was kind of at a loss for how to make that happen.</p>
<p>Emma's phone alarm went off ("Frankie Says Relax" if you can believe it. Fucking shit, even Apple was against me). Kate stopped stroking. I felt more like I'd been through an industrial accident than the happiest place on earth.</p>
<p>My cock was mangled and my balls just ached. They had gone from blue to purple to some sickly orange. My hard on now stretched ever more painfully outward. Girls joke about a guy being so hard he must be lightheaded. I no longer considered that a joke. I felt like I needed to eat a sugar cookie and drink a glass of OJ before I could continue the game.</p>
<p>I sat back on the floor with a groan.</p>
<p>"If it helps, that was really fucking hot," Emma told me.</p>
<p>"I'm glad," I said.</p>
<p>"Nice, right?" Sam smiled at me. I gave him a weak, little thumbs up. I was gonna be outside, dry humping the mast before the day was done.</p>
<p>The next hand was back to its old tricks with a stupid little 6.</p>
<p>Emma bet a kiss. Ashley re-raised to a hand job.</p>
<p>We had a whole new game on our hands.</p>
<p>We didn't bother to break when the deal came back around. Stuff had gotten way too interesting to stop now. Meet the new game. Not exactly the same as the old game. It was the 'naked, fondling, stroking but no cumming, poker-esque experience.'</p>
<p>First hand in the next round ended with Emma betting, and winning a breast touch from Ashley. I think Em was hoping to get her hands on Ash's Amazing MammariesTM (Patent pending. All rights reserved), but really, this could hardly be called a disappointment.</p>
<p>Ashley slid over and sat behind my sister. She lowered her pretty little hands and started kneading Emma's perfect little peaks. Ashley started gradually, then moved to a full on squeeze and roll with plenty of nipple stim mixed in. I could not not look.</p>
<p>"You've got a little drool on you," Ashley chastised me. I did my best to pretend I was ashamed.</p>
<p>"Oh God," Emma moaned, "how'd you get so good at this?"</p>
<p>"I've had a little practice," Ashley said, smiling.</p>
<p>"You can go ahead and deal," Ashley told Sam, "this might be a while and I don't want to hold things up."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but notice no one was using a timer this time. Fuckity fuckity fuck.</p>
<p>While Emma's peaches ripened under Ashley's ministrations, Kate won herself a back massage from Kristen. Not the dirtiest of requests, but you would hardly notice from the way Kate moaned and groaned.</p>
<p>Kristen was studying to be an athletic trainer. It showed.</p>
<p>Emma's breast rub over, Ashley won the next hand and, lo and behold, Sam finally won a hand job of his own. I was pleased to see the timer was implemented once again. It turned out to be barely necessary.</p>
<p>Ashley gave Sam more of a hand tease than a hand job. A lot of tracing and stroking and fondling, that probably felt amazing but didn't really get him anywhere. After Frankie said "Relax," Sam was solidly worked up, but nothing more.</p>
<p>I was happy for my friend. He wanted some action and he had gotten some. And, honestly, I have to admit it was hot watching Ashley administer her hand worship to Sam's stem.</p>
<p>Hopefully it helped him feel a little better about how things were going. Lord knows all this teasing wasn't helping me.</p>
<p>I was done. That was it. My friend—in a long-term relationship and now on an epic losing streak—still got to fool around with more women than me. Hell, even the born again Christian girl had tongued more women than I had that evening.</p>
<p>It just wasn't my night. Whatever. I'd played enough poker to know when I was running bad. I'd lost enough poker to know I needed to quit when the cards were like this. Resigned, I looked down at my card.</p>
<p>An Ace.</p>
<p>Ace! It looked so pretty, I almost wept.</p>
<p>Praise the sweet spaghetti monster, I was back in business!</p>
<p>It was Kate's deal, which meant I was first to act. It also meant I had no idea what anyone else was holding. If I bet too big, I'd scare everyone else away and end up with nothing. If I bet too small, I might end up missing out on something really fun.</p>
<p>Did I want to just yell, "make me cum!" and pray for someone to call? You betcha. But at this point a little bit of something was so much better than a whole lot of nothing.</p>
<p>So, I went low risk and bet a boob touch, but it folded around anyway. Geez, was even that too much to ask? Then it got to Kristen and, miracle of miracles, she called.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what she was up to. Maybe this was her low-risk bet. Some harmless fondling with her best friend's bro probably felt like going all the way in the safest way possible. Maybe it was late and she was a little drunk. Maybe she thought Kate was certain to raise. To be honest, I'm not sure what she was thinking.</p>
<p>Kate folded.</p>
<p>I showed my Ace.</p>
<p>Kristen didn't even bother to show her card. She just sighed and started to pull her hair back so I could have better access to her chest.</p>
<p>"No no no," I said, stopping her. She let her hair fall back again. She seemed confused.</p>
<p>I scooched over so I was sitting in front of her—both of us were cross-legged. I looked her right in the eyes—two big oceans of deep dark stormy blue. I watched as she tried to search me. Confused? A little scared? Without really thinking about it, a made a little shushing sound as I raised up my hands.</p>
<p>"Timer?" someone asked. There was a hiss of dismissal from someone else.</p>
<p>I slid my fingers up and through Kristen's beautiful blonde cascades, letting the cool smooth strands just rush past my palms and around my wrists. Lightly, I brushed each bit of underboob, my hands still drowning in hair.</p>
<p>"Oo!" Kristen squeaked as I made contact. I guess my hands were a little cold. I caught her eyes again with mine. She did her best to settle her breathing back.</p>
<p>I traced the warm undersides of each breast, then slowly ran my fingers up the sides of her enormous tits, around to the tops then back again, making little teasing, spiraling circles around her pale, freckled mounds. I left her nipples untouched and wanting.</p>
<p>Kristen's eyes searched mine. More scared and excited now. I realized that most of the room couldn't see what I was doing. My hands were buried beneath Kristen's long blonde locks. It felt intimate. Close. We were sharing something forbidden between just the two of us.</p>
<p>As I spiraled around, I felt Kristen's back arch just a little—trying to press her pink nubbins up into my palms. Her eyes went tight, urgent with need.</p>
<p>Very gradually I let my fingertips find the softer skin of her areola. I brushed over her taut little nips.</p>
<p>Kristen gasped like she had been dunked in ice water—surprise, fear, and a bucket-full of adrenaline. She broke eye contact, tilted her head back, pushed her breasts forward into my hands.</p>
<p>I gave each nipple a little rub and pinch. Just lightly. Then I went back to tracing my circles. Slowly I wrapped my hands around each amazing globe, holding them in the palms of my hands.</p>
<p>Her breasts were warm—an enchanting mix of soft and tight. I felt her little nippies scrape my palms. Begging for attention. I caressed around each full tit and gave a nice firm, squeeze. They were so big, they spilled out the sides of my hands—I couldn't hold them all.</p>
<p>Slowly I set about massaging her extraordinary orbs—big full rubs of each one, every now and again shifting position so that my thumbs brushed over her stiff pink nipples.</p>
<p>Kristen's eyes were back on mine again. We both sort of just drifted into each other. She looked calm, content, at peace. In wonder. A little smile danced across her lips, and I couldn't help but do the same. She leaned forward a little, not with her chest but with her mouth.</p>
<p>Her cute pink lips just slid toward mine. I tilted my head to meet her.</p>
<p>"OK guys, I think that's enough," Kate declared.</p>
<p>"Yeah, guys, geez," Emma said, nervously. I noticed her hand cupped around her cute little mound.</p>
<p>I slowly pulled away, letting Kristen's hair drift back over me again. Her chest was flushed pink from the tops of her tits to all the way up her neck to the tops of her cheeks. She was panting like we'd been running, not rubbing.</p>
<p>I felt a hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>"Time for a break?" Kate asked.</p>
<p>"Sure," I said, still a little lost, "Sure."</p>
<p>The break may have helped me and Kristen cool down a little (and maybe Emma, too. I tried not to notice but my baby sis was clearly a little worked up), but it did nothing to chill my cards. My luck was coming back around, baby!</p>
<p>So of course, at that moment, Kate announced,</p>
<p>"Last round guys!"</p>
<p>There were a few groans but, honestly, it was hard to argue. The clock said 2am. We still had tomorrow to play again. Also, we'd drunk so much that night already; I was starting to worry about alcohol poisoning.</p>
<p>After some (honestly not that serious) cajoling, everyone agreed. We settled down for one last round of "sexy, naked, softcore, betting game."</p>
<p>Since it was the last round, I resolved to not let things get too outta hand. Sam and Kate were probably done, but that wasn't changing no matter what happened now. The rest of us could all still go to bed feeling fairly good about ourselves. Plenty of time to light everything on fire tomorrow.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>First deal, Sam tossed out a hand job. Emma called. The thought of seeing my sister stroke Sam's cock made me upset. I threw my body (kinda literally, actually) in front of it and forced everyone to fold.</p>
<p>I know—it was a dick move. I had relegated touching my sister to absolute no-no territory, but that didn't give me permission to stop other dudes from doing it. But just picturing her grasping his thin, pale penis made me feel all tingly and weird. I could only imagine how I'd feel if I actually had to watch it go down. Plus, after a whole evening of getting cock-blocked by a bunch of playing cards, I guess I just felt like being a dick.</p>
<p>Absolute pornographic power corrupts absolutely, apparently.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I had started to compile a new "best of" list—probably something I'd only be able to complete the following evening. This one was a little more interesting than best body parts. We had best hand job (Ashley), best boob rub (me!), best oral (to be determined). It was fun to fantasize about who might win each category, what techniques they might use—in that way it was almost just like deducting who had what hand.</p>
<p>For instance, I was sure that Ashley probably sucked cock in a perfectly, perfunctory way, that Kristen would be a disaster of awkwardness and teeth, but that Em would probably be the perfect combination of enthusiasm and skill.</p>
<p>Not that I was imagining a blow job from my sister. Never.</p>
<p>Next hand I had a queen. With this being the last round and all, I decided it was time to take one more big risk. I would be one of the last to act, too, giving me a bit of an advantage. I could pick my spot.</p>
<p>Sam, Ashley, Kristen and Kate were all in for a hand job and I could see Sam's mouth was watering with the possibilities. Everyone was in the hand so far. In poker, they call that a family pot. That...was not a term I felt like using during our little evening's sexcapade.</p>
<p>It looked like we were on our way to our first, full on orgy time. It also made one hell of an opportunity for me. I took the appropriate dramatic pause and announced,</p>
<p>"Dry hump."</p>
<p>"Whoah! Big bet, big bro!" Emma exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Nice," Ashley smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"No thanks," Sam said and dumped his card.</p>
<p>"I'll see that," Ashley said. She wasn't kidding—one way or another, she was gonna be seeing it. Doing it, too if I was lucky.</p>
<p>"What's a dry hump?" Kristen asked.</p>
<p>Kate groaned in disbelief. I thought Kristen's naiveté was kind of arousing, actually, but I could see how it might get old. Especially if you thought Kristen was full of shit, which Kate clearly did.</p>
<p>Ashley, Kristen's guide to all things erotic, leaned over and whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Kristen exclaimed, "I'm cool with that."</p>
<p>I think we were all knocked back a bit by that response. Then Kristen looked back down at her card and twisted her lips in thought.</p>
<p>"Maybe next time," she declared, and folded.</p>
<p>"Yeah. No," Kate said and dropped her card.</p>
<p>Kate was in a weird spot—perfectly happy to put people in uncomfortable places, but no longer interested in serving herself. Out of all of us, she was the only one who had cum and that made her even harder to read.</p>
<p>Was she done for the night? Was she waiting to make a play on Ashley or maybe twist the knife on Emma? Was she looking for one last roll around with Sam? Was Sam even her boyfriend at this point? I couldn't figure it out. And I had better things to think about at the moment.</p>
<p>I turned over my queen.</p>
<p>"Well," I smiled, "I guess that means I'm on top?"</p>
<p>"Sorry buddy boy," Ashley said, showing a king, "not today."</p>
<p>Wow. Ashley really did want to see that. And do it, as well. Good for her. Even better for me!</p>
<p>We got Kate's cum blanket (that's how I would think of it forever more) and unrolled it back out in the middle of the floor. When Emma got up to make room for the blanket, we noticed she'd left a huge, wet dark spot where she had been sitting.</p>
<p>"Geez girl, if you've gotta piss then go. Don't just do it all over the carpet," Kate said.</p>
<p>Emma blushed bright pink from head to toe.</p>
<p>"She can't help it," Kristen said, defensive.</p>
<p>"Don't worry," Ashley said, "I think it's sexy as hell."</p>
<p>Emma blushed even pinker than I thought possible. She was Care Bear pink now.</p>
<p>"And so does Sam," Ashley smiled, pointing out Sam's pole. He tuned more of a cherry color.</p>
<p>Emma looked over at Sam and then at me and made sort of a sad face. She said something, but I didn't hear her.</p>
<p>Once the blanket was out I lay down on my back, my cock conspicuously not cooperating with the need to lie flat. Kate noticed and gave me a little wink. Little Jason liked that a whole heck of a lot and winked back—making a little bow as well.</p>
<p>Ashley stood over my knees, legs spread apart, like she was setting up for a gymnastics routine. Only, like, it was going to be the bestest gymnastics routine ever.</p>
<p>"OK, here's the deal," Ashley said, almost glaring at me, "this is my win so we do it my way. You lie there and you do not move."</p>
<p>I just nodded.</p>
<p>"No touching, no tasting, no thrusting, not any of it. Understood?"</p>
<p>"Got it."</p>
<p>"And get your arms up and out of the way," Ashley commanded. I raised my arms up parallel with my shoulders, like forming a giant T. Or preparing for a crucifixion.</p>
<p>"Wow bro, you've been getting a lot of good stuff," Sam said, standing over me. I heard what he was really saying: You're getting a lot of good stuff and I'm not. But whatever. He had his run of luck and now it was my turn. What was I supposed to do, feel bad about it?</p>
<p>Ashley slowly bent her thin, pink legs and lowered herself down. Without touching me, she sort of tipped forward then, supporting herself with her hands, flat on the floor. Like she was going to do a push up. The best pushup e...</p>
<p>Oh. I already did that joke. Sorry.</p>
<p>Ashley's pretty pale blue eyes gave me a once over, conspicuously skipping my own hazel orbs. Then very carefully, she lowered herself down till her body rested on mine. Her crotch landed right above my cock, so that her mound was pressed into my pubis and nowhere near my desperate, desperate dick.</p>
<p>She was plenty short though, and it meant her amazing, fabulous, wondrous breasts were crushed ever so nicely into my chest. It was indescribable—her warm body resting on to mine. I felt it rise and fall with her breath. My arms begged to reach down, wrap around her warmth, press her flesh to mine, stretch out and squeeze her little buns. I ignored them.</p>
<p>Ashley just stayed there for a moment. Paused. For someone who had seemed so in control a moment ago, she seemed at a bit of a loss for what to do next.</p>
<p>I heard someone say something about starting a timer. I was so swallowed up in Ashley's body I didn't hear anything else.</p>
<p>Ashley pushed herself up a little bit with her arms and started dragging her body across mine. Up and back. Up and back. Head staring down at my chest. I found myself staring down at an explosion of little blonde curls.</p>
<p>As Ashley moved, she did everything she could to keep away from my cock, but otherwise she did a full run—gliding her sharp, needy nipples up my stomach and over my chest, tickling them through my coarse chest hair. She dragged her hot puss over the same spots, grinding her little clitty down as much as she could then up and over my chin, just skimming her wet, salty lips over mine. Her whole body grew more taut with every trip.</p>
<p>On the third go round, she slipped back a little further than before and I felt my shaft kind of bounce off the heat and hair of her opening. My member shifted from the contact, like it was trying to become prehensile and jam itself into her snatch. Instead it just bobbed there, stuck in place.</p>

<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>The next time down, her nipples pressing into me even harder, her bush rubbing ever deeper into my ribs, Ashley let the underside of my cock sort of get stuck between us. Then she draaaaggged her hot little cunt over it my member from root to head before going back upward.</p>
<p>"Holy shit, Ashley," I said as she ground into my member. She just giggled a little in response.</p>
<p>"Last one," she whispered to me as she passed. This time, as her chest crossed my face, she dangled her nipple at my mouth. She told me to give each a little kiss.</p>
<p>Holy fuck her tits were so perfect. I put my mouth over the nipple she offered, but rather than give it a kiss I kind of gummed it, giving it a wet little pinch with my mouth.</p>
<p>"Ah!" she gasped. I couldn't tell from surprise or pain or pleasure or what.</p>
<p>But she didn't even pause before giving me the right nip and letting me give it the same little love bite.</p>
<p>Then she straightened and I assumed that was the end of it. Neat. Kinda fun. Would def do that again.</p>
<p>Slowly, Ashley rolled her hips back, leaving a little trail of girl slime down my chest and stomach right into my pubes. She bent upward, like she was getting ready to ride me cowgirl, but, of course, she hadn't slipped onto my saddle.</p>
<p>Was she done? This didn't exactly seem like she was done.</p>
<p>Then very subtly, very gradually, in a way that was probably hard to see, Ashley started pressing her puss down onto my pubic bone—back and forth. Grinding that little clitty. Her tight little ass pressed my cock down at the root, as well. He wasn't getting much stimulation from all that rubbing, but frankly, he didn't need much.</p>
<p>With each frantic rub, Ashley slid herself slightly backward. She started off really rubbing herself on the tip of where my pubis met my stomach. Then she worked her way back rubbing the hairs themselves. Then the pointy tip of my pubic bone. Then the base of my cock. Then up and down the shaft. Then running the entire length of my swollen member—head to base. Back and forth. Ashley was rubbing her pretty pussy up and down my penis! Ashley was grinding her cunt on my hardness! Ashley was getting off on my cock! Alert! Alert! This is not a drill!</p>
<p>"Ohhhhhh, Ash," I moaned, "so good."</p>
<p>"Oh...oh yeah," she said. She had fallen back toward me now, her hands clasping my face, her perfect perfect titties scraping up and down my chest. She was really rubbing herself hard on me now. Just totally lost in getting off. Humming and grunting with every stroke. Each time, she slid back down, her hungry little hole tried its damndest to suck the head of my cock into its warm, wet tightness, but Ashley forced it back. Her thick pink nether lips embraced my shaft, holding on for dear life. I felt her wetness run down my cock, over my balls, right off my asshole.</p>
<p>I had seen this before. Had watched Ashley get herself off the previous night. Maybe she made a little more noise. Maybe her body moved a little bit more. But this was almost the same act. Rubbing, shaking, shivering, desperately working and focused on getting off without a sound or movement spared toward anything else. If breathing didn't get her to her climax, she'd stop breathing.</p>
<p>All this pressing and pushing had me so on edge. I could feel that her cum would be bathed in mine. Inside and out. The only reason I hadn't already gone was the mix of pain that came with the pleasure of her rubbing. The male organ just wasn't meant to be...squeezed out like it was tube of salty, white, baby-batter toothpaste. She was amazing, it felt incredible, but Ashley's movements were almost calculated to hold me back, to keep me contained until she could reach the finish line. After that, she would happily accept whatever came after.</p>
<p>She was getting close. Her movements more irregular. She went a little slower. A little faster. A little stutter halfway through. Finding the rhythm. Sliding back even further now. Pressing her clit against the head of my cock and drrrraaagging it all the way up. Where before her vulva had been content to just plant little kisses on my cock, now it seemed to be striving to suck me in. And Ashley seemed ready to give her aching puss exactly what it wanted.</p>
<p>Oh god.</p>
<p>She was backing up so slowly. Using her thin little legs to hold my cock in place. She was finally looking me in the eye, a queer little happy grin on her face. Oh god. She was sliding back. The head of my cock was touching her opening. Sliding forward. Did she not realize what she was doing? Was it by accident? How could she not feel my cock inching it's way inside of her. Oh god. It was on purpose. It had to be on purpose. Ashley was gonna fuck me. She was gonna thrust herself onto my cock, Bounce her perfect little tittties up and down. Cover each other with our cum.</p>
<p>Oh god.</p>
<p>Oh god.</p>
<p>I was almost in.</p>
<p>"Time!" Emma called.</p>
<p>Ashley and I both froze in place.</p>
<p>"Time, guys. That's time," Kristen said.</p>
<p>Kate put her hand on Ashley's shoulder and gently pulled her off me.</p>
<p>"Uuuuugggh," Ashley groaned as we separated, "You couldn't have waited like, five more seconds?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, girl, that was time," Emma told her.</p>
<p>"I was so close..." Ashley whined.</p>
<p>"I know, baby, it's ok," Kate said.</p>
<p>I just lay on the blanket like the corpse on an episode of Law and Order. Motionless and forgotten.</p>
<p>Finally, Sam reached his hand down to help me up.</p>
<p>"You ok, dude?"</p>
<p>I grasped his hand and let him pull me to my feet.</p>
<p>"I dunno," I said, honestly.</p>
<p>"That looked intense," he said.</p>
<p>"You have no idea."</p>
<p>"Well hopefully, soon, I will," he smiled, watching Ashley's tight little ass as it bobbled past us.</p>
<p>In that moment, somehow, I felt like we were back to being buds. That it didn't matter who went through what, we would stand by each other.</p>
<p>I felt very warm and safe in that moment.</p>
<p>"Damn right you will," I said.</p>
<p>Ashley was still fidgety as we started the next hand. She kept subtly rubbing her center up and back on the floor, almost like a dog on the shag carpet. Then someone would see her and she'd stop. Whey looked away she'd start again.</p>
<p>I kept hearing her mutter something every few minutes. It sounded like,</p>
<p>"Ssssoooooo clooose."</p>
<p>Sam passed the cards around and then leaned back, looking particularly pleased with what he held. Ashley took one look at her card, cursed, and threw it into the middle of the circle. She leaned back, crossed her arms over her breasts and stewed.</p>
<p>Now Kristen went and, being Kristen, she bet something she probably thought was extra super raunchy, but in light of everything else seemed pretty tame: she bet that she'd rub her boobs up and down someone's chest.</p>
<p>I guess maybe my little dry hump had given her some ideas. If she won, maybe her pussy would figure out some things, as well, and she'd really have a good time.</p>
<p>It hardly mattered. Krissy had nice boobs and it was a nice offer, but I could tell just by looking at Sam he was hoping for more. Kate seemed to have figured out she was in titty competition with Kristen (she knew better than to take on the big guns, aka Ashley). She called Kristen's bet. She made her breasts do a little hop as she said it, too.</p>
<p>How do ya like those melons?</p>
<p>I looked at my cards. A nine. A few rounds ago I'd be dancing around the room if I hit a nine. Now I was just gonna toss it away and wait for a better card. As I reached to fold, I took one last look at Sam. Y'know what? He was my friend. He would do me a solid. I'd do him a solid.</p>
<p>I raised.</p>
<p>"Hand job," I said. Sam's grin split his face. Without even missing a beat he re-raised.</p>
<p>"Oral," he said. Good man! Now things were getting interesting.</p>
<p>Ashley sank further back, positively boiling now. Girls don't have balls to get blue, but man, she really wasn't taking this well. Maybe her ovaries were aching.</p>
<p>Kristen, bless her heart, made a big show of considering. She had seemed a little sweet on Sam all night—maybe it was her need to fight for the underdog, maybe it was her way of staying in competition with Kate, I dunno. Maybe she just liked the guy.</p>
<p>Who knows? But she really seemed to think about giving him a solid shot if he won. I think it was the thought of what would happen if she lost that eventually scared her away.</p>
<p>It's one of those weird things I've noticed over the years. Girls have the world's most bestest thing ever—a vagina—and they are all instinctively terrified of the damn things. If guys were the same way about their cocks, filled with hatred instead of fully in love, the human species would have died out eons ago.</p>
<p>Kate, surprisingly, suddenly seemed game.</p>
<p>"Why not?" she smiled lovingly at Sam, "I call."</p>
<p>Sam looked a little disappointed at the result, but certainly not upset.</p>
<p>Look, say what you will, but I at least understood where Sam was coming from with all this. He was in a serious relationship with a beautiful girl who just didn't put out (or put out in such a disaffected a way that it made you wish she wouldn't). He wanted to see where the grass might be greener and, again, I got that. So he got to see a ton of boobs and Ashley touched his cock. Considering what else went on, he had been fairly well behaved.</p>
<p>And it's not like he was coming out of the bargain with nothing. He told me once that Kate wouldn't even kiss his cock, let alone give it a good suck. And based on what had already happened, I was pretty sure he would be able to talk her into doing it without a condom. Hell, I think the whole room might have had his back on that one.</p>
<p>So yeah. Not bad.</p>
<p>And if that was the last thing they ever did together as a couple, well, fuck it—there are worse ways to go out.</p>
<p>Sam smugly showed his king. Kate showed her ace.</p>
<p>Kate stood up and smiled, giving us a little show as she languidly made her way over to my hand job chair (The cold, wooden one. Perhaps, now, the sexiest Pier One purchase ever).</p>
<p>She lowered herself down, nice and slow, then grandly swept her legs open to reveal her neat, bald puss. I was so used to seeing horny, aching, dripping pussies, I was almost confused by her tidy little lips surrounding her clit. It's not like she wasn't aroused—of course she was aroused, she was sitting there, spread eagle, in front of five naked people, all of whom would be willing to fluff her up a little if she let them. Yeah, I'm pretty sure even Kristen would give a little stroke if she was asked.</p>
<p>Unlike the rest of us, however, Kate had cum. That moment of ultimate weakness had given her an incredible strength: the ability to be calm and patient and think things through. To not just need was a rare thing right now. It provided her with a unique perspective.</p>
<p>But, if Kate displayed less enthusiasm than you might expect, Sam showed none at all. He kind of grunted as he stood and shuffled over to his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Sam slowly knelt down and put his face right up against the target. He tentatively extended his tongue. Kate tilted her head back, ready to luxuriate in his ministrations.</p>
<p>When friends talk about their relationships, it's rare that you get more than one side. I'd known Kate (lusted after her, really) since high school, but we'd stopped talking once she started up with Sam.</p>
<p>It was awkward. She knew I wanted her. She chose my friend. It was kind of a bad scene, though neither of us performed it publicly. Not to each other anyway.</p>
<p>So all I ever got was Sam's perspective: Kate was frigid. Kate was prudish. Kate wouldn't spit on his schlong, let alone suck on it. Kate's hand jobs felt more like she was trying to rip his dick right off (ok, I knew from experience that was absolutely true).</p>
<p>Now, as my friend leaned in toward Kate's clean little cunnie, I could see all the things he didn't say. His own "do's and do nots." Apparently, a little tongue action fell into the 'do not' column.</p>
<p>To be fair, even if Sam was a fluent cunni-linguist, he probably would be out of practice. A girl unwilling to touch a penis with her bare hand is probably not gonna let you go down on her.</p>
<p>But man, Sam did not look like someone suddenly fulfilling his deepest desire. He was more like...a dude prodding a jellyfish with a stick. Verrrryyy tentative. Very nervous. Very much on guard. Kinda like Kristen would be when she touched her first penis.</p>
<p>Trust me. You'll see.</p>
<p>It was bad. I mean really really bad bad. You might think a dude going to town on a beautiful girl could not be ruined, but this was maybe one of the least sexy things I'd ever seen.</p>
<p>My cock, so hard and desperate for anything—a pussy, a mouth, a hand, a half-carved pumpkin—was almost limp by the end of it. At one point, Ashley actually covered her eyes, like she was watching a car accident or a surgery.</p>
<p>In that moment—Sam going after it with all the enthusiasm of a lactose intolerant on an ice cream cone—it all became clear. Kate, that magnificent bitch, had taken the best, most complete, most brutal revenge possible. Calling Sam's penis her little friend. Stroking his best bud off with her bare hands. Shouting out her carnal pleasures while Ashley sat supplicant at her feet. That was all playing around. This shit was serious.</p>
<p>You think you're such a passionate lover? She seemed to ask. You think I'm the only thing keeping you from all your fantasies? You want to show all the girls what a big bad man you are? Here you go, baby. Show em what you got.</p>
<p>She knew what would happen. She set him up for a fall and he dove right in.</p>
<p>We didn't even set the timer. We didn't need to. At a certain point, Kate simply declared herself done, pushed Sam away from her platter and walked away. Sam got up, little specks of pussy juice on his face, and tried to make a show of it.</p>
<p>At that point no one cared.</p>
<p>It was such a complete and utter evisceration; I was actually surprised when Sam sat himself down for the next hand. When Kristen is giving you the big, wet, pity eyes, that's the end of it: you're not getting laid. With three more hands to go, why even bother.</p>
<p>Kate had her revenge. At this point, she was probably planning to make Sam sleep on the floor. Then she'd catch a ride back to the shore in the morning.</p>
<p>Kate had beaten him beyond return. She knew there was no coming back.</p>
<p>She was so so so wrong.</p>
<p>Kate settled back down as best she could. Bad oral sex is maybe the worst thing ever? You're all riled up. Your body starts working towards the big moment. Then suddenly you're sitting there cold, wet, and frustrated. I've actually felt angry after a bad blow job. Not unsatisfied. Legitimately fully, truly pissed off.</p>
<p>Ashley had the deal. It was clear she wanted to make the most of it. When she looked at her card, she practically jumped out of her long-ago-discarded shoes.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah," she exclaimed, "I am so done with this shit."</p>
<p>We all laughed at her enthusiasm. I knew it right off: this was gonna be fuuuuun.</p>
<p>Kristen, first to act, took Ashley's excitement the other way and folded. She didn't even bother to look at her card.</p>
<p>Kate gave Ash a long, meaningful look. Then she bet a hand job.</p>
<p>Oh wow. That was the whole megillah right there.</p>
<p>Kate had put Sam in his place. Now she was getting hers. Ashley needed to get off. Kate did too. Ashley would raise to oral, everyone would fold, and then Kate would get her pussy good and going.</p>
<p>And if Ashley maybe swung around to get some for herself? It's not like anyone was going to complain about watching those two take a roll around the living room.</p>
<p>Kate. Beautiful, fucking perfect Kate.</p>
<p>I didn't have shit. At that point, I was resigned to Kate getting what she wanted (again). Why stick my big, stupid 'nose' into it? I folded.</p>
<p>Ashley's face split a mile wide. They were home free. Sam wasn't calling shit. They were home free.</p>
<p>Then Emma, blessed beautiful little Emma, my pretty, perfect little sis looked over her pert little peaches at her card and said.</p>
<p>"Raise."</p>
<p>Well no one saw that coming.</p>
<p>"Oral."</p>
<p>And just like that, wow, Emma made her move. She had been so quiet, really for the whole game. She had some control early on, back around when she still had a bra and some shorts. But then I played the older brother card and kept her out of it. Then Sam got uppity and Kate grabbed his reins. So, Emma just sat on the sidelines, playing the good little cheerleader. Watching the game go on.</p>
<p>I hadn't exactly forgotten about her, I mean, how could I? But she had sat back for so long, I guess I kinda figured she was done.</p>
<p>Kate glared at Emma. It was obvious Kate was not going to call now. She couldn't, wouldn't, give Emma the (literal) satisfaction. The cards would fold around. Kate would have to find satisfaction from her fingers like everyone else.</p>
<p>Sam did his due diligence and folded.</p>
<p>Ashley looked down at her hand again.</p>
<p>"Shit," she said.</p>
<p>She looked up at Kate, looking strangely apologetic. How deep were those two in?</p>
<p>"Shit shit shit. I call," Ashley said, "I have to have to call."</p>
<p>She kinda squeezed her legs in and out as she said it, as if punctuating her point. Kate just sighed in disgust and tossed her card on the ground.</p>
<p>Ashley was clearly conflicted. She flipped over her card. Queen. How appropriate.</p>
<p>Emma just closed her eyes and sighed. Kate let out a little giggle.</p>
<p>Then Emma showed her ace.</p>
<p>"Fuck!" Ashley shouted, "Fuck fuck fuck!"</p>
<p>Kristen clapped her hands in delight.</p>
<p>"Nice hand, Em!" she cheered. I didn't know whether to be happy for my sister or horrified.</p>
<p>"I just want to get llllaaaid," Ashley whined, "I don't want to lick girl pussy. I want someone to lick my girl pussy."</p>
<p>She stomped back and forth through the living room.</p>
<p>"You two," she pointed at my sister and I, "you little fuckers are fucking kiiiillling me."</p>
<p>I smiled and chuckled.</p>
<p>"It's not funny," Ashley pouted. Then she looked at Emma, as if appraising her for the first time.</p>
<p>She smiled, wickedly.</p>
<p>"Fucking killing me," Ashley said again, this time smiling broadly.</p>
<p>"You want me to rub you off first before you have your little lesbo adventure?" Kate asked.</p>
<p>Emma just dismissed her and stood up. Once again, there was a deep dark stain where Emma had been sitting. Holy fuck was that girl worked up.</p>
<p>We laid down Kate's cum blanket (See. That name's not going away) and Emma immediately assumed the position. Head and back down, arms up in a "T," legs open. Her pretty little pussy was already drooling all over the blanket. Her inner thighs practically glowed with girly goodness. The boat probably already smelled like a whorehouse. Now it was bathed in the odor of sweet, pungent puss.</p>
<p>Emma was on her back, arms splayed. It made her little peaches recede back to plums. Her pretty puss was just gushing. Her pubes looked tangled and sticky.</p>
<p>My cock had deflated a bit after Sam's cunnilingal catastrophe, but little Jason was back at full strength now. Emma was absolutely flat fucking gorgeous lying there, prone, waiting to be taken. I was gonna have to go into the kitchen and stab myself right now. It was they only way I could keep from doing something we'd both regret for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>My eyes tracked up her body, from her cute little "best" feet past her amazingly gorgeous "best" pussy up to her incredible, deep green "best" eyes. They were flitting about the room, looking at everything and nothing at once. For all her outward confidence, Emma was scared. I felt for her in that moment. She was just lying there, exposed. Vulnerable. Naked in the fullest sense of the word.</p>
<p>Ashley, about to complete her tour du familia, laid down next to Em. Then she sort of climbed up my sister's side and whispered something in Emma's ear. Em locked her eyes on the ceiling. Then she nodded, once. Yes. Ashley paused, thinking for a moment. She looked at Em. Looked at the room. Then she whispered something else in Emma's ear. Emma nodded yes, emphatically.</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>"OK, baby," Ashley said. She smiled warmly at my sister and gave her a little kiss, right on the lips. Then she slowly drifted back down to Emma's amazing, shining thighs.</p>
<p>"Hey big bro," Ashley called from between my sister's legs.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>She gestured for me to come over. It was like being invited up to the dais before the big ceremony. I was a VIP. Very Immature Puck-head.</p>
<p>I knelt over by where Ashley was waiting. I did my best to ignore the fact that we were sharing our little sidebar with a very wet, very welcoming vagina. A vagina that also happened to be my sister's.</p>
<p>"Look," Ashley whispered, "your sister is really really nervous. She's never done...stuff like this and doing it in front of everybody—her friends, her brother's friends..."</p>
<p>"Her brother," I added.</p>
<p>"Sure. Well, anyway, look. I need you to do me, well her, a really big favor."</p>
<p>"Ash, shit, I'm really not comfortable..."</p>
<p>"Fuck off. I don't care about how comfortable you are, OK? Your baby sister needs you and you're gonna be there to support her. You don't want to be sexy with your sis? Fine. Then don't invite her to big naked sexy orgy parties."</p>
<p>"This isn't a..."</p>
<p>Ashley just glared at me.</p>
<p>"OK. It's a big naked sexy orgy party," I said.</p>
<p>Ashley took both my hands in hers.</p>
<p>"Look. I understand. There's so much...guilt and pressure and bullshit built into this stuff. People have a hard time with it. I get that. But I'm not asking you to rub your sister off or play with her tits while I work her clit..."</p>
<p>We both watched my cock leap when she said that.</p>
<p>"...Just sit with her. Hold her hand. Help her through it. At least to start. She's gonna have an awesome time and nothing should get in the way of that, OK?"</p>
<p>"Awesome time, huh?" I teased.</p>
<p>Ashley just looked at me and smiled, knowingly. Holy holy holy holy holy shit.</p>
<p>"So you're actually telling me that in order for Emma to really enjoy this, she needs to have her naked brother by her side, holding her and comforting her?"</p>
<p>"Pretty much," Ashley said. She had already turned her attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>"Isn't that a little...wrong?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I dunno. Always worked for me."</p>
<p>I was halfway up Emma's body before what Ashley said sank in.</p>
<p>I sat down cross legged. My knees were next to Emma's head. I was an arm's length from reaching down and cupping her perfect peachy boob. I tried to remind myself not to think like that.</p>
<p>"Hey," I said.</p>
<p>"Hey," she smiled. Ashley looked up from between Emma's legs and gave me the thumbs up. I gave it back to her. Were we getting a little oral here or starting up a 1920s-era airplane?</p>
<p>"If it's ok, I'm just gonna sit up here with you while Ashley...well, y'know...does this."</p>
<p>"It's ok," Emma said. I was waiting for her to tell me I was being weird but she said nothing.</p>
<p>Kristen turned down the light. Everyone crowded around.</p>
<p>I reached down and touched Emma's hand, she put her palm in mine and squeezed.</p>
<p>Then, like someone had suddenly plugged her in, Em's whole body just stiffened.</p>
<p>"Oh my," she breathed.</p>
<p>I tried to look down to see what was happening, but it was dark and Em's body had plenty of distractions. All I saw was a little curly head bobbing up and down in the distance. A blonde, steel wool sponge was going down on my sister.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Emma exclaimed, shuddering.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she said again. Her hand dug into mine.</p>
<p>"Too much?" Ashley asked. She peeked her head up from Emma's pubes.</p>
<p>"Just a little...ticklish..." Emma said.</p>
<p>"Oh," Ashley said, "no worries then. That's half the fun."</p>
<p>She ducked her head back down. This was all very weird.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Emma said almost immediately, her grip grew even tighter.</p>
<p>I looked down and saw her arm was drifting dangerously close to my throbbing dick. I shifted slightly so we could get a better grip on each other without the risk of embarrassing...contact.</p>
<p>"Holy fuck are you juicy," Ashley called up.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Emma said, wincing.</p>
<p>"Oh baby, don't be sorry," Ashley said, "It's fucking awesome."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Emma said. Then right after, right out of her chest, she made a long, low, "oooooohhhhhhh."</p>
<p>Like a purring cat, then, she let out a deep growl, and stretched herself out far and flat, taking my hand with her. Her legs dropped straight down to the floor, then popped right back up again and spread out farther than I ever thought they could go.</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, oh," she sobbed, head tossing back and forth.</p>
<p>"You OK, baby?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oh God...so good."</p>
<p>"It's ok, sis. I got you."</p>
<p>"So good, Jason...So so good."</p>
<p>I looked down at her and smiled.</p>
<p>"Oh Jason...oh that's so good."</p>
<p>"Well, it's Ashley doing most of the work," I joked, immediately regretting it. I was here for my support, not my comedy stylings.</p>
<p>"It's ok it's it's ok it's ok," she rambled. Her legs shot straight out again, then popped back up.</p>
<p>"Sorry, that one was on me," Ashley called up, "Slipped for a sec there."</p>
<p>"It's ok it's ok it's ok," Emma continued on.</p>
<p>"Guess it's ok," Sam said. Kristen punched him on the shoulder. Hard.</p>
<p>I looked down at my little sis, her bright green eyes were practically shining in the darkness. She started shaking. Her perfect peaches shook in time with her tremors. My cock was positively pounding.</p>
<p>"Ooooooohhhhh...Jason. Jason Jason Jason."</p>
<p>"It's ok, Em," I said, "I gotcha."</p>
<p>"It's so...good. Why didn't anyone tell me it was so good?"</p>
<p>I smiled wryly at her. She was about to say something when her mouth snapped shut and she went stiff again.</p>
<p>"Aaaaaooowww," she howled, head thrown back. Her legs popped up again. I saw she was jamming her cunt downward, into Ashley's face.</p>
<p>"Come on, baby. Come on," I said, "You can get there. Come on."</p>
<p>"Ooooh Gaahhhhd," Emma was just absolutely pistoning down on poor Ashley, like she was trying to stick her non-existent dick down Ash's throat.</p>
<p>Her tits pinwheeled around on her chest. Her hair, damp and discordant. Anytime Emma got a break between gasps, she blew her bangs out of her eyes. I don't know why I didn't notice it before. Emma still had her hair up. That was so very very Emma. Completely naked, hair still in a pony tail. I had to laugh a little.</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh! Oooowhoooooa! ohhhhhh! ohhhhhh! ohhhhhh! Fuck I'm close. Fuck that's close. Fuck I'm fucking close!" She cried.</p>
<p>"It's ok, baby. You can get there," I said, "I know you can. You want to cum, right? You need to cum. Come on baby. You can get there, baby."</p>
<p>"Don't...don't call me that," Emma panted.</p>
<p>"What?" I was surprised.</p>
<p>"Don't call me baby," Emma said, "I'm not your baby. I'm your sis. I'm your little baby sis. I'm your little baby sister and I need my...I need my big brother, OK? I need my big bwuther to come and help me. OK? Come on big bwuvver. Be there for your baby sis."</p>
<p>When she said it, my cock almost jumped right off my crotch. I was hard enough for hanging laundry and absolutely leaking clear juice, like a faulty faucet. Hah. So much like my sister.</p>
<p>Emma stared right through me then, her need so full. So raw. She was dripping sweat—running in rivulets down her forehead, her neck, her chest. Dribbling down to the blanket like oh so much of her girl cum had already done. Oh to press my mouth to her and lick up her sweet sweaty chest.</p>
<p>"Ok, sissy..." I started. But I never called her sissy. Sissy was Kate's mean pet name for Emma. It was what Ashley had called Emma when she was trying to mock me about my little sister's panties.</p>
<p>"OK, sis," I started again, "OK little sis. I'm here for you. Big brother's here."</p>
<p>I squeezed her hand.</p>
<p>"I...I'm so close. I want... I want..."</p>
<p>"I know baby sis. I know it's so hard but it's so good. Ash's doing such a good job on your little clitty. You're gonna cum so hard. But you gotta hang on, ok little sis? Big brother is here for you, but you gotta hang on OK?"</p>
<p>Emma was gasping for air. I'd seen her run miles and not gasp for breath like this. I was gasping, too. I think everyone was.</p>
<p>"Oh...oh...ohhhhhhhh," her body suddenly shook, then twisted, then stopped. I thought she'd had it then. Such a big build up for a little peak. But wow, still pretty awesome, though.</p>
<p>Then I saw that wasn't what was happening at all. Emma was groaning it frustration, not pleasure. She slid down aggressively, pulling my arm with her. In the confusion, Ashley's head had popped up so she could take a breath. She looked like she'd been bobbing for apples—her face and her nose and her chin were just dripping with thick, girly goo.</p>
<p>Then Emma kicked out her legs, slid a bit further, and wrapped her thighs right around Ashley's bouncy little blonde curls.</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>Emma absolutely locked her legs in place, burying Ashley in Emma's juicy juicy quim. Ashley kind of struggled for a second, more from the surprise than anything, but she wasn't going anywhere. Legs of steel. I couldn't believe it. I would have to rethink my leg rankings after all.</p>
<p>Emma was almost bent over backward now. Her legs were on an angle, coiled around Ashley's neck. That left Emma's beautiful little bottom just hanging above the floor and put most of her weight back on her chest and neck. If the position bothered her, she didn't mention anything about it.</p>
<p>But in repositioning herself, purely by accident, Emma had also slid her face right under my throbbing, dripping cock.</p>
<p>"Oh," she said, looking up at it.</p>
<p>"Sorry," I said and tried to shift.</p>
<p>Emma gasped mid-sentence, arched her back and howled.</p>
<p>"Oh GOD!" she cried.</p>
<p>"I gotcha, Em, I gotcha," I said.</p>
<p>She just lay there, writhing, hopefully not suffocating Ashley too badly.</p>
<p>"Oh, Jason," she moaned, "Oh Jason. Oh Jay-Jay. Oh my big strong Jay bird. It's so good. It's so good. It's so good."</p>
<p>"I know, Em. I know. I gotcha."</p>
<p>"I...I don't think...Oh god it's so good. I've gotta get there. Help me get there, big bruvver. Help your baby sis."</p>
<p>She was so driven, so hysterical. I couldn't ask her what she meant. How could I help her get there?</p>
<p>"OK, baby sis. OK Em. It's ok. You can do it. I know you can."</p>
<p>She groaned again. The long, loud frustrated one.</p>
<p>"Come on Em. Don't you want to show off for big bruvver? Don't you want to show your big bro you can do it? Show me. Show me Em. Show me little, Emmy. Show big bruvver what a good girl you are. Don't you want me to see?"</p>
<p>"Uh...uh huh...uh huh..." she sobbed.</p>
<p>"That's it. That's a good little sister. Show big bruvver. Show me you can get there. Come on Em. Make me proud. Show big bruvver how good his little sis' big beautiful cum is. Don't you want to? Don't you want to show me?"</p>
<p>"Ohhhhhohohoh yes. Oh god yes. Please..."</p>
<p>"There you go, little sis. There you go baby sis. I know you want to come so bad. You want to show your big bruvver. You want big bruvver to see. Show me, Em. Show me. I want to see it so bad. I do. I do. I want to see you cum, Emmy. I want to see my baby Emmy cum so bad..."</p>
<p>Emma shuddered then collapsed. She dropped my hand as she dropped to the floor. Oh no. Did I saw something wrong? She folded in half, her beautiful tits crushed into her shiny, strong thighs. I reached for her.</p>
<p>Emma fell back, howled in frustration. Great big, angry sobs.</p>
<p>"Aaaaawhoah whoa whoa whoa...."</p>
<p>I reached for her again but she wasn't looking. She reached back. I grabbed at her hand. She quickly swatted me away.</p>
<p>I tried to reach over to grab hold. She was shaking. Sweating. Slapping at my hands.</p>
<p>Then, in the split second between our back and forth fumbling, Emma's hands shot past me. She grabbed my big, hard cock.</p>
<p>Then she froze. She squeezed me as hard me as she could. Emma arched her back. Her body gave in to all her effort. I nearly fell over as she clenched, my cock just moments from bursting in relief.</p>
<p>My sister clutched my cock in her hand—all warm and wet with sweat and wonderful—and let out a scream of absolute primal pleasure.</p>
<p>"There it is," she breathed.</p>
<p>"OH!" she squeaked. She shuddered. Her grip on my cock stayed tight.</p>
<p>"There it is, there it is, there it is," she chanted, "there it...IIIIIIISSSSSSS!"</p>
<p>She howled. Her eyes rolled back into her head. Her legs dropped off Ashley, who almost immediately fell over in relief. Emma's whole chest and neck and cheeks flushed hot pink.</p>
<p>She stiffened, then collapsed like an accordion.</p>
<p>"There it is!" she cried, "There it is big bruvver. There it is."</p>
<p>She was still shaking. Aftershocks.</p>
<p>"There it is big bruvver there it is. Did I do ok for you? Did I come good for my big bruvver? Ohhhh I hope I came ok for you."</p>
<p>She looked up at me, her eyes shining like emerald flashlights in the darkness. Her chest and cheeks slowly faded back to pale.</p>
<p>"Yeah, baby sis," I told, her lightly stroking her hair, "You did great. You always do so great baby sister."</p>
<p>Emma was still gripping my cock like it was her security blanket. Her hand felt warm and soft—worshipful and devoted. I hoped that she would give it back to me soon. I hoped that she would never ever ever give it back to me.</p>
<p>Then she sat up, cock still in hand, and pressed her lips to mine. She tasted like strawberries and alcohol. Pot and sweat.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I heard people cheering in the background.</p>
<p>Emma eventually let go of my cock.</p>
<p>With two hands left, per Kate's pronouncement, the game was basically over. After my sister's little performance, we were all feeling good. Everyone was ready to end on a high-pitched scream.</p>
<p>Almost everyone.</p>
<p>While Emma cleaned up, I talked to Kristen and Kate. Maybe we should just let the last two hands go. After all, what was left to play for?</p>
<p>Then Ashley started pacing back and forth across the room. Her springy hair bounced in time with her incredible boobs.</p>
<p>"I'm so fucking horny. I don't fucking care what anyone calls. I'm fucking doing it."</p>
<p>Very well then.</p>
<p>I understood what Ashley was asking for. After all the hand jobs and the booby feels and the dry hump and the tongue bath, Ashley had to be pretty damn worked up. Also, if Emma and I had earned a round of applause for our little performance, then Ashley deserved a fucking standing ovation. So she had that going for her.</p>
<p>But it's not like she was the only one. By this point my cock looked and felt like a steel crane. My balls were practically glowing bright red and were probably heavy enough to smash through concrete. I was a walking demolition crew. But I wasn't walking around demanding my due attention. I was thinking about grabbing an ice pack for the overnight, sure, but I wasn't shouting about how I had to get my rocks off.</p>
<p>Hell, Ashley had actually fired one off the night before. I don't think I'm insulting her in assuming she had at least a couple of lovers waiting for her back at college. I hadn't gotten laid in 6 months and hadn't been able to get myself off for almost a week (traveling back from college with Sam had...limited my opportunities for a quick scrub and go). If I could hold off then certainly Little Miss Curly-Lamp could call it a night.</p>
<p>But, whatever—Ashley had to get off, so Ashley was gonna get off.</p>
<p>We had the system pretty much down by now. Kristen dealt the hand. Kate folded. For old time's sake, I throw up a hand job. Maybe Ashley and me—the two hard-up heroes—could get each other off.</p>
<p>Emma, still glowing, folded. Sam looked up from behind his card. When Sam is plotting, he kinda makes the same mischievous face his certainly-soon-to-be ex-girlfriend does.</p>
<p>Ashley didn't even bother to sit. She just paced back forth by the kitchen. Sam watched her go for a moment.</p>
<p>"Are you done yet?" Ashley called over, "who won?"</p>
<p>"Right now it's me with a hand job," I called back.</p>
<p>"Fine. Great. Whatever it is, I call," Ashley said.</p>
<p>Sam looked back at his card. He was squeezing his knuckles white. What's there to think about, Sam?</p>
<p>"Fucking shit, guys, it's not that fucking hard!" Ashley yelled, "Jesus!"</p>
<p>Sam lowered his card slowly. He smiled, suddenly relaxed. Decision made.</p>
<p>"Anal," he said. He was so quiet I swore I misheard him.</p>
<p>"Wait, what?" I asked.</p>
<p>Ashley stopped pacing.</p>
<p>"What did he say?" she asked, "What was the bet?"</p>
<p>"Anal," Sam said, now grinning like a fool, "Anal, anal anal. You'll call any bet? That's my bet. Anal."</p>
<p>Holy fuck.</p>
<p>Kristen's jaw hit the floor. For a moment I was sure she'd had a stroke. Emma grabbed for my hand and squeezed it hard, I thought about moving it over to my cock, but then she dug her nails into me.</p>
<p>"Sam..." Kate started.</p>
<p>"Bet's a bet," Sam said.</p>
<p>"So what, she beats your hand, she can shove something up your ass?" Emma asked angrily.</p>
<p>"Not likely," Sam snickered.</p>
<p>"She hasn't even called yet," I said.</p>
<p>"No, I did," Ashley said, "I called."</p>
<p>"It's not even your turn yet," I said.</p>
<p>She came back to where we were sitting and flopped down. She looked at her card, made a raspberry, then dropped it.</p>
<p>"I don't understand," Kristen said.</p>
<p>Ashley leaned over to her</p>
<p>"Anal is when a boy puts his..."</p>
<p>"I know what anal sex is goddammit!" Kristen shouted.</p>
<p>We looked at each other, full of nervous laughter.</p>
<p>"Ok, then," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"Ash, you don't have to..." Kate started.</p>
<p>She looked ghostwhite. She didn't think it could happen. She had him buried. Done. And now he was back from the dead, haunting her.</p>
<p>Sam was gonna get one last screw, and he was gonna do it into Kate's best bud and probable slice on the side.</p>
<p>Holy fucking fuck.</p>
<p>Then I realized. Kate wasn't scared. Not at all. She was angry. That was so much much much worse.</p>
<p>"It's your move, Ashley," I said.</p>
<p>"Here," Sam said, "let me help you out."</p>
<p>He showed her the ace. He had her beat not matter what.</p>
<p>Ashley just sat there and shrugged. She had seemed so bright and buoyant all night. Now the girl who stood quietly in my living room all day yesterday was back. My little lamp was unplugged and packed away.</p>
<p>"If we were playing poker for real," Ashley said, "I made my call before he bet, but that's still binding. That's how it works, right Jason? I called and I can't un-call just because I don't like the raise."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but Ash, this isn't real poker. It's just not."</p>
<p>"It was real poker when I made Emma kiss Kristen. It was real poker when I dragged myself all over you. When I played with Kate's boyfriend's cock. When I made you help your baby sister cum. That was poker, then right?"</p>
<p>"You make yourself sound like some...bully," I said, "It wasn't like that, Ashley. Everybody here made their own decisions."</p>
<p>"Did they?" Ashley asked, looking over at Kristen. Kristen said nothing, just slightly, almost imperceptibly, shook her head.</p>
<p>I rubbed my face—squeezed my temples with my thumb and fingers.</p>
<p>Sam stood up, cock standing proud, and grabbed the Kate cum blanket off the couch. As he laid it out, it covered Kate's head for a moment. There was no doubt in my mind it was intentional.</p>
<p>Ashley stood up as well. Her perfect titties jiggled so perfectly as she moved.</p>
<p>"Ash. Don't," Kate said.</p>
<p>Ashley walked past.</p>
<p>"No," Ashley said, "I wanted to get off. I'm getting off. What kind of lube do we got in this place?</p>
<p>As it turned out, not much lube. We had enough condoms and granola bars for a full on Woodstock revival show, but not even one little tube of anything that would work as lubricant. It was another feature for them to add to Colgate Total, eventually, I'd imagine. So for now, the girls made the sacrifice and agreed to chip in.</p>
<p>Ashley got down on all fours. She leaned forward and put her little brown button up for display. Sam stood behind her, legs apart, cock at the ready. Before he could begin, Sam had to endure one final indignity—Ashley insisted he wear a condom. I went and grabbed one from his suitcase in the master bedroom. There was whole roll of them just hanging out the front of his Samsonite, like a long, thin tongue.</p>

<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>For a moment, I thought I should grab a couple more. Just in case. But then I thought, just in case of what? They weren't going multiple rounds on this one. We weren't gonna start yelling anal at each other the last hand of the night (though it made for a funny mental image, I grant). So I took just the one—labeled extra-lubricated, thankfully—and gave it to Sam. He didn't even bother to thank me before perfunctorily rolling it on.</p>
<p>Then each of the girls stood on either side of him, spit on their hand, and rubbed their saliva on to his covered cock. It should have been hot, but instead it just felt so clinical. Removed. Even Sam seemed only a little distracted by his anointing.</p>
<p>Then the girls went over to Ashley and did the same thing for her tight, wrinkled asterisk. I noticed Kate even reached down and collected a little of her personal lubricant to spread on Ashley's hole. It was kind of a sweet gesture, strangely, and I knew it wasn't for Sam's sake.</p>
<p>Then we all stood back, looking more like pall bearers than excited onlookers. At the last second, right as Sam looked ready to take the plunge, I went over to Ashley and knelt by her head. She turned her head and smiled at me.</p>
<p>"One last squeeze before we go?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Sure," she laughed, "why not."</p>
<p>I reached under her arm and cupped her boob in my hand. The hard nipple seemed almost to suckle at my skin as I grasped what had to be the world's most amazing tit-flesh. Warm and cool and soft and hard all over, they fit in my palms like they were made for it.</p>
<p>I look a long deep sigh, squeezed nice and tight, and then let go.</p>
<p>"God, those are perfect," I said as I pulled my hand back.</p>
<p>"There's plenty that come plenty close," Ashley told me.</p>
<p>"True dat," I said.</p>
<p>She laughed at that. A low, deep chuckle punctuated with a cute little snort. I realized that this was the first time I'd heard her laugh. Her real laugh. She'd made little giggles and guffaws before—acknowledgements of the humor of something. But nothing like that. It felt true and warm and it almost made me fall in love with her a little.</p>
<p>We shared a smile.</p>
<p>"You ever...?" I gestured back at her bottom.</p>
<p>"Nah," she said.</p>
<p>"You wanna hold my hand?"</p>
<p>She smiled again.</p>
<p>"Nah. It's ok. I got it."</p>
<p>I kissed Ashley's cheek, then stood up and stepped away.</p>
<p>To be honest, I didn't really watch the big backside event. Even the people standing right there seemed a little checked out. It was too late. Too many feelings were raw. Maybe I was naïve. Maybe if we had stopped before this last hand, everything still would have fallen apart. But at the time I felt like I'd really blown it, and I think everybody kinda felt the same.</p>
<p>I busied myself in the kitchen—quietly put away dishes. I found my sleeping bag and unrolled it on the far side of the living room. I left a clean pair of pjs on the sleeping bag. Lord knows why I thought I'd use them. I tossed away as many empty bottles as I could reach and tried to save as many full ones as I could find.</p>
<p>The whole time, I heard little snippets of Sam and Ashley working each other over.</p>
<p>"Oooo. Ow. OK. No, no. Ok, you got it,. Ooops, Wait. Hang on." Ashley said.</p>
<p>"There baby I'm almost there...," Sam moaned.</p>
<p>"No, I know baby...just hang you're at a bad...OK, there it goes."</p>
<p>"Oh that's so good baby, you're butt is so fucking tiiiight."</p>
<p>"Yeah, oh yeah, baby. That's it. Give it to me. Give it to me good. Oh. Hang on baby, I'm just reaching back...Oh there it is baby. There's my little clitty. Oh...oh there it is. Come on now."</p>
<p>There were little squishing sounds and the slap of flesh upon flesh. By the end, Ashley was asking Sam to pull out, but he finished in her ass anyway. Then he pulled out, whipped off the condom and tossed it across the room, splattering his sperm against the wall.</p>
<p>Ash came too, barely slowing for Sam's big finish. Ashley strummed herself to completion only a few seconds after the condom took flight,</p>
<p>I missed that part. I was brushing my teeth.</p>
<p>Getting everyone back to the circle wasn't exactly easy. I guess we thought it was important, though, because we all waited till everyone was sitting again. Everyone had stayed naked. All of us were looking a little bit worse for the wear. Sober was still a good ways off and the sun had yet to appear on the horizon. So I guess it was workable.</p>
<p>Now that Sam parked in Ashley's cul-de-sac, I was pretty positive we weren't going for another ride the next day. Everyone looked so...out there... It was like we had all gone too far. Had seen and experienced things no human should. We were stranded beyond the realm of sanity and shock in a place where only ugly, stark truth remained.</p>
<p>My cock ached, my balls ached and I just wanted to get to bed. Really and truly. Fuck cumming. Tomorrow would be my first day as a monk.</p>
<p>"Let's just get this over with," Kate said.</p>
<p>She dealt me a jack. Not bad, really. I was first to act—a lousy spot—and I was ready to be done. I bet kiss. Either someone would call and we'd have a quick finish, or they would raise and I could drop out, knowing I had given it at least one last go.</p>
<p>Emma raised my kiss to a hand. She looked me right in the eye.</p>
<p>We were going to have to have a talk before bed. We'd already blown past the safety barrier. If I didn't slam the breaks as soon as possible we'd go right over the cliff.</p>
<p>Sam insta-folded. I don't think he even looked at his card. He'd made his point. He wanted to move on from all this misery. I could tell. As soon as someone sobered up enough to give him a ride back to shore, he'd be gone.</p>
<p>Ashley, too, looked more worn out than satisfied. She just threw her card in, like tossing a losing lottery ticket. I was hoping she'd stay, but I wasn't surprised when she didn't.</p>
<p>Kristen, feeling brave I guess, raised to oral. I knew she wasn't going for Kate or Emma. Did young, innocent Kristen actually want to suck me off? Or was she fantasizing about where Emma had gone—betting I'd know how to get her there?</p>
<p>Well that was a good turn of events, now wasn't it? Oh, the thought of rolling Kristen's nipples in my fingers while her tongue and hair were wrapped around my cock...</p>
<p>Hell yeah, then. Go Kristen! Kate looked at everyone and just rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Ugh," she said, "I don't have the energy for this fuck fest anymore."</p>
<p>"Fuck," she said.</p>
<p>"That's a fold?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, it's a fuck, fuckhead. I'm done with this shit. Now just everybody fold so we can go to bed."</p>
<p>I was super confused for a minute. If Kate was tired of this, why was she upping the stakes? But then I got it. She wasn't really upping anything.</p>
<p>Emma and Kristen and I were all still in the hand. Even if I just said 'call' and Em folded, Kate would have to watch Kristen polish my knob while my baby sister worked my balls.</p>
<p>Holy fuck. How the hell did I let Kate cheat me out of getting that?</p>
<p>Anyway, she wasn't interested in watching that, or seeing Kristen get her first real cum or viewing the premier episode of Emma and Kristen's girl-on-girl super show or whatever was about to happen. She was done. She had lost.</p>
<p>She had made her big play, embarrassed her boyfriend and yet he had still somehow had the last laugh. Fine. But she wasn't gonna sit around and let everyone else enjoy themselves while she packed her bags to go back to college in the morning.</p>
<p>So she declared an end to it.</p>
<p>I know what you're thinking. All right Jason! Just call the bet and plough the bitch! But that was the problem. That was the best part of her bet. Remember, it was winner's choice. That's how she had ended up giving herself a handjob. We had never adjusted the rules from that. If we had thought about it, we would have.</p>
<p>But we didn't. It probably had something to do with consuming mass amounts of alcohol. And pot.</p>
<p>If I called and she won, well, winner's choice. She could tell me to go hump a tree and I'd have to find a trunk that hopefully didn't have too much heavy bark.</p>
<p>That's why that play had worked so well before. Unless you were 100% sure you had her beat, you just couldn't call. Even Kristen knew she didn't want to lose her virginity to Treebeard.</p>
<p>It wasn't their turn yet, but I could already tell that Emma and Kristen were going to fold. They weren't even trying to hide it. I looked back at my Jack.</p>
<p>There went my last chance.</p>
<p>Then, curiously, I felt something kind of poke at the back of my mind—that kind of 'did I leave the oven on?' moment of mental clarity. I looked back at my card. Back at Kristen and Emma and Kate.</p>
<p>Kate.</p>
<p>Kate's card.</p>
<p>You could barely see it but right at the tip of Kate's fingers, the top left-hand corner was bent. Slightly. Like it had been thrown into the ground at some point.</p>
<p>Because of course it had been thrown into the ground. All the way back back back in the beginning, when Sam had his hand job tantrum, he showed us his winning hand before throwing it into the carpet in disgust.</p>
<p>And the corner had bent.</p>
<p>And he had marked the card.</p>
<p>And I had thought, I'd better take this card out of the deck or get out some clean cards because now everyone knew that the card with the bent corner was Sam's old jack.</p>
<p>But I never did. In all the excitement I just left the card in there and it shuffled around and around and around until it sat in Kate's hand at that very moment.</p>
<p>So now I could look at Kate—Kate who had just put her pussy on the table—and know for an absolute certainty that she was holding the jack of diamonds.</p>
<p>And I had the jack of clubs.</p>
<p>And that meant I knew, KNEW, I'd be clubbing Kate's beautiful little diamond that night.</p>
<p>Kate raised her eyebrow at me.</p>
<p>"I call," I said, smiling. She smiled back. Licked her lips.</p>
<p>"Jason, I swear to God. You're gonna fucking regret that fucking call," Kate said. Weak when strong. Strong when weak. I had figured that one out way back when Sam was doing it. Kate knew I had her beat.</p>
<p>Emma and Kristen, though, didn't, so they quickly folded.</p>
<p>"Show me yours, I'll show you mine," I said.</p>
<p>"Little late for that," she said, eyeing me from toes to head. She couldn't hide her little look of appreciation at my pendulous penis.</p>
<p>"Fine," I shrugged. I showed her my jack. Suddenly she perked up. She showed her jack to the group.</p>
<p>"Tie!" she exclaimed, "we have the same card!"</p>
<p>"That you do," Ashley said, "so what?"</p>
<p>"So it means no one wins, right? Because we have the same card?"</p>
<p>"Technically in poker it means we both win," I said, "we split the pot."</p>
<p>"How do you split the pot in...dirty naked poker or whatever the hell this is?"</p>
<p>Dirty naked poker. That was the name! I'd spent all game trying to figure it out and had Kate solved it in seconds.</p>
<p>"I think it means you both have to fuck," Kristen said.</p>
<p>Kate just glared at her.</p>
<p>"Actually, I think it means you both have to fuck each other," Emma said.</p>
<p>"No, it does not," Kate said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I think it does," I said.</p>
<p>I looked over to Sam. Crazily, I thought he would be happy. He was getting one last good one over Kate. But he didn't look happy. Not at all.</p>
<p>"You just couldn't wait to make me miserable," Kate told Emma.</p>
<p>"Actually, hon," Ashley said, "I think... I think you might really enjoy this."</p>
<p>Kate looked at her friend. She shook her head.</p>
<p>"Fine. Whatever."</p>
<p>Kate got up and walked over to the Kate cum blanket. We hadn't even rolled it away after its last adventure. Now Kate was gonna get to re-christen it with her Katie cum.</p>
<p>Kate flopped down on the blanket. She barely even bothered to spread her legs.</p>
<p>"Just... Just do what you're gonna do. Let's get this over with," Kate said.</p>
<p>I noticed the slightest bit of juice leak out of her cunt. Maybe Kate wasn't so upset about this. Maybe Kate's big turn on was being angry.</p>
<p>I got up off the floor stood over her. My cock made a shadow across her gorgeous chest. And stomach. And pussy. Like little Jason was marking all the places he'd be drooling over in a moment.</p>
<p>My GOD she was fucking perfect. Her brown hair splayed on the blanket beneath her. Her big blue eyes sneaking glances at my cock when she thought I wasn't looking. Those thick, blowjob lips.</p>
<p>Her enormous breasts sat high on her ribcage no matter how she positioned herself. Her areola were tight and almost rippling. Her nipples pointed straight to the sky.</p>
<p>Kate's tits were so great, they almost overshadowed her beautiful, bare twat. Her perfect pussy lips were practically pouting. Her clitty tentatively peaked out from behind the curtains to see if the audience was ready for her performance.</p>
<p>Kat's legs were long and tan and oh so fucking tight. He had robin egg blue painted toenails and an ankle bracelet (anklet?) that was really super sexy right now for some reason.</p>
<p>And there it was. Best overall body. Holy hell was I on the money when I gave her that award. I had spent all night in constant anticipation. I'd spent weeks, months, waiting for a moment like this.</p>
<p>Now I was going to slide into the girl I'd dreamt about my entire post-pubescent life. A girl that was so hot, guys who had never even seen her would fantasize about her when they jerked off. My best friend's girlfriend. Yeah. That was kind of a turn on, too. I won't lie.</p>
<p>My cock was so hard and long it was like walking around with a medieval torture device between me legs. My balls felt so heavy, I was sure I had enough sperm to fill up a swimming pool. I only prayed that I'd be able to hold off. Five minutes, God. Give me five good minutes. I stayed so patient all night. Let me stay patient just a little longer.</p>
<p>I stood over her, admiring my prize. I saw her sneak her legs a little wider.</p>
<p>Oh Kate.</p>
<p>I knelt down. I had dreamt of her for so long. Since I we met as freshmen in high school. I'd followed her around like a puppy for four years. Done everything for her. All for one big lousy payoff—she starting fucking my best friend.</p>
<p>Oh Kate. Oh Katie.</p>
<p>I started to slide forward. Then I remembered: condom. Kate wouldn't touch a cucumber without protection. She wasn't gonna let alone let me stick my bad boy in her bare.</p>
<p>Suddenly Emma dropped down right next to me. Without even a warning, Emma grabbed my cock.</p>
<p>Shit. We really needed to have that talk.</p>
<p>"Hang on there extra super big, big bro," Emma said.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>She smiled at me. Seriously? What the hell was going on here? I looked up. Everyone else was sort of milling around, waiting for us to get going. Ashley looked aroused. Kristen looked nervous. Sam was way in the back. He looked pissed.</p>
<p>"Sam's really upset," Emma told me.</p>
<p>"So I shouldn't go through with this?" I asked, "I don't remember him holding back for me."</p>
<p>"He wasn't about to do your girlfriend," Emma said. She gave me a little squeeze.</p>
<p>My cock pulsed happily in her hand. What did he know, the big dope? If he had any idea of what Emma was holding him back from, he'd have spit in her face.</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>"So I should stop," I said.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying that...necessarily," Emma smiled. She used her free hand to brush the bangs out of her face. God she was sexy. Shit. No. No she wasn't. She was just my sister and she was amazing.</p>
<p>"I just want to make sure you know what you're getting into," Emma said.</p>
<p>Emma squeezed my cock a little tighter. I turned to look at her. Her eyes blazed.</p>
<p>"I guess what I'm saying is... Look, we all had a lot fun tonight."</p>
<p>I guffawed.</p>
<p>"No. Really. We did. I mean, the people who didn't have fun...maybe there's a reason for that. And maybe you think we didn't notice, but trust me—anyone who matters knows you did yeoman's work tonight. You really really did."</p>
<p>"What does that even mean? Yeoman's work? I cleaned the dishes? I poured the drinks?"</p>
<p>"No no no no no. All night, every time, you only thought about one thing—everyone else's pleasure. It wasn't just keeping the drinks filled or the place clean or inventing a game, on the spot, that everyone could play and enjoy. You made sure that everyone felt good about themselves. Their bodies. Their choices. You made everyone feel safe.</p>
<p>"You even told Sam he had a nice ass."</p>
<p>OK, I didn't remember actually telling him that, but sure. Why not?</p>
<p>"Meanwhile, I sat out maybe the whole game just because Kate made me feel shitty about my boobs. I let a lot of stupid shit happen. I shouldn't have."</p>
<p>"Let me finish. Kristen pushed everyone else to do stuff, but wouldn't do anything, herself. I don't know if I'll ever forgive Ashley for bullying Kristen and me into that stupid kiss.</p>
<p>"Then Kate, that selfish bitch, spent the whole night trying to please herself or piss off everyone else."</p>
<p>"Emma, that's not fair."</p>
<p>"That's how I saw it. And Sam? Well Sam made sure that he got his, didn't he?"</p>
<p>I couldn't help but notice she was still caressing my cock. Ordinarily, I would be pissed that she wasn't at least stroking it, but at this point I was pretty sure she was one good rub away from triggering my cannon and end of all my fun</p>
<p>"But you? You never got off. Not because you didn't have the opportunity. You were so focused on everyone else's happiness that you stiffed yourself."</p>
<p>"Stiffed, huh?"</p>
<p>"Very stiff," Emma said. She gave my cock a squeeze.</p>
<p>"You're a good guy, Jason. A really good guy. But maybe...maybe I don't want you to be a good guy tonight."</p>
<p>"You want me to be, like, a jerk?"</p>
<p>"No," Emma said, "I just mean that I—and by I, I mean we, the people whose opinion really matters—we all want to make sure you go ahead and get yours. OK?"</p>
<p>"What does that even mean?" I was still so confused—maybe because all my brain blood had quit early and raced off to be cock-and-balls blood.</p>
<p>"Go ahead and get yours?" Emma asked, "Pretty sure you can figure that one out all by yourself."</p>
<p>Emma gave my cock one last good tug and then slapped me hard on the ass. Well there it was then—either the best or the worst pre-game speech I'd ever gotten. At least the slap on the ass was par for the course.</p>
<p>"We doing this thing or what?" Kate called from somewhere north of Mt. Boobmore.</p>
<p>"Keep your pants on," I said.</p>
<p>"Little late for that!" Kristen called out. Wow, she really was an instigator. Maybe I would give her a little incitement of my own after all of this was over.</p>
<p>I took my cock in my hand—hard as nails, hot as hell, longer than I'd ever fucking seen it before—and guided myself forward.</p>
<p>My fingers grazed her moist, pudgy lips. It was a weird sensation. I was used to brushing against pubic hair well before feeling full on vagina. Benefit of going bare, I guess.</p>
<p>I slowly slid the backs of my fingers up her crack, getting the lay of the land. She wasn't steaming by any means. Compared to Emma she was bone dry. But Kate was feeling pretty wet, all things considered. I decided to warm her up a little before going in. I wanted to fuck the girl, not hurt her. Not in that way, anyway.</p>
<p>Her vulva was open and her clit was out, but neither were necessary raring to go. I slowly worked my cock up and down her hot little slit—just like Ashley showed me, only from the other way around.</p>
<p>I heard Kate's breath catch. Felt her legs open a little more to let me inside. I did one more sweep with my penis. Even if she wasn't ready, I couldn't hold out any longer.</p>
<p>I shuffled forward slightly on my knees. I used my free hand to hold myself up. Only two parts of us were touching, beyond some incidental leg contact: Her pussy. My cock.</p>
<p>I slid myself up and into place. Kate was already panting pretty heavy. Her little clitty slid out and rubbed herself against my knuckles like an attention-starved kitty. I heard something like a sigh break through Kate's heavy breaths.</p>
<p>I gave my member a little wiggle with my right hand to make sure it was in the exact right spot to slam home. Then I let go.</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Very gently, I let myself fall a little forward. I felt her labia open along my shaft. My head slid in, like slipping a ring on a finger.</p>
<p>"Urrrrrrrgh" Kate groaned, a little growl of satisfaction and exasperation.</p>
<p>I recognized that groan. It was the same sound she'd made when I told her she could stay in the master bedroom. God that was hot.</p>
<p>I lowered myself a little further—my whole head was inside her now! Without even saying a word, Kate suddenly bent her knees up and spread them as far as she could go.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>I slid a little further in. Maybe a quarter of my cock was now inside Katie's little quim. She wrapped her arms around my biceps. Was she trying to pull me forward?</p>
<p>I kept waiting for resistance. Not that I thought she was a virgin. I've been inside enough women to know you don't just slam in. Even if she was really super aroused. It usually took a couple of good knocks for her cunny to welcome me in.</p>
<p>I doubted Kate was really super aroused. There was no foreplay. No build up. She couldn't possibly be this good to go.</p>
<p>Kate's head was still lying back on the blanket. I couldn't really see her face. Couldn't know what she was thinking.</p>
<p>I looked up. Emma was watching me. Smiling.</p>
<p>I leaned in a little more. Suddenly, I slipped the whole way in—top to tail.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Kate gasped, "OH! That's nice."</p>
<p>And there it was. I was buried to my balls inside Kate Williams. The hottest girl in high school. The object of my dreams. My best friend's girlfriend.</p>
<p>Holy fucking fuck.</p>
<p>I slid back a little. Amazed at how easily I had gotten in. She was so tight. I felt every little bump and ridge as I slid past. Her pussy seemed to clench at my dick as I dragged it out. Like she couldn't handle having me go. Couldn't bear being empty.</p>
<p>"Ohhhhhhhhh," Kate whined as I pulled back, leaving only my head in her.</p>
<p>Then I slid back in. Same pace. Maybe a little faster. Like I said, I wasn't going to last long. I needed to drag this out..</p>
<p>"Oh...that feels sssooooo good," Kate said as I plowed forward.</p>
<p>I was back in to my balls. The happy little fellows bounced off Kate's beautiful butt. The tip of my cock hit an end point—her cervix.</p>
<p>Her pussy was fully filled. She squeezed my cock like holding it in a fist. Don't let go. I don't think Kate even realized she was doing it.</p>
<p>All the way in. Leaned fully forward. My chest pressed into Kate's magnificent melons. My face hung right above hers. Kate is a tall girl. I'm still a bit taller. She's a good height for fucking. 5'8". My ideal screwing height. I'd have to add that to my dating profile.</p>
<p>Kate looked up at me. I was all the way in her. She couldn't hide herself. Her big blue eyes searched mine. Frantic with desire and passion. Confusion and fear. Fear of what?</p>
<p>I slid my hands around her sides. I ran them up to her chest. Squeezed her amazing breasts.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Sam said, "She bet a fuck, not a tit feel."</p>
<p>"Oh... Oh Sam. It's OK. OK baby? It's OK... oh GOD it is so much more than OK."</p>
<p>My hands engaged, I slipped back slightly. I rocked back and forth while I rubbed her tits. They hardly fit in my hands. I could have had two hands on each wrist and I might have come up short.</p>
<p>They were incredible. They broke the laws of physics. No breast could be so big yet so tight and firm. The universe didn't allow for such amazing, gravity-defying, incredibly sexy boobs.</p>
<p>I slid back even further. I ran my hands along Kate's tight behind. I put my lips to her breast. Her vagina seemed to sigh in frustration. Her boobs exulted in the ministrations of my mouth. I licked them. I tasted them. I sucked them in whole. I suckled at her little brown nipples. I worshipped at the altar of Kate's monstrous mammaries. I made my obeisance at the holy temple of titty.</p>
<p>Kate's legs still hung open. I could smell her sweet sweet puss. Strong and thick and glorious. It was such a heavy, heady mélange. It probably embarrassed the hell out of her to send out such a scent. That made me love it all the more.</p>
<p>Kate shuffled her bum a bit. Tilted. Tried to force more of my cock inside—to grind her clit against me.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>Go ahead and get yours.</p>
<p>Finally full of Kate's magnificent mounds, I slid my hands back up. I caressed their softness. Tickled her nips. Then I used my new fantastic friends as hand-holds and pulled myself back up. Filled Kate with my cock.</p>
<p>She gasped.</p>
<p>I smiled at down at my crush girl. She said nothing. Her eyes searched my face—perplexed. Hoping I'd explain something she couldn't understand. I retreated away from her. I drove right back in.</p>
<p>"Ohhhh. So good. So good," Kate said.</p>
<p>I bounced myself back and forth. Kate gripped my biceps. Hanging on.</p>
<p>"Ohhh so good," Kate moaned, "Why is it so good? It shouldn't be so much better..."</p>
<p>I started a rhythm—jamming back and forth. My balls were soaked in her girl cum.</p>
<p>"Ohhhh god. It...It's so good...How is it so...it just... Oh...Oh god..."</p>
<p>Kat's arms shot down. She grabbed my ass. Held me buried inside. She looked right up at me.</p>
<p>"Condoms," she said.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>In all the excitement it had completely slipped my mind. There was that moment, right before Emma interrupted me. I was going to ask about condoms. The sentence was still strapped into my mind, ready to be fired out.</p>
<p>"Guess I'm gonna need to borrow one of Sam's condoms."</p>
<p>But then Emma had grabbed my cock and told me to 'Go Get Yours' and Sam was glaring at me while Kate demanded I get started and then I was holding my cock and... The thought had simply slipped away. Until that moment.</p>
<p>I was inside Kate Williams. The girl of my dreams. The hottest girl in high school. My best friend's girlfriend.</p>
<p>Unprotected.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>Even Sam had never had her bareback.</p>
<p>But there we were. Skin to skin. Cock to cunny. Nothing in between. I tried to pull back a little. Kate held me tight.</p>
<p>"Sam," I gasped (God that cunt felt great. They were going to have to evict me. I would never leave of my own volition), "I'm not wearing a condom."</p>
<p>"Yeah, no shit asshole," Sam said.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you... Fuck just get me a fucking condom, would you?"</p>
<p>Sam started to sprint off.</p>
<p>"Wait!"</p>
<p>The whole room snapped back in shock.</p>
<p>"Wait, Sam. Don't. It's...it's ok," Kate said.</p>
<p>Kate looked at me. Her puss was wrapped around my bare cock like it could never let go.</p>
<p>"It's OK," she said.</p>
<p>"You're on the pill?" I asked.</p>
<p>"We always use condoms," Kate said.</p>
<p>Everyone was frozen in place. The world's strangest holiday card. Sam, halfway between racing into the hallway and turning back to the living room. Kristen and Ashley, sitting to the side. Fingers in their cunnies. Eyes wide with shock. Emma standing above us, hands at her sides, smiling contentedly. Me and Kate just lying there. All the way into the act. My cock in her pussy. Her breasts in my hands.</p>
<p>"It's ok," Kate said, "I don't want... Just...just pull out. Y'know? Pull out before you cum.</p>
<p>I searched her eyes. She was so dead serious. Go ahead and get yours, buddy. Go ahead and get yours.</p>
<p>I started to slide myself back. Get back into rhythm. Get her off and get this over with. I saw myself cumming on those incredible tits. I could more than live with that. Especially if she begged me for it.</p>
<p>"You're sure it's OK?" I asked.</p>
<p>Hey, I took high school health. Your penis puts out its little peeps all the time. Shit happens. You will knock her up. You will not pass GO. You will not get $200.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Kate said. She smiled at me, encouraging. It was a good smile. A warm smile. The kind of smile I always wished she'd save for me.</p>
<p>I started sliding again.</p>
<p>"She's like, really fucking fertile right now, man," Sam said, "Seriously. Her womb is like...primed. You couldn't buy a better day to breed her.</p>
<p>I looked back up at Kate.</p>
<p>She smiled at me as if to say, "Yup! But whatcha gonna do?"</p>
<p>Well, OK then. Get yours, indeed.</p>
<p>"I'll pull out," I promised.</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>I slid back a little more. Half my cock hung outside her passage of pleasure. My shaft was sticky with her essence.</p>
<p>"I will," I said, "I'll pull out."</p>
<p>Back a little more.</p>
<p>"When it's time," Kate said.</p>
<p>"Yeah," I said, "When it's time."</p>
<p>Back a little more.</p>
<p>"I'll pull out when it's time," I said.</p>
<p>Down to just the head now.</p>
<p>"Even a little before," I said, "I won't let you..."</p>
<p>She looked up at me. Her hands were still on my buttocks. I hadn't noticed that till now.</p>
<p>She gave my buns a tight squeeze, smiling all the while.</p>
<p>"It's ok," she said.</p>
<p>Then with one hard push she slammed me home.</p>
<p>"Oh motherfucking GOD! That feels good..." Kate cried.</p>
<p>Kate shifted back. She lifted up her ass. Started humping on my cock for all she was worth.</p>
<p>"Oh God. Oh God. Oh God,"</p>
<p>I found her rhythm. Matched my thrusts and parries.</p>
<p>Her hungry little pussy just grabbed and sucked and pulled at my cock as I pounded her. We made our own little orgasmic orchestra—Kate's cries. My grunts, The squish of my dick in her cunnie. The bangs of our bodies against the floor.</p>
<p>I thought Kate was out of surprises. Then she grabbed my face. Pressed my lips to hers. The perfect blowjob mouth is pretty perfect for kissing, too. Our tongues rolled over each other, matching the sloppy passion of our privates.</p>
<p>I thrust hard into her, ripping her mouth from mine</p>
<p>"Oh FUCK. So big!"</p>
<p>Another thrust.</p>
<p>"Oh FUCK. So thick!"</p>
<p>Another thrust.</p>
<p>"OH FUCK! So deep!" Kate screamed.</p>
<p>The head of my cock kept bumping up against her back wall. My dick was a marauder—trying to break into Kate's sacred cervix. I tried to hold back a little. To stop bruising her fertile belly. Kate just pulled me down harder.</p>
<p>I stopped caring. I stopped thinking. I just kept driving and driving and driving her down. Her breasts shook and wobbled and almost spun with every jackhammer thrust.</p>
<p>Kate took one of her hands off my ass. Slid it between our bouncing bodies. Took hold of her little clitty and rubbed. The tips of her fingers tickled my root</p>
<p>Her body bucked. Kate moaned and shook.</p>
<p>"Just... just a little one," Kate said. She kept jamming herself. She wasn't gonna stop.</p>
<p>Kat's little puss squeezed tighter. I wondered how it was possible. She pulled her hand off her clit and dragged it over my lips. Salty and sweet and oh so good. She took another little lick for herself. Put her hands back down on my thighs.</p>
<p>"Oh god! Oh Jason!"</p>
<p>"Oh Jason! Oh JJ... You loved me so bad back in high school..."</p>
<p>"God, yeah," I grunted. Still striving in and out.</p>
<p>"You followed me everywhere. My little bestie. Oh! Oh Jason...Oh I bet you wanted to fuck me so bad."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah."</p>
<p>"Did you? Did you want to shove that big steaming cock into my little hole? Did you want to stuff me full?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," I gasped, "Yeah."</p>
<p>"OH! Oh God! Oh, I bet you did. I bet you wanted to fill my steaming cunt so bad."</p>
<p>"Uh huh."</p>
<p>"You're so bad. I was just...just a teenager. Just a girl... You wanted to put your peenie in my pussy?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh."</p>
<p>"My friend. My little bestie. You can't put your peenie in my little pussy. You can't slide that cock in me without a condom. You're going to fill me up with all your fertile little bestie spermies?"</p>
<p>Oh god.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Oh yeah."</p>
<p>"Oh. Oh bestie. That's so bad. You're my bestie. You can't put a baby in me. You're my friend. My buddy. You can't put your peenie in me. You're gonna bust you're bestie's little cervix. You're gonna put a baby in her belly?"</p>
<p>I didn't have to even answer. My cock twitched so hard I'm pretty sure everyone saw Kate's pubis jump.</p>
<p>"Oh Jason. Oh JJ. Oh my little loyal bestie."</p>
<p>I pulled back. Slammed in hard. Our pubic bones bounced.</p>
<p>"OH! Not so little anymore. Oh ho ho ho ho. No. Not so little at all. OH! Big bestie! So big! So good! You have to keep fucking me."</p>
<p>"You have to keep giving me that amazing, wonderful enormous cock."</p>
<p>"I will," I gasped.</p>
<p>"You can't ever stop," she said.</p>
<p>Kate contracted and shook. Her legs popped up. Kate rested her legs on the small of my back.</p>
<p>"Bit of a bigger one, there."</p>
<p>Kate smiled the post-cum smile. Wide and bright and deep—from her eyes down to her knees.</p>
<p>We rutted on the floor. The blanket slid back and forth with us. Every time I looked into Kate's eyes, I saw this mix of lust and gratitude and fear.</p>
<p>Every time I looked up further I saw Emma. Smug.</p>
<p>"Ohhhhhhh Jason! Oh god that's...FUCK that's so good. Oh JJ. Oh I think I fucked up."</p>
<p>I slowed. Kate kept driving me. Kept pushing me harder.</p>
<p>"I fucked up so bad. I should have had you in high school. You would have had me so good.</p>
<p>"You wanted me so bad. Why didn't I want you? Oh Jason....ssssssoooooooo good."</p>
<p>"It's ok," I said.</p>
<p>"You wanted me so bad. I should have fucked you so good. Oh, baby, I fucked up. It's ok...OH!...it's okay. Just keep fucking me, baby. Just keep fucking me up. Just keep...fucking...me...UP!"</p>
<p>I was going and going. How was I still going? Then suddenly I wasn't going anywhere. A little tingle danced on the tip of my cock., A whole spark shot down to my balls.</p>
<p>"Oh god..." I slowed.</p>
<p>"What? What's wrong?" Kate asked.</p>
<p>"Getting close..."</p>
<p>"Oh. Ok. That's ok baby. Just...just hang on...Hold on for me. I'm almost there. Please baby. Just...please, oh god, I'm almost there."</p>
<p>"O...OK," I said.</p>
<p>Kate pulled at me. Drove me back and forth. Her tits looked ready to take off. I tried to keep pounding with her.</p>
<p>Every euphoric trip down her channel just got me closer. And closer.</p>
<p>My balls were aching again Tingling. My sperm start sliding up my cock. Almost like I had to piss. Holy fuck my balls felt fucking full.</p>
<p>"Oh Jason!" Kate cried, "Oh GOD I love your cock. I really truly do. I do. I love your cock. Don't let go! Oh god please just don't let go."</p>
<p>I thrust forward a little.</p>
<p>Kate drove me forward even further.</p>
<p>"I gotta pull out!" I shouted, "Oh god Kate I gotta pull out! I'm so close I'm so close I'm so close.</p>
<p>"Oh...oh...almost there," Kate whined. Her body twisted and curved. She twitched and stretched.</p>
<p>"Kate, oh Katie, I'm really really close. Oh Katie, please..."</p>
<p>"Oh Jason, baby."</p>
<p>Kate reached up. She stroked my cheek. Her legs closed tighter around my waist.</p>
<p>"Oh JJ. I'm gonna cum! I'm gonna CUM for YOU! I'm gonna CUM on your big hard COCK! Don't you want my cum, baby? My first cum on a real cock? Show me baby. Show me how bad you want my cum.</p>
<p>"I've never had a cock without a condom. Oh GOD it feels so good. Don't you want my cum? LET ME...Let me cum on my first real cock...oh GOD."</p>
<p>Her pussy fucking SQUEEZED when she said that.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna cum, Jason. Jason I'm gonna cum so hard. All...all those times...I don't...I never... Oh GOD...I mean, with my fingers...with Ash...but. But not like this. Not on a cock. Oh GOD I didn't think I could cum on a cock. Oh I need to cum on your cock so bad."</p>
<p>I thought I heard Sam choke behind me. I couldn't stop to look.</p>
<p>"Please. Please JJ. Please tell me it's OK.</p>
<p>"All those little cockies in my cunny. All those little peepees in my puss. And look...I'm cumming. I'm cumming on a cock. I'm cumming on YOUR big cock big bestie! Let me...let me give you...Please. Please I want you to...I need you to...my naughty little pussy needs my big bestie's big ol cock. Let me cum on your COCK! Oh God, PLEASE let me cum on your cock..."</p>
<p>"Kate!" I cried, "Katie! Katie bear!"</p>
<p>I was past the point of words. Kate's legs locked behind me. I tried to grab her attention. She was too far gone.</p>
<p>"Almost...almost..." she moaned.</p>
<p>I felt it. Felt it burst from my balls. Race up my shaft.</p>
<p>I tried to hold it at the head. I tried to wrench back.</p>
<p>Kate's legs held tight. Pushed my penis all the way inside. Balls to asshole. Skin to skin. Cock to uterus.</p>
<p>Kate wrapped me up like a constrictor. There was nothing I could do.</p>
<p>"It's...It's ok Katie. Cum for me. It's OK Katie bear. You can cum. Cum for your bestie. Show my how bad you want to cum."</p>
<p>"Oh...yyyyyyyes!" Kate cried.</p>
<p>Kate's pussy clenched. The dam burst. My cock unloaded into her. I'd held out for so long. My seed just shot out. Pumped her pussy full. White pearlescent cum fired out like water from a fire hose. My world went white. All I could see was in my mind's eye. My cock jammed up against her cervix. Painting her pussy with my fertile seed.</p>
<p>"OH! OH! OH! OH Jason" Kate cried.</p>
<p>"Oh JJ! Oh fuck. you're cumming in MMMMEEEEEEEE! GOD don't stop cumming in me..." she sobbed.</p>
<p>It felt more like pissing than cumming. Streams of sperm shot in her. I shook and howled. Squeezed her boobs like life itself. Drove my cock as deep as I could. Drove deeper. The animal need—the drive to reproduce—to spread myself into Kate's hot, hungry womb.</p>
<p>I buried my head into her bountiful breasts. My cock fired burst after burst. Kate cradled my head. Stroked my hair. Clutched my cock with her cunt.</p>
<p>Kate was rolling and shaking. We rocked with aftershocks. Held each other tight. Like suffering through a storm. My cum fed her cum. Her cum fed mine.</p>
<p>"Oh Jason. OH I can fucking feel you SHOOTING in me. Oh god...there's so much!"</p>
<p>Kate arched her back. She ground herself hard onto my cock.</p>
<p>"OOOHHHhhhhhhh. Oh fuck. My bestie is filling me up! I never... Oh god it feels so good."</p>
<p>I felt my stream subside. My cock throbbed. Gave a few final shots into her. Kate stroked my head. Held me like the baby I'd almost certainly just given her.</p>
<p>"Oh Jason, you came in me."</p>
<p>"I...I'm sorry," I said.</p>
<p>"You naughty boy. You put your dirty little peepee in my cunny. No condom. No pill. You pumped me full of your fertile, fantastic cum."</p>
<p>"I tried to..."</p>
<p>Kate giggled and then sighed.</p>
<p>"Oh god, Jason. Fuck. We have to do that again. Soon. Now."</p>
<p>"I think I might die now," I said.</p>
<p>We stayed in each other's arms. Stuck together with sweat and girl juice and cum.</p>
<p>Kate laughed. Sobbed. Held me tight.</p>
<p>She wouldn't let my cock leave her pussy.</p>
<p>Eventually we felt so hot and sticky, we had to separate. Emma helped me up. I thought she'd be pissed, but she seemed oddly pleased.</p>
<p>Kristen was still on the couch, red as a tomato, hands stuffed inside herself. I could tell just by looking she still hadn't cum.</p>
<p>Ashley was sitting next to Kristen on the couch, smiling like the pussy that swallowed the canary.</p>
<p>I looked around for Sam. I didn't see him.</p>
<p>I don't remember much after that. Pretty sure I passed out on the floor.</p>
<p>The last thing I remember thinking was that there was no way—no way, no how— we were gonna go for a round 2.</p>
<p>Next time: Round 2! Hey, remember all those things I said were never gonna happen? The blow jobs, the fingering, the fucking, the girl-on-girl? Yeah. All that stuff happens. Also, Magic Juice!</p>


<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>[Hey there Literotians. Well that took way longer than expected. Had a bunch of real life stuff get in the way but the story is now totally, finally complete. It'll definitely help to read part one, but I won't say it's strictly necessary. Once again, we've got horrible people doing wonderful things to each other. Or is that the other way around...</p>
<p>In any case, expect to see (read) some masturbation, voyeurism, incest, light bondage, oral, girl/girl, reluctance, first time, and group sex.</p>
<p>If you were wondering why the first part ended up in the Incest/Taboo category, well, this one should certainly help explain why.</p>
<p>As always, everyone here is over 18.</p>
<p>Good times.]</p>
<p>We're wrapped around each other, skin to skin. Tongues and hands. Cock and cunt. I keep pumping as hard as I can - just driving and driving and driving. Nothing comes. The woman beneath me moans and reaches. Writhes as I pound her.</p>
<p>Who am I fucking? Unattainable Kate? Ardent little Ashley? Chaste Kristen? Unbelievable Emma? Am I fucking my little sister, Em?</p>
<p>The girls keep shifting beneath me, one then the other. All of them at once.</p>
<p>I feel a hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>I need release so bad. Driving so hard I can barely feel anything except...</p>
<p>Someone is shaking me.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>I woke up with a million dollar hangover and a ten cent dick.</p>
<p>I was so spent, I felt flaccid from top to bottom. Covered in sweat and... well, probably all sorts of fluids. I looked at my crotch, so sure it had just been engaged in something elicit. But no. Just a dream. My little man looked how I felt - joyous, remorseful, tired, energized. Embarrassed. Emboldened.</p>
<p>Someone was rubbing my shoulder. I sat up.</p>
<p>Kate. My high school best friend. My all time number one crush. My best friend's girlfriend. The woman I'd fucked just... hours before, if the clock in the cabin was right. Fuck.</p>
<p>I groaned.</p>
<p>"Ohhhh, Kate. I can't do this right now. My head is killing me."</p>
<p>She smiled at me patiently, like an overburdened mother. Full of love and exasperation.</p>
<p>"I need a ride back to shore," Kate said, "Before everyone else gets up."</p>
<p>"Oh. Oh, yeah. No problem. Look...I...I'm sorry. I shouldn't have..."</p>
<p>"Listen," Katie interrupted me, "I've had a lot of sex in my life. Some ok. Some bad. Nothing like what we did. Nothing even close. So there's lots of stuff you get to say now, but sorry isn't allowed. Understood?"</p>
<p>I smiled.</p>
<p>"You want me to get Ashley?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, she told me she wants to stay a bit longer."</p>
<p>"Oh. OK. Just let me just get some clothes on and we can get going."</p>
<p>It took a couple of pulls for the dinghy's engine to turn over. The shout of combustion seemed like sacrilege in the soft pink of early morning. I almost shushed it out of habit.</p>
<p>Kate stepped into the little boat like someone who usually stays on shore. She smiled as she settled. The engine was so loud, we had to stay quiet. Kate's blue eyes seemed brighter than I remembered. Her arms and shoulders loose. I was a bundle of nerves, all coiled up and haphazardly wrapped. Someone had done poor wire work on me. My plumbing felt fairly fucked, as well.</p>
<p>I throttled the boat back to silence as we edged toward the shore. Just a low hum and the dripdrops of the water - the accusing tweets of the early birds.</p>
<p>"Look, Kate. Katie, I really... Last night... That wasn't what I wanted. I really am sorry."</p>
<p>"You tell me you're sorry again and I'm punching you right in that perfect penis," Kate said.</p>
<p>"Sorry."</p>
<p>Kate made a show of making a fist.</p>
<p>"You know I had fun. You just don't want to admit it," Kate said.</p>
<p>"If it was so much fun, why are you sneaking out so early?"</p>
<p>"I'm pretty sure you know why."</p>
<p>I stared off across the ocean. The sun was barely up, dripping yellow over the calm cool water. Gulls called in the distance. I wanted... I wasn't sure what I wanted.</p>
<p>"You're worried about me," Kate said, "Don't. Maybe the thing I liked about you most last night is that, for once, you weren't worried about me. I'm fine. I'm not going anywhere. Well, I'm going to CVS. But after that, not anywhere."</p>
<p>"Are we..."</p>
<p>"We're fine. Nothing more, nothing less. You don't owe me anything. Except, well, maybe another go round? On a bed this time? I promise I'll make it worth your while."</p>
<p>Kate leaned forward on the boat and kissed me. Pressed her lips to mine. Then sat back. Nothing more. Nothing less.</p>
<p>We bounced against the dock and I tied the boat off. Kate stood and started to step off.</p>
<p>"You and Ashley, eh?" I asked.</p>
<p>Kate smiled, sheepishly.</p>
<p>"Just... Not a lot. Just roommates," Kate said. She shrugged.</p>
<p>"She seems like a nice girl."</p>
<p>"That girl is anything but nice. If you haven't seen it by now, you will soon."</p>
<p>"Don't think I'll be seeing much more today. Maybe ever."</p>
<p>"Oh please," Kate said, still turned halfway on the dock, body twisted away, eyes right on mine, "You keep acting like last night was some sort of... I dunno. Catastrophe. I hate to break it to you - people had fun last night. You had fun last night. Acting all guilty isn't fooling anyone. If anything, it's probably pissing people off. I can promise you - somehow, someway - even if you can't see it, someone is gonna get things going again. Because everyone wants to. Yourself included."</p>
<p>I smiled, despite myself.</p>
<p>Kate pressed forward. "I know you think you're gonna go back to the boat and, I dunno, help people pack up and leave. It's not going to happen. Things are gonna... ramp up again. Trust me. And that's ok. Have fun. Go ahead and get yours, Jay Bird. Whatever. Just promise me something."</p>
<p>"Well, two things. The first is, y'know, what we talked about. Me. And the bed. Boston isn't so far from DC. You can even take the train."</p>
<p>"Yeah. I mean, of course."</p>
<p>"But here's the other thing... Look, I saw you and Emma. I see how she looks at you. How you look at her."</p>
<p>"Kate, I..."</p>
<p>"Don't. Just don't. We all see it. There's nothing wrong with it. OK, no, there's a LOT wrong with it. I'm not gonna judge. Everybody goes through phases, or whatever. Hell, I have a friend at college who still trades 'favors' with her older brother."</p>
<p>I cocked my head.</p>
<p>"No, not Ashley. Jeez. Anyway, look, I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life. But Jason. You can't fuck her, OK? You just... you just can't."</p>
<p>"I never..."</p>
<p>"Little Emmy wants you really bad, Jay. And I think if you would just be honest with yourself for once you'd see you really want her, too. You can't. I know, I know. I'm like, the last person Em wants you to listen to. But I'm saying this for her sake. You could really fuck her up, like, in all senses of that word. You could destroy her. Her whole life. Everything. You need to be the big brother here. You need to keep her safe."</p>
<p>"Yeah. No, I... Yeah. I know. I just... OK. Thanks Kate."</p>
<p>"Oh no," Kate said and wiggled her bum ever so slightly, "Thank you."</p>
<p>Emma was waiting for me when I got back to the boat, sitting on deck and squinting in the still-early sun.</p>
<p>"I knew your magic sword would slay the wicked witch," she smiled. She grabbed my cock as she said 'magic sword.'</p>
<p>"Oh," she whined, "he's all sleepy. Well don't worry, I have ways to wake him up."</p>
<p>"Em," I placed my hand between the two of us, "Let's... Can we talk for a sec?"</p>
<p>I lead her downstairs to her cabin. Kristen was already up and in the shower. I imagined all of us would need a good washing after last night. I shut the door, both on the girl and on my urge to sneak a little peek. I mean, I'd already seen the buxom beauty naked, held her enormous and wonderful breasts in my hands. Did I really need to sneak a look at her through the tinted glass and steam of the shower? Apparently yes, yes I did.</p>
<p>Emma sat on her bunk, staring up at me. I sat next to her and held her hand - both for support and to keep it out of my crotch.</p>
<p>"Look. Em..."</p>
<p>"Don't say it," Emma said, "Just don't."</p>
<p>"I have to. This... it can't go on."</p>
<p>"That bitch! What did she say to you?"</p>
<p>"Nothing I didn't already know."</p>
<p>I felt Emma's hands try to escape mine. I heard her start to sniffle.</p>
<p>"I can't... Look. Imagine it. OK? We're together. Now, what do you do when Mom and Dad ask if you're seeing anyone? Or when they ask to meet him? What about when your girlfriends want to hook you up? Or ask about that mystery guy you're seeing? You'd have this secret life... your whole life. And that's if everything works out perfectly."</p>
<p>"I'll make new friends," Emma said. She was crying now. Really crying. The shower shut off in the distance. I hardly noticed.</p>
<p>"And when they ask how we met?"</p>
<p>"I'll lie," Emma said.</p>
<p>"Your whole life will be a lie," I said, "Our whole lives... What if we had kids?"</p>
<p>"So what?"</p>
<p>"What would we tell them? This is your Dad? This is your Uncle?"</p>
<p>"You don't want to be a Duncle?" Emma asked, she laughed a little. Then she started crying even harder.</p>
<p>"I love you, JJ," she said, "I'm not... stupid. I know I'm not supposed to. But I do."</p>
<p>"I know. I love you, too."</p>
<p>"Then WHY?"</p>
<p>"Because I love you."</p>
<p>She shoved me off the bed. Pushed me out of the cabin. Slammed the door. Her sobbing echoed all over the boat.</p>
<p>I found Sam above deck. He was on one of the benches on the prow, shirtless, wearing pilot-style sunglasses. He looked like an American Eagle ad.</p>
<p>"Emma?" he asked.</p>
<p>"You heard?" I sat next to him.</p>
<p>"The fucking Ukraine heard."</p>
<p>"Look, Sam..."</p>
<p>"Don't, OK. Just don't. What happened. Whatever. Fucking cunt. She was angry. So was I. But I would never just... I dunno. Just. Look, I don't want to hear you're sorry."</p>
<p>"We were friends before that bitch. We're friends now," Sam said.</p>
<p>"OK. You're sure about that?"</p>
<p>"No. Maybe. I dunno. I just...I don't fucking care right now, OK?"</p>
<p>"She didn't make you happy. You deserve someone who makes you happy."</p>
<p>"Yeah. Yeah I know. Still hurts. Bitch couldn't even bother to say goodbye."</p>
<p>"I think she was scared. I think she knows what she did and she doesn't know what to do about it."</p>
<p>"And you? You know what you did?" Sam sat up now, glasses falling down his nose, deep brown eyes just piercing through.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I literally fucked up my friendship. Look, you knew how I felt about her. Know I... It doesn't make up for what I did. You're my best friend. The rest of that shit... it's just shit. It doesn't matter. I fucked up."</p>
<p>"And if it happened all over again?" Sam asked, "The girl, the crush, the chance to fuck her right in front of me..."</p>
<p>I didn't answer.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I know. I'd have done the same thing. Shit."</p>
<p>"Shit."</p>
<p>"Well, at least we're honest," Sam said. He pushed his glasses back up his nose. Leaned back against the prow.</p>
<p>"Honesty doesn't seem to be worth much right now," I said.</p>
<p>"Emma? She'll get over it."</p>
<p>"And you?"</p>
<p>"... We'll be all right," Sam said, "I'm mad at you. Of course I am. I'm sure you were mad at me when I started dating Kate. I wish you'd said something then, instead of... Whatever. I don't have a time machine. I can't change what's happened. I'm tired of being mad at people."</p>
<p>He extended his hand for a shake. I hugged him instead.</p>
<p>"You know," I said, "there are three beautiful women down there. And you're a single man."</p>
<p>"You're saying I should fuck my problems away?"</p>
<p>"There are worse solutions," I said, "And you've got plenty of condoms."</p>
<p>"Fuck that, man," Sam said, "I'm never wearing a fucking condom again."</p>
<p>Emma's door was still shut when we went back down. I could hear her and Kristen whispering through the walls. The yacht was littered with empty liquor bottles, forgotten food and trash. It looked like the after party for an Aerosmith cover band. Sam and I did our best to clean.</p>
<p>I rolled up the Kate cum blanket. Put the hand job chair back by its other, unsoiled mates. Found the deck of cards and threw it in the trash.</p>
<p>I was so, so done.</p>
<p>Then Ashley stepped into the room wearing just a towel. It was wrapped loosely, just barely revealing the shape of her perfect breasts. Her blonde curly hair still seemed springy through the soak. My poor penis twitched weakly as she passed.</p>
<p>"Hey there, lover," Ashley teased. I couldn't tell if she was talking to Sam or me or maybe both of us. She bounced off, a dream, promising to turn into a nightmare.</p>
<p>A bit later and we'd all rotated places. Sam was in Emma's room, talking things out. Kristen and Ashley were above deck getting sun. I tried to rest on the couch. I just stared at Emma's door, like I could will myself into X-ray vision. They spent so long in there, I thought maybe they might be fucking.</p>
<p>Oh God, please, don't let them be fucking.</p>
<p>"We want to play again," Ashley said. I looked up. She and Kristen had snuck down while I was otherwise obsessed. Ashley was wearing a tiny orange two-piece with ties on the sides that just begged me to unwrap her. Her ringlet curls bounced as she talked and her breasts - still amazing, even covered - did their best to match the rhythm.</p>
<p>"Play what?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Don't be dumb," Emma said. She was standing in the suddenly open doorway, wearing a pair of green soccer shorts that showed off her oh-so-amazing legs. Her breasts barely poked out from behind her pink t-shirt, standing at ready attention despite the fact Em was clearly not wearing a bra. Her brown hair was up in a ponytail, like always. Her face was red and wet and... fuck, somehow it made me want her even more.</p>
<p>Stupid penis/brain.</p>
<p>"I threw away the cards."</p>
<p>"We found a fresh deck!" Kristen was a good head taller than everyone else in the room. Her amazing straight blond hair hung all the way down to her bottom. She was wearing a navy one-piece swimsuit that was supposed to be demure, but only better outlined her amazing assets. Kristen held the cards up like she was posing for her awards ceremony. A gold medal in fucking. Best Olympic sport ever.</p>
<p>"Fine," I said, as if I was really suffering from having to re-start our little sex orgy.</p>
<p>We sat back in our little circle. Same seats, minus Kate. I dealt. I think we all believed we'd just pick up from where we left off the night before. I mean, maybe not THAT far out, but still.</p>
<p>Instead, people weren't even betting socks. Hell, people weren't even looking each other in the eye. I'd seen circles like this before. It usually ended with someone getting fired. Or buried.</p>
<p>We went through a round in about ten minutes. Emma was short a sock. Ashley kissed Sam on the cheek. Booooorrrrring.</p>
<p>"This sucks," Emma said.</p>
<p>We all agreed, nodding sadly.</p>
<p>"You have any more pot?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>Emma shook her head.</p>
<p>"But..." she began. She looked pointedly at Sam. He nodded. What was going on with those two?</p>
<p>"Well," Emma continued, "You see, there is this other stuff I brought, y'know, in case of emergency.."</p>
<p>We all sat down in the kitchen. There was a small glass, about a tumbler, in front of each seat.</p>
<p>"OK," Emma said, "Here's how this is going to work."</p>
<p>She took out a large container. It was clearly heavy. If Emma struggles with lifting something, it must be frickin' loaded.</p>
<p>She poured about half a glass full for each of us. The liquid was thick and green. It looked more like a juice cleanse than a party drink.</p>
<p>"This," Emma continued, "is magic juice."</p>
<p>"Magic juice?" I asked.</p>
<p>"That's what we call it. Yes," Emma said.</p>
<p>"Oh no," Kristen said. She'd clearly been introduced before. She eyed her glass warily.</p>
<p>"What makes it magic?" Ashley asked, "Y'know, besides the eye of newt, toe of frog, etc."</p>
<p>"Nothing weird," Emma said, "It's just... y'know, the usual. Alcohol. Some other stuff. I've made it before for, like, parties. It's totally safe, I swear. Just fun. Get a little drunk, a little high, you're not gonna be like... I dunno, tripping balls and rubbing the wallpaper or anything."</p>
<p>"Shit Em," I said, "I thought you were studying law, not pharmacology."</p>
<p>"I don't do drugs," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"Oh, come on Krissy, you've seen this before it's totally harmless," Emma said.</p>
<p>"No drugs... Kristen, you drank a ton of alcohol last night," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"And you smoked, like, a lot of weed," Sam said.</p>
<p>"I know, but... That's different," Kristen said, "It's not like... I dunno... hard stuff."</p>
<p>"Good lord." Ashley threw up her hands.</p>
<p>"Exactly," I said. I looked at Ashley, pointedly. She rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Why did you bring all this stuff onboard?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Bunch of guys and girls on a boat," Emma said, "I guess I figured it was going down, y'know?"</p>
<p>She eyed Sam.</p>
<p>"So we just... drink it?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yup," Emma said.</p>
<p>"And then go play cards."</p>
<p>"Sure. Or watch a movie or go tan, whatever. Just um, maybe don't swim. Y'know. In case."</p>
<p>Oh this was so not good. I've known my sister for all 19 of her years. The face she was making now... that was the so not good face. See, Emma's the good girl. She's got good grades. She's a heck of an athlete. Pretty. Smart. She's the parent's dream.</p>
<p>All things that Emma is, yet also hates being hung with. The good girl follows the rules and does as she's told and in the end, the good girl ends up in a bad marriage with a bunch of crappy kids and a nowhere career.</p>
<p>Good girl sucks.</p>
<p>So occasionally, when things sort of collapse down in just the right way, a very different Emma comes out: mischievous, aggressive, dirty Emma. Oh lord.</p>
<p>"Well," Sam said, "whenever someone gives me some mysterious glass of green goop and orders me to drink it, I mean, that's a no-lose situation right there."</p>
<p>"That's the spirit!" Emma said. She threw back her drink in one go. It gave her a bit of a green mustache. She licked it away with her cute, thin, pink tongue.</p>
<p>Best tongue!</p>
<p>Oh God. Here we go again.</p>
<p>"On three," Sam said.</p>
<p>We all drank. It tasted like broccoli and beer. Patchouli and smoke. Healthy and terrible all at once.</p>
<p>To my credit, I only retched once after drinking it. Then we sat there. Stared at each other.</p>
<p>"Well, that was a bust," Sam said.</p>
<p>"Damn it," Emma said, "I must have mixed it up wrong or something."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it," I said. I squeezed her shoulder before I realized I should really not be squeezing her shoulder.</p>
<p>"We can have plenty of fun without drugs and alcohol," I said.</p>
<p>"Speak for yourself," Ashley said, smiling.</p>
<p>"Maybe I just under did it. One more shot?" Emma asked.</p>
<p>We all downed a second glass-full.</p>
<p>Still nothing.</p>
<p>We got up from the kitchen and went back upstairs to the deck. The magic juice may have come out flat, but everyone seemed to be in a better mood. Maybe it was a placebo effect, but everyone seemed calmer. More relaxed. I poured out some white wine. Kristen put together some sandwiches. We lounged in the sun and let ourselves be pickled.</p>
<p>We were all in our bathing suits now. Ashley still wearing the bright orange tie-ups and Kristen in the one-piece blue thing. Both suits were so different, yet seemed to show off each girl's impressive mammaries in their own unique ways. Sam and I were in trunks and nothing else. Emma had changed into a fairly conservative forest green bikini that made her emerald eyes seem to shine.</p>
<p>I went up to get another drink. I felt the boat tip slightly, but it wasn't moving. My knees were wobblier than the water. How much had I drunk, exactly?</p>
<p>Ashley grabbed my arm and held me steady. I looked over, surprised. Something about her touch, her fingers on my arm. Warm and electric. Placid and throbbing.</p>
<p>"You OK?" she asked me.</p>
<p>"Eh. Kate's gone. Emma's pissed. I don't know what to do with Sam..."</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>"No no no. That's not what I meant," Ashley said. She looked pointedly at my crotch.</p>
<p>"I pretty sure my little man is down for the count," I said, "One big blowout and..."</p>
<p>I looked down. I was like a sundial. An oil derrick. A flagpole stacked on top of the Washington Monument. How had I not noticed this?</p>
<p>Then I did notice.</p>
<p>I was stiffer than stiff. My balls were knotted and full. I looked again at Ashley. The nipples of her ever-so-perfect pert parts were pushing through her top like buds at springtime.</p>
<p>"Holy fuck," I said. My cock jerked, happily</p>
<p>"Pretty much," Ashley said.</p>
<p>I looked around. Sam had his hands over himself, like he was giving his penis some shade. Kristen and Emma were practically rolling on the deck.</p>
<p>"Hey guys!" Emma called out, "I think we need to go play some cards."</p>
<p>We sprinted downstairs, jumbling each other on the way down.</p>
<p>The night before, my junk had felt ready to burst into flame. Now it was on fucking fire. I kept reaching down and squeezing my cock. I couldn't stop.</p>
<p>We flew into our old circle as if we might actually be playing cards. Emma, my little faucet, looked like she'd peed her bikini bottoms they were so dark. Ashley didn't even bother with bashfulness, she started rubbing her crotch against the carpet as soon as she flopped down on the ground. She strained and shuddered with each drag. Kristen, poor Kristen, seemed unable to understand any of this. She was bright pink, holding her knees up to her chin, rocking back and forth.</p>
<p>"Holy fucking fuck," Emma said.</p>
<p>"Just... just deal the fucking cards," Ashley told me, her voice tremulous. The sunlight bursting through the windows somehow accentuated the darkness of the room. I could still see all I needed to.</p>
<p>I quickly shuffled, then practically threw a card at each person.</p>
<p>"Fucking magic juice," Sam said. He was holding his crotch like a little boy that desperately has to pee.</p>
<p>Ashley took one look at her card and threw it on the ground.</p>
<p>"Fuck!"</p>
<p>"I think... I think maybe we shouldn't play," Emma said.</p>
<p>"Are you fucking kidding me?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>"No. I mean... I mean maybe everyone ought to... y'know... Relieve some pressure first," Emma said, "I mean... oh! This... This is just cruel."</p>
<p>She was already demonstrating what she had in mind, right hand jammed into the waistband of her bikini.</p>
<p>"Thank fucking God!"</p>
<p>Ashley didn't even bother to wait for group consensus. She just ripped off her bottoms and plunged her fingers into her juicy puss.</p>
<p>"Ahhhhhh," she sighed. Her face relaxed. Her legs tightened.</p>
<p>Sam shucked his shorts with an angry grunt. His hand was flying up and down his shaft so fast you couldn't even see what he was working.</p>
<p>I reached into my trunks and grabbed hold. I couldn't help it. It was weird. I didn't want to. I just... needed to. I was a thirsty man gulping down water, knowing I'd be puking it back up and too dehydrated to care. I just... I couldn't stop myself.</p>
<p>At least I had the decency to keep it in my shorts, I thought.</p>
<p>"Ahhhhh"</p>
<p>Ashley again. She was spanking her clitty like the naughtiest little clitoris that ever clitted.</p>
<p>Emma. Her bottoms were gone, as well. Her digits squished and squirted as she jammed one hand into her hungry puss and the other pinched and squeezed at her clit.</p>
<p>I ran my hand up and down my cock. Fuck that felt good. FUCK. I couldn't get the rhythm going. There went decency along with my shorts.</p>
<p>Everyone was out and on display.</p>
<p>Except Kristen.</p>
<p>Kristen was sitting there, rocking back and forth faster and faster. She glanced left and right: prey surrounded by hungry predators, waiting for them to feed.</p>
<p>"I can't... I don't..."</p>
<p>I couldn't tell if she was telling herself or us. Her body was certainly trying to help her along. She might rock about for hours and not get there, but damned if it wasn't going to try.</p>
<p>"Ffffffffuck. Fuck fuck," Emma said. She was still rubbing. So was I. We all were, in an orchestra of squicking and slapping and stroking. Ooohing and ahhhing and moaning.</p>
<p>Ashley was the first to go.</p>
<p>"Oh," she said.</p>
<p>Ashley snapped still and shuddered. Her head thrown back. Silent scream. Whole body shaking.</p>
<p>Then she fell back. Stretched languidly.</p>
<p>"Ohhhhhhhhhh," she said.</p>
<p>Sam was next. He just grunted, then little white droplets went everywhere-his hand, his chest, Ashley.</p>
<p>"That's it... there's a good boy.</p>
<p>Ashley moaned contentedly as his sperm rained down over her legs and chest. She reached down and rubbed it into her tits. Took the rest into her mouth. A glob of sperm hung happily from one of her tight blonde curls.</p>
<p>Sam leaned back against the wall and sighed. His eyes glazed over.</p>
<p>Em and I were still going at it. Kristen was stuck in neutral.</p>
<p>"Uhhhhhhooooohhhhh," Emma cried.</p>
<p>"Please. I can't... I don't..."</p>
<p>Kristen sounded near tears. She pulled her swimsuit up to her stomach and drove her hand down into herself. Trying to mimic what Emma was doing. She rubbed her clit. Pumped her fingers. It was sloppy. Out of rhythm. She was playing the big show without ever showing up to rehearsals. The crowd was not going wild.</p>
<p>"You...you can do it Kris," Emma said, still rocking and rolling.</p>
<p>"I can't, Oh god, I can't," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"Sssssssoooo close," Emma said. She was really going at it. Sparks practically flew from her fingers.</p>
<p>"Please," Kristen said, "Please."</p>
<p>Suddenly I felt a hand on my arm.</p>
<p>"Jay."</p>
<p>It was Emma. Her juice was running down my forearm like we were standing in the rain.</p>
<p>"JJ," Emma said, "You've got to help Kristen, ok? Just... just help her out. Get her started."</p>
<p>I looked around the room, wondering why Em chose me and not someone better suited. Then I realized. Wait! What the fuck was I doing? I didn't want someone better suited. I wanted me!</p>
<p>I scrambled over to Kristen and sat across from her. We were both bottomless. I moved to adjust my cock. For a moment, it must have looked like I was getting ready to go in her. Kristen spread her thighs slightly, as if welcoming me in. Holy fuck!</p>
<p>I pulled her hands off her puss. It was a fight, like making her give up a favorite toy. Fingers bent, forearms bent, I helped her lift her arms above her head and then pulled her bathing suit up after them. Her breasts jumbled happily, then hid behind the thick blonde curtains of her hair.</p>
<p>Then I gently lowered her hands over to my own cock. Helped her clasp her fingers around it.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she said. She jumped back a little.</p>
<p>"It's so... I didn't..."</p>
<p>Kristen reached out again and took hold. My dick shook in appreciation. Carefully, she squeezed, then rubbed. Kristen didn't have tiny hands, but she could still stack both around my member. She looked nervous, driven. Desirous, afraid.</p>
<p>"It's ok," I said, "I'll help you if you'll help me."</p>
<p>She nodded. Tentative.</p>
<p>I wrapped my hands over hers, still clutching my shaft. I moved her hands up and down. Showed her the motion. I let go and she kept going.</p>
<p>"Ohhhhh. That's a girl," I told her. Her fingers, quick and long with Easter-pink nails, looked so fucking sexy on my dick I almost didn't need her to move them.</p>
<p>I reached across and found her snatch. It was dripping. Pungent. Her little hole was open and drooling. Practically screaming for satisfaction. I dipped my fingers inside and collected her juices. I spread them over her vulva. Paid special attention to her clit.</p>
<p>Fingering Kristen at that moment was like starting to write someone else's novel midstream. I knew how things were supposed to end but I wasn't really sure where she had left off or how she intended to get there.</p>
<p>Guys are easy. One quick lesson and Kristen was priming my pump like a porn star. She wasn't subtle or perfect, but fuck, she didn't need to be.</p>
<p>Girls... girls have a whole different erector set and it shows. Getting a girl off the first time is fucking hard. There's all sorts of steps and buttons and they all work differently. If a girl's never gotten herself off before? If she can't even tell you what she wants? Forget it. It's like building a Lamborghini. From scratch. Without the instructions.</p>
<p>I did my best. Her clit seemed ready for action so I used my thumb and started rubbing.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Kristen cried, "Oh... Oh God!"</p>
<p>At that moment I heard Emma start to cry out.</p>
<p>"Yes! Oh FUCK! There it is! There. It. Is!"</p>
<p>I risked glancing over and saw my little sis stiffen and tumble over onto her side, her hand still jammed between her legs.</p>
<p>"Oh fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck," she sobbed.</p>
<p>I turned my attention back to Kristen.</p>
<p>"Help," she said, needy. Full of desire and oh so afraid.</p>
<p>"A little lighter," I told her.</p>
<p>"A little harder," she told me.</p>
<p>I pressed down onto her clitty more.</p>
<p>"No no, not slower," I said, "just...loosen... Yeah. There it is. You've got it."</p>
<p>"Your penis it's so... so warm. So hard. So soft."</p>
<p>"You like it?"</p>
<p>"It's fucking awesome."</p>
<p>I was so shocked I almost dropped her clitty. She smiled at me, big and bold with bright blue eyes and shining white teeth. Where had this Kristen been hiding?</p>
<p>"Your... your puss is pretty fantastic, too."</p>
<p>Kristen smiled, then scooched forward, ever so slightly. I re-engaged my thumb on Kristen's clit, then swung my fingers down and placed my pointer in her pussy.</p>
<p>"Faster," she said.</p>
<p>I started pumping my finger in and out.</p>
<p>"Harder."</p>
<p>I added another finger. Her little snatch seemed somehow even tighter now. A mouth, suckling hard and hungry. She could have pulled an extra thick milkshake from straw to cervix at that moment.</p>
<p>I twisted my fingers up. Let them search a little. It moved my thumb off her clit. Kristen clutched my cock as hard as she could, reaching for a railing before the fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>I brought my free hand up and started rubbing her clitty again. Kristen loosened her grip a little. I traced my fingers along the walls of her cunt. Hunting.</p>
<p>"Oh," Kristen said. Her pretty, agile hands stopped pumping.</p>
<p>"Keep going," I said.</p>
<p>"Uh huh."</p>
<p>There it was. The spongy little square from which all goodness goes.</p>
<p>I pressed down with the pads of my fingers.</p>
<p>"oh! OH SHIT!" Kristen cried, "I... Oh! ffffFFFUCK!"</p>
<p>I started rubbing back and forth on her g spot. Moved my thumb in time on her clit. Pinching her power button between my fingers. I had finally figured out how to get Kristen's instrument playing and now? Now I was going to fucking JAM.</p>
<p>Kristen was shaking now. Panting. She couldn't keep her rhythm on my shaft. More like holding on for dear life.</p>
<p>"oh FUCK!" Kristen cried, "Keep... Keep rubbing. Faster. Faster. Like that. Oh... oh something is... oh god I think I might..."</p>
<p>Then suddenly she stopped, as if frozen in place. She looked up at me, bright blue eyes glowing through golden waterfalls of beautiful blonde, shining hair.</p>
<p>"I want you to cum," she told me, "I NEED you to cum."</p>
<p>"OK," I said, not stopping, "But you first."</p>
<p>She eyed me for a moment. Smiled sort of shyly.</p>
<p>Threw her head back and howled.</p>
<p>"OHHHHHHHH! Oh SHIT. Oh my fucking GOD."</p>
<p>Then she snapped back, bearing down. Her pussy clenched at my fingers. Hard. Snapping down.</p>
<p>"Huuuuurrrrrrrrr," Kristen growled. Her immense breasts shook and trembled. Her eyes rolled back into her head.</p>
<p>Then her hands shot out, grabbed my cock, and started pumping it for dear life. Up down. Up down. UP... Sperm raced to me shaft and then rocketed up and out - blasting forth. A fire hose of fertility.</p>
<p>"Oh FUCK!" I cried. My eyes rolled back, the pleasure peaked, radiated out from my cock all the way up my arms, to the tips of my fingers, the flats of my feet - all in tension, and yet totally tranquil. My penis pistoned in Kristen's unpracticed hands. I practically painted the pretty girl with my powerful pearlescence. Blast after blast of seed splattered over Kristen's freckled cheeks. Her pointed, pinkish nipples. Her golden waterfalls of hair.</p>
<p>It was fucking glorious.</p>
<p>Kristen shook and shuddered with every blast, like every splash caused her pussy to just quiver and ache at what was lost, left useless outside her ravenous womb.</p>
<p>Then Kristen and I collapsed backwards, spent. I looked around. Everyone was in the same position. Blown back. We looked like a party, post-grenade.</p>
<p>"Fucking magic juice," I said.</p>
<p>"Fuck yeah," Sam said.</p>
<p>"Maybe we... maybe we shouldn't have had the second drink," Emma said.</p>
<p>"I think the first was far too much," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"Whatever. It's over."</p>
<p>I looked down at my cock - sticky with my own juice, a little red from Kristen's impassioned rubbing. But also, still, stuck in sun dial mode. Maybe even worse than before.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>It wasn't the end. Just the beginning.</p>
<p>"Finally," Ashley said, "Can we play some fucking cards?"</p>
<p>It was just past noon. It was hot and dark under the heavy sunlight. The boat already stank of sex. We were all covered in (mostly) our own juices and nearly nothing else. Ashley and Emma were bottomless. Ashley's cute little blonde pubes looked damp, darker. Emma was mostly shaved, just a little brown patch upon her pubis. They both still had their tops on. Kristen had tossed away her bathing suit during our little tete a tete - I imagined my parents would probably find it under a couch on some far future weekend.</p>
<p>Sam and I had discarded our trunks in the moment. We were both naked and hardly cared. Sam's member was no more relaxed than mine. The girls didn't have erections (well, they almost certainly did, but the visible difference between an erect clit and a flaccid one is like figuring out if your coach class airplane seat is in its full, upright position). But the women all looked like a glacier post global warming: hard nipples from the cold, dripping pussies from the heat.</p>
<p>In that moment, right before the first deal, I made a decision. I would stop paying attention to everyone else and just focus on what I wanted. Kristen seemed raring to go and so I would give her a good spin. Sam wanted to show Ashley his moves and I wasn't going to stand in his way. That left Emma without a dance partner, but, well, I was free to ignore that little issue. Last night I'd done everything in my power to keep her from everyone else and so she'd chosen her only option: me. Now I'd let her go do what (or who) she wanted. Y'know, within limits. I was being generous, not insane.</p>
<p>The first round of play was perfunctory. Half naked went to whole naked before anyone could deal twice. Ashley's Amazing MammariesTM (Patent Pending. All rights reserved) were the first to make their return engagement and, wow, let me tell you, I might have undersold those beauties last time around. They were just so perky and perfect - round and wonderful. You couldn't sculpt a better set.</p>
<p>Then Emma's little titties came out to play and I was rethinking that entire previous paragraph. Yes, she had the smallest boobs of the bunch, but the way they stood so proudly over the great plains of her well-toned tummy, they were living proof that not only does size not matter, it's a uniquely stupid way to judge anything.</p>
<p>But then, of course, I looked over at Kristen's already exposed chest and holy fuck, maybe I was wrong twice. Because Kristen's bountiful bosom, pink and freckled and wondrously wobbly...</p>
<p>I mean, look, I could have spent all day just moving from pair to pair and picking each as the superior. It was an overabundance of riches for me (and Sam, I suppose) to enjoy.</p>
<p>Clothes disposed of, we went right into the next part without even a pause. Ashley kissed Kristen, on the cheek, chastely, and Kristen seemed to almost moan in want for something more. Sam kissed Emma, just a quick peck on the lips, and I found I hardly even minded. Not too much, anyway. I got a wet one from Ashley with some good tongue action. It was nice, actually. Almost friendly. If friends tapped tongues, I mean.</p>
<p>Then Kristen, still hungry from her last amuse bouche, bet kiss. Before I could put my own mouth out there, Sam jumped in and called. He was acting before me and it gave him a huge advantage. Hadn't noticed that.</p>
<p>Sam made a big show of leaning over. He ran his hand through Kristen's amazing hair, then pressed his lips to hers. I watched her whole body rise to the occasion, as if trying to slide herself inside of him, mouth first. He clutched her head close. Ran his hand lightly over her left breast.</p>
<p>Kristen made a little squeak. Her tongue slipped into Sam's mouth. She sighed. Happy.</p>
<p>Sam pulled away.</p>
<p>Kristen stared off into the distance. He'd broken her brain, the bastard. He smiled at her, glanced at me knowingly, then smiled at her again.</p>
<p>"That was... really nice, Sam," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"It was fucking hot," Ashley said.</p>
<p>It was. Dammit. In that moment, I remembered how I'd lost my high school love, Kate, to my best friend Sam. I might have been alright with the ladies, but here I was competing with a master. And, once again, I was about to get schooled.</p>
<p>On the last hand of the round, I somehow ended up owing Emma a kiss. I tried to plant one on her cheek, but she turned suddenly and I found myself lip to lip with my sister. Emma didn't try to snake her tongue, but she pressed her mouth to mine with such intensity, it was sexual all the same. I felt this little spark travel from her lips and right up my spine. My impossibly hard dick found a way to get just that little bit harder.</p>
<p>We separated and she shot me a dirty look. Not an angry glare, oh no, more of a... a stare down that screamed of hatred but also hunger. I could empathize with gazelles, I realized. And I was already in a circle of scavengers.</p>
<p>Then she smiled at me, brightly, and gave her tiny tits a little jiggle.</p>
<p>Round three, still no break from playing. Last night's marathon game was over and now everyone was sprinting for the finish line. Everyone started to take their shots at each other. Nothing below the belt, though. Not yet.</p>
<p>Ashley, to her credit, seemed to accept she had the best chest assets and so shared her riches around. She raised to a breast bobble with her very first hand. Emma smooth called and won the right to a little ruffling. She reached over and clasped Ash's breasts with her dexterous digits.</p>
<p>Ash and Em chorused a little sigh.</p>
<p>"Fuck," Emma said.</p>
<p>"Nice, right?"</p>
<p>"Fucking fantastic."</p>
<p>Ashley managed to look sheepish as she smiled.</p>
<p>"I see what you boys were talking about," Emma said. Then she looked down at her own boobs, almost piteously.</p>
<p>"Don't be like that," Ashley said, "Your tits are fucking fantastic, too. The kind an older brother - or anyone really - would appreciate, I bet. In fact, I believe I will make that very bet on the next hand."</p>
<p>Emma smiled so bright, she could have lit the room.</p>
<p>Instead, however, when Ashley bet boobs, Sam and I up splitting the pot. I got the right and he got the left, a compromise we both were happy to agree to and we both took our time worshipping at the holy alter of Ashley's boobosity. As we split our time on Ashley, Sam and I shared a knowing smile, running our hands roughshod - petting, tweaking, hefting, rubbing - over Ash's amazing breasts. She smiled half-happy, half-put upon. Like a mother cat nursing her kittens.</p>
<p>Emma and Kristen both liked what they saw, clearly, and tried to emulate the same situation of one boy per breast. Sadly, they had more mixed results. It's hard to create a situation where two people share equally, by accident. Even when you make it clear that that's exactly what you're going for. Instead, Sam got to take a ride on Kristen's Matterhorns and I, somehow, again, ended up sitting with my sibling.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>On his turn, Sam brushed Kristen's curtains of hair aside and went straight to it, grasping Kristen's breasts in both hands, squeezing and rolling - a man at a feast with more than he could ever consume. How many pairs of hands had held those tremendous tits? Me, Sam... I mean, maybe Kristen, herself? I mean, I assumed but... honestly that's about it. That was kind of awesome. Like discovering a secret restaurant that you know the whole world will be talking about soon, but for now it's just your own secret splendor.</p>
<p>Kristen smiled and giggled, ticklish, but did her best to hold herself forward. Like trying a really scary rollercoaster she wasn't sure to like, Kristen was good and game, if not exactly excited. I thought she deserved credit for being so brave. Ashley, the expert on these kinds of rides, just half snorted and looked away. She seemed about as impressed with Kristen's innocent act as Kate had been.</p>
<p>For my turn, I was more than a little tentative. Em and I both sat cross-legged facing each other. I couldn't look her in the eyes so I stared down at her chest. Then I couldn't look there either so I ended up examining the pile of the carpet. Nice grey color with little bits of blue and red in there...</p>
<p>Emma took my hands, lightly, and lifted them up to her chest. I noticed the muscles of her arms as he held mine. Not grotesque but still impressive in their tone. They were archetypal, amazing in their own right. Then she placed my hands on her breasts, like resting them on a shelf. Instinctively, I pulled back a little, like I'd touched a hot stove by accident. Emma held them my hands in place till she caught my gaze. We said not a word, but there it was, instant and clear communication. She gave me a smile.</p>
<p>I'm not mad, the smile said.</p>
<p>You should be, I looked back.</p>
<p>Emma pressed my palms into her. Then, sure I would not let go on my own, she slowly let her hands slip away. Who had touched Emma's boobs? No one, that was who. Not even Ashley when she went down on my sister the day before. They were a treasure only once held by one and I did my best to be respectful of that honor.</p>
<p>I lightly played my fingers over Emma's taut, tight breasts. Her nipples, more than prominent, reached out, stretching like a plant for the sun, tasting my palms and begging for more. I squeezed a little, wondering at how something so soft and warm could still be so firm.</p>
<p>Emma smiled at me again.</p>
<p>You're not hurting me, the smile said, you're making me feel good.</p>
<p>I'm glad I'm making you feel good, I smiled back.</p>
<p>The warmth raced throughout my body then, filled with love and desire almost uncontainable. Afraid, suddenly, I pulled away. My hands felt oddly empty. My chest vacant, as well. I started to say something, but then Emma threw a card in my face, pouted, and the game plowed on.</p>
<p>Round one had been all of us gathering at the base of the mountain. Rounds two and three we'd pushed the snowball up the side, gathering steam and snow till we reached the very peak. Now we stood right at the precipice and we knew it, so everyone took a break to look around before we started rolling downhill. Before we were going so fast that nothing could stop us.</p>
<p>Emma got up to pee, but stumbled and fell. Far too much magic for that girl. Ashley and Kristen helped her up and all three girls went to the bathroom together.</p>
<p>"Fucking magic juice," Sam said, then smiled a big toothy grin. What was he playing at? "Fucking. Magic."</p>
<p>We weren't all rubbing on the floor, but people were still clearly, almost painfully aroused and it was creating some interesting obstacles. For instance, for Sam and I to talk, we had to stand with a two-yard neutral zone to prevent any accidental swordplay. In general, though, it made us all a little stupid. Driving towards a single goal somehow also makes you lose your focus.</p>
<p>I found that liquor at least seemed to mellow the effect and so I made sure everyone had a full glass. I wasn't worried about things going crazy, we were already there, I just wanted to keep things from getting insane.</p>
<p>The night before, the cards had been a lubricant. An accelerant. Fuel for the fucking fire. Not today. Now the cards were a deterrent, a reason to not do what we all wanted. We were all racing down the horny highway, but the game kind of pumped the brakes for everyone. Forced us all to take our time before filling each other up. If it wasn't for the cards, we might all have been fucking and sucking - forming a gigantic Voltron fuck robot.</p>
<p>Fuck! Why the fuck were we playing cards!?</p>
<p>Oh right. Because, secretly, we all wanted to wait a little before we reached our destination. Kristen needed time to build up her courage. Emma needed time to get what she wanted, too. Ashley was just enjoying the show, but her fun ended as soon as the game did.</p>
<p>And Sam? Well Sam was up to something. I was too busy staring off in the distance to see what was coming my way.</p>
<p>Break over. My deal. Hand one, Round four. Kristen bet a breast fondle - true to form. Kristen always raised to whatever people had just been doing, which meant she was always a step behind what everyone wanted to do. In baseball terms, we were all rounding second (and headed for third!) while she was still stroking out singles. So Kristen was stuck playing catch up.</p>
<p>"Hand job."</p>
<p>Sam didn't even bother to look up from his card when he said it. Kristen gasped a little, and almost dropped her card. No tell, there, right? It wasn't her turn - I had to act first - but I didn't need to be Dr. Who to see who would be folding soon enough.</p>
<p>"Call," Ashley said. She took a deep drink from her glass. Warming up for one thing or another, I suppose.</p>
<p>Emma played with her card then dropped it. I was... not sure how I felt about that. Relieved and disappointed. Worked up and let down.</p>
<p>I looked down at my own card - so entranced by the action was I, I'd forgotten to make my own decision. I had an 8. Not the worst card in the deck, certainly, but also not playable against these hands. Except...</p>
<p>Well poker, like sex, is a position game. And I was pretty sure I had seen my way to doggy style. OK, that metaphor makes no sense, I know. Just... let's just move on and forget it ever happened.</p>
<p>In any case, I saw an opportunity, maybe one I shouldn't have, honestly. Emma was out. I knew Kristen would fold at first opportunity. That left Sam, Ashley, and me. If I could push Sam out of the hand, well, we'd have something interesting, right? And, because of my position in the hand, I saw my way to doing just that.</p>
<p>I'd told myself at the beginning of the game I wasn't going to do this, I would let Sam have his way with things. But here I was, doing it. I guess in poker terms I was tilting. Sam had been working over my Kristen and suddenly it seemed to me that I ought to go ahead and get mine. I raised.</p>
<p>"Oral."</p>
<p>Like my own personal Rube Goldberg machine, the dominoes fell in perfect order. Kristen pushed her card away like it was poisonous. Sam eyed his card, eyed me, then dumped. Hooray for homophobia! Ashley looked at me coyly from behind her card.</p>
<p>"If we do this... None of that timer bullshit from yesterday, right? You go till I blow."</p>
<p>"Long as you're willing to agree to the same."</p>
<p>"Oh JJ," Ashley said, starting to giggle, "I don't think you need to worry about that."</p>
<p>She showed me her ace. That coy little minx. I can't believe I used to think she was shy. I'd called her a lamp before, skinny and quiet, standing stiffly in the corner of the room. I was so so wrong. Little Ashley was more like one of those big boomboxes from the 80s: loud to the point of obnoxious, often inflammatory, with a nice set of knobs.</p>
<p>Ashley didn't even bother to look at my card. She just stood up, dragged the old oral over and plopped down, legs open and inviting. She drummed her fingers on her thin thighs, impatient.</p>
<p>She set up so quickly, the rest of the room was still sitting in the circle, frozen in shock. I slowly stood and stretched, the pre-sex limbering that's as much foreplay as tongues and fingertips. Then I walked over and knelt down.</p>
<p>Ashley kept her pubes trimmed, but there was still a nice puff of blonde curls above her juicy center. Her thin, pink lips - those nether and otherwise - hung open. She smelled heady and sweet. I let my fingers dance on the her soft, almost creamy inner thighs, readying her for the upcoming action. I didn't really need to bother, that girl was ready to go, but still I knew that the difference between arousing and tickling can often be the patience of a few introductory touches.</p>
<p>Then I drew my tongue out, like unrolling a bit of cellophane, and gave Ashley a long languid lick from stern to bow. She shuddered happily, then put her hand on my forehead, pushing me back.</p>
<p>"Hang on," Ashley said, "I still have two others to attend to." She gestured coolly at Sam and Kristen.</p>
<p>"Wait, what?"</p>
<p>"You bet, right?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>"We folded," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"But you still owe me the bets you made before, don't you? You bet and I called. You don't get to just... take that back, right? We made that rule last night, I'm sure of it."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but..."</p>
<p>"Maybe we were lax about it before," Ashley said, "but I think it's time I collected."</p>
<p>Holy crap on a crapstick. I kept myself focused on my target - I didn't need to stick myself into this any deeper than I was already.</p>
<p>"You," Ashley said, pointing at Sam, "Get down here."</p>
<p>Shit, she didn't want us to like... share did she? Sam gave me a look that showed he was thinking the same thing and similarly scared of that. He inched forward. Ashley waved her finger at him, naughty boy.</p>
<p>"Watch what Jason does. Learn something."</p>
<p>"Hey, I..."</p>
<p>"Please don't even bother. We all saw what happened yesterday. Trust me, I'm doing you a favor. Or whoever your next girlfriend is anyway."</p>
<p>Sam shrugged, cowed, then knelt down sort of behind me and to my left. I doubt he could see much, and I was in no position to narrate.</p>
<p>"You," Ashley said and pointed again.</p>
<p>Kristen held her arms across her chest. She looked ready to run.</p>
<p>"You need to learn, too. Get down here."</p>
<p>"I don't..."</p>
<p>"She only bet a boob feel," Emma said, suddenly standing up for her friend. I was pretty sure she was staying quiet for fear that Ashley might force her into something, next. Would anyone really have argued?</p>
<p>"She's going to get a feel," Ashley said, "of something anyway."</p>
<p>Emma didn't say anything. Kristen slowly bent her legs and shuffled forward. Her big breasts swung as she went along, like palms in a strong ocean breeze.</p>
<p>"Not me. Him."</p>
<p>Ashley pointed at me. Kristen cocked her head, like a puppy in training. About to wet her wee wee pads.</p>
<p>"Same as with Sam over there - sooner or later you're gonna have to learn to do these things like they're not... radioactive. God, you'd think I was the worst person ever, helping you both have a little fun."</p>
<p>Kristen smiled sort of coyly at that. Her cheeks and chest turned a little pink. Then she knelt down on my other side. I sort of swung my right hip open to give her access, hard to do between Ashley's eager legs.</p>
<p>Kristen reached forward and tentatively wrapped her hand around my penis. He throbbed his appreciation. Oh... Oh Ashley. I'm sorry if I ever said anything mean about you. God bless that little golden girl.</p>
<p>Kristen smiled at me, nervous, but not at all upset to be at the ready. Emma was a soccer girl, but Kristen played tennis. I was more than happy to be her racket. Besides, Kristen'd already done a practice round - gotten used to the equipment and all. Betraying her bit of eagerness, I could feel Kristen's hand slowly slide up my shaft, getting in the ready position. Just waiting for Ashley's serve.</p>
<p>Ash signaled for me to get back to work. I dove forward with gusto. As I went down, I caught her glaring at Kristen.</p>
<p>"I go before he goes or no one goes away happy," she warned. Kristen nodded, slowly.</p>
<p>I was lapping at Ashley's oasis within moments. Back to where I'd began, taking long slow licks of her - enough pressure to keep her excited, but too general for anything other than slight stimulation.</p>
<p>Almost like through a fog - my eyes well buried in Ashley's snatch, my ears already muffled by her thighs, and the other senses somehow muted, as well - I felt Kristen gently begin to rub my dick. It felt... distant, like it was happening to another Jason in another place. The echo of deft fingers played about my member, but Kristen was totally tentative now and I was too far into Ashley's own private Narnia to notice much of anything.</p>
<p>I stepped away from my long laps and then slowly moved my lips over Ash's own labia. Almost like kissing her mouth, but, y'know, not a mouth exactly.</p>
<p>"See what he's doing there?" I heard Ashley say to Sam, "Half of what makes oral great? Maybe more than half...ahhhhh. *Sigh* It isn't what you do, but how you do it. Jason licks me like... ohhhh... Jason licks me like he LIKES it. Desires it. Damn near can't live without it."</p>
<p>I gave her hot, dripping opening a little swish. If before was a kiss, this was slipping her my tongue.</p>
<p>"Ahhhhhh," Ashley said, her head lolled back.</p>
<p>I shifted slightly and saw Emma, standing on the far side of Ashley's skinny thigh. Em looked... not unhappy at the moment. Not thrilled either. I imagined it was sort of how I looked when she kissed Sam the day before. It was hot, surely, but not in a way that either of us had wanted it to be. I returned to my ministrations, then started to slide my tongue up toward Ash's clit before deftly dancing away. A little feint.</p>
<p>I got a nice long groan out of her as my reward. Not content. Frustrated. But happy to be so.</p>
<p>"Ahhhhhhhuuuuugggghhhhh."</p>
<p>We'd been together enough by now (two whole days!) that I knew Ashley was a quiet cummer. She might grunt and squeak a little at the beginning, but when it came time for the crescendo, she would go stiff - still and silent. As Ashley talked, as she voiced her approval, he was also telling me we were far from her grand finale.</p>
<p>"See..." Ashley said, her hands hanging limply at her sides, "Sam... See... what Jason's doing here is... See..."</p>
<p>As I slowly dragged my tongue down, I felt Kristen's hand on my cock go ever more confident. She'd sort of held it there for a bit, I guess giving me a head start. Now that Ashley had dropped back to mere mutterings, now that her body was slowly coiling up - like a cat ready to pounce - Kristen figured that it was safe to start pulling for her own payout. And so she did.</p>
<p>If eagerness made for great oral, then it wasn't half-bad for hand jobs either. Kristen, bless her, was stroking me now with an enthusiasm that can only come from the inexperienced. Inexpert, yet ecstatic. I didn't even need to look at Kristen's face to know she was smiling. The way her hand just slid up and down my shaft - probably a little too hard but it hardly mattered at that point - told me everything I needed to know. Kristen had enjoyed her little treat earlier. Now she was gonna be a good girl and earn another.</p>
<p>"Ohhhh, a very good girrrrrl," I moaned into Ashley mons, more to myself then anything. I curled my tongue, then slid it into Ashley's open hole. The source was ever sweeter and I pushed forward with abandon, my whole body slowly sliding up towards Ashley's hot little hole. Crammed into that small, slowly crushing space. Kristen dutifully shifted along with me, grip still tight. We were all hanging on a rope, climbing over the cliffside, attached by the thin bit of muscle in my mouth called my tongue.</p>
<p>Ashley's legs went stiff as my shaft. She curled up, just impossibly tight. Started to shake. To throb. Then suddenly.</p>
<p>"Oral!" she cried.</p>
<p>The whole room stopped in mid-stroke. I let my tongue slide out of his new, happy home. I looked up. Kristen was holding up my cock like she'd just found it on the floor and was looking for who might've lost one. Emma's hand shot up in a way that made it completely clear where she'd been stuffing it. Sam just sat there, wearing his signature smile, somewhere between confused and bemused.</p>
<p>"Enough of that," Ashley said. I flinched back. Really?</p>
<p>"Oh, not you baby," Ashley said, rubbing her fingers through my hair ever so lovingly, "You're doing just fine. More than fine, I mean... You're earning yourself a lifetime free pass, you know? Not even Kat... I mean, I don't give a lot of those out, OK? Seriously."</p>
<p>I looked up into her eyes, deep and almost golden brown like warm bread out of the oven. She could have told me to go lick the floors and I'd have thought about it, so sincere seemed her praise and affection.</p>
<p>"No, I had someone else in mind," Ashley continued, then looked over at Kristen, "Time to put his penis where your mouth is, honey."</p>
<p>I swear, if my goods had been a live grenade, Kristen couldn't have dropped them any faster. My cock hung cold, dejected.</p>
<p>"What?" Kristen asked. She looking legitimately upset - the previous flush of arousal practically fled from her face. Her nipples shrank back to nothing. I just sat there, silent. I may be an idiot, but I'm an idiot who knows when it would be supremely stupid to speak.</p>
<p>"She folded on oral. Remember?" Emma said, again coming to her besty's defense. Then Em started running through the hand. "She bet a boob feel, which we've already gone FAR beyond, being honest. Then Sam raised it to a handy and..."</p>
<p>"I know what she bet," Ashley said, "I'm just saying... If this is going to be a learning exercise, y'know, why not do two for one? I mean, Krissy here clearly figured out how to use the jack, let's see if she can't ummm... I dunno, change the whole tire? I'm way too worked up for a good metaphor right now."</p>
<p>I knew the feeling.</p>
<p>Ashley cocked an eyebrow at me, as if daring me to deny my own blowjob. Right. No one turns down a free trip to Disney World, I don't care what you make them do in return.</p>
<p>"There are worse cocks to have in your mouth the first time," Ashley said, "And JJ will warn you before he goes, right JJ?"</p>
<p>I nodded in earnest, like I might actually make that happen. Even if I did tell Kristen I was about to deliver the meal portion of our little lunch and learn, my warning would almost certainly be muffled by Ashley's wonderful little muff.</p>
<p>I waited for Sam to step in and demand that he was just as competent a recipient for blowjob lessons as I was (and less alternatively engaged, as well), but he said nothing. I guess he figured he was getting off (ha ha) easy with just a look-see.</p>
<p>I waited for Em to get in the way again, but instead she kind of just shrugged at her bestie as if to say, well, Ashley's right about Jason's penis being pretty awesome and all so yeah, you should totally go for it. I remember thinking, at that moment, that Em's own acceptance meant she had some kind of side deal with Ashley. Then I got distracted by all the goings on. But, well... You'll see.</p>
<p>Finally, then, I waited for Kristen to say something. I couldn't really see her, buried as I was with Ashley's treasure. I felt Kristen's hand grip my cock again - no hesitation there. My little fellow was far from reluctant, too, let me tell you. Kristen then lifted him up slightly, almost defiant. This is mine, her grip said, don't even dare to take him from me.</p>
<p>And then I felt something wet and warm engulf the head of my cock. Holy holy holy. Fucking fucking fucking.</p>
<p>"Jason?"</p>
<p>I was too far gone. I felt Kristen's taste buds slowly dance over every nerve ending in my penis. Kristen wasn't just putting it in there, man, she was fucking tasting it. Hungrily devouring a delicious, rare delicacy.</p>
<p>Her right hand held my member steady, her long blonde hair tickled at my exposed skin. Kristen's thick, pink lips applied tight suction on the mid-section of my shaft and her tongue fucking rubbed over my oh-so-sensitive head. This was someone who had no idea what she was doing? Who fucking cares when she does it like this?</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"Jason."</p>
<p>Ashley again.</p>
<p>"Jason!"</p>
<p>"Huh... wha?"</p>
<p>"You go till I blow," Ashley said, tasting each word before she sent it out. She smiled. I leaned my head forward but the polarity had reversed. All my brain action was down at my penis, slowly roasting around in Kristen's moist mouth. My tongue and teeth were practically numb. My mind could hardly process even simple ideas. Unfrozen cavemen oral. Jason lean forward. Jason lick pussy. Jason... What was Jason doing again?</p>
<p>"Hey K?" Ashley said, "Remember what we said. I get my treat first, honey."</p>
<p>"Mmmhmmm" Kristen said around my meat. Holy fuck that was the sexiest reply ever.</p>
<p>I did my best to bring some consciousness back to my brain and leaned forward. Ashley's legs wrapped my head oh-so-tightly. Her little engine hadn't gone too cold from the unscheduled stop, but I still spent some time warming her up before I hit the gas again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kristen figured out that she could stroke me off using BOTH her mouth on the top and her hand at the root while also dragging her absolutely amazing, silky hair back and forth along my cock and... holy fuck. I had to hurry if I was gonna keep Kristen's promise to Ash about who fired first.</p>
<p>I folded my tongue again and drove it into Ashley's open, drooling into her ignition slot. She purred and growled. I felt her legs snap taut, even more than earlier. Then I slowly slid my rolled up stimulator right up to her button and floored it.</p>
<p>"Oh, FUCK!"</p>
<p>Ashley practically pulled her legs up over her head, then popped stock straight. Legs out. Arms to her side. Pinned to the chair like she'd been nailed there. I worked left and right, up and back, then pressed deep for all I was worth.</p>
<p>Ashley started to shake. Shiver. A little trailing groan escaped her lips, like the air hissing out of a tire. A long little "ahhhhhhhhhhuuuuuuuggggghhhhh" that I was pretty sure only my nearby ears could pick up.</p>
<p>Ashley shook and shook, one long continuous tremor. The groan petered out to a squeak.</p>
<p>And then, at that very moment, Kristen sucked my whole cock into her mouth like pulling cement through a straw. It was amazing. Fantastic. The kind of suction they advertise for vacuum cleaners. Y'know, the kind that you don't actually ever get when the damn thing comes home.</p>
<p>With that one motion, I went from zero to sixty. I was well on my way to cumming already - this sudden suction threw me well past the edge before I even realized it was gone. One minute fine then suddenly... my cock was just streaming cum into Kristen's amazing mouth, pleasure just bursting from every extremity. My hair fucking came in that moment.</p>
<p>I tried to throw my head back - warn Kristen what was cumming - but Ashley held my lips tight to her own. Instead I made a little "Uuumph," right into Ashley's pussy. I heard a soft little "uuumph," a mirror of my own, come right out of Kristen as my seed went straight down her throat. I waited to feel the desensitizing cold air, hear the heavy coughs of a girl caught unawares. That last little disappointing end of my cum that would absolutely ruin whatever pleasure had come before it.</p>
<p>Instead Kirsten's suction only seemed to increase with the first delivery of my molten ecstasy. Her tongue shot forward, ensuring instant delivery of my essence.</p>
<p>Slurp. Slurp. Slurp.</p>
<p>Ashley's legs loosened as her epic orgasm subsided. I somehow found myself still in the throes. I looked back and saw Kristen hadn't just held me in her hand, her mouth, but it seemed her whole body was curled around my cock, suckling at my semen. A curtain of amazing long yellow hair hung over it all like a shroud, protecting our intimacy.</p>
<p>I expected to see shock, anger, fear in her face, but instead Kristen looked positively frantic, working her lips over my head and pumping my cock, trying to bring as much of my fertile feed to her mouth as she could.</p>
<p>Slurp. Slurp. Slurp.</p>
<p>The virgin goddess was fucking draining me, her giant tits wobbled along as she pulled my come into her - begging my penis for more than it could possibly produce. The endorphin pleasure of it all - what had been so absolutely earth shattering at first- was almost an afterthought now, compared to the satisfaction of Krissy's amazing, masterful suck.</p>
<p>"Fuck, yeah," Ashley moaned, "See that is how it's fucking DONE."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but agree. My cock made a few final spasms in Kristen's mouth, timed to Ashley's own little orgasmic aftershocks. I did my best to sort of comfort Ashley's opening with my tongue, keeping it warm and happy but careful not to stimulate the contented little clitoris.</p>
<p>Kristen, almost instinctively, did the same thing. Even as my member slowly softened, spitting out its last little dribbles of sperm, Kristen held him in her mouth, cosseted and cozy. Letting the last of my orgasm sort of drift happily down the river of my body.</p>
<p>Finally, she let him slide out. Then Kristen stood, arms raised triumphantly. She spun around, her golden tresses dancing in the light like a long, luxuriant halo. Once she was sure everyone's attention was her own, Kristen dramatically, demonstratively, closed her eyes, threw her head back, and swallowed my seed with a long loud gulp followed by a gasp of ultimate satisfaction. Then the somehow still-innocent blonde licked her lips, slow and languid, like searching for every last drop. Her pink tongue amazing against the little white leavings of my own ejaculate.</p>
<p>I almost came all over again.</p>
<p>"Fuck, girl, that was... OK, now I'm REALLY not buying the whole innocent act," Ashley said, still curled up on the cum chair like a sleepy kitty.</p>
<p>Kristen just smiled, the cat that ate my canary.</p>
<p>To say it took a while for us to recover would be... OK, it would be complete and utter bullshit. Thanks to our little show, Sam and Emma were practically running up and down the length of the ship to cool off. Kristen was only emboldened by her escapade. Ashley, well, we'd already learned that one big O was barely enough for that girl. And me? Thanks to the wonders of magic juice, I was hard as fuck all over again before I saw another card.</p>
<p>Fucking magic.</p>
<p>I thought I'd at least be flagging a bit, but no. I'd had marathon sessions before with girlfriends. While I might have been able to go three or four rounds on a good night (and this was beyond a good night), after turn two my little man would at least feel a little punch drunk. Now, I'd already had an epic explosion the night before along with two more masterful performances that day. But as far as my member was concerned, he hadn't even jumped in the pool yet, let alone swam himself silly.</p>
<p>At least, I thought, my balls should feel pretty empty, but it seemed that some sort of emergency re-supply service had kicked in. Rather than feeling like ping pongs my baby-batter mixers hung heavier than medicine balls. This was either the best thing ever or the worst and, I'll be honest, I was too high to worry about it at the moment.</p>
<p>I got a break to pee. Kristen took a full glassful of whatever-the-heck it was we were drinking by then and then poured herself a refill. Ashley just sat on her perch and watched the world roll by.</p>
<p>And then we were all holding cards again. Sam looked particularly peeved and, stupidly, I enjoyed it. He thought he could have my girls, but it was Kristen tasting my cock on her fingers and Ashley feeling my saliva drip down her snatch.</p>
<p>I thought I'd won. Instead I'd only accelerated my own upcoming losses.</p>
<p>Two things happened then that completely threw me off the scent of what Sam was up to. One was a mistake on his end, the other was intentional. I just didn't see it at the time because, like I said before, I'm an idiot. And I was high. And probably drunk, too.</p>
<p>Looking back, I could see the trap Sam had set up to get revenge on me for giving it to his girlfriend. At the time, I thought he was struggling, scrambling. I didn't see the webbing out until I was well and truly trapped.</p>
<p>But first, we had another round of hands that, although they certainly weren't boring, were nothing to write Penthouse about.</p>
<p>Kristen dealt. She was raring to go for something fun but she miscalculated when she shouted out oral. For one, she might have wanted to suck some dick but I'd already folded when she made the offer. Sam, despite his little 'lesson,' wasn't going to risk going down on a girl after last night's debacle and today's public shaming. Certainly not on a virgin who probably still couldn't even get herself off. As for the girls, well, it was well known that Kristen had no intention of going down that primrose path - without even realizing it, she'd turned down a dead end. Fold fold foldity fold.</p>
<p>On the next hand I once again, somehow, found myself indebted to Emma, but only a kiss this time. No little cheek trick this time. I sat across from her again and Emma practically tackled me, like a move from her girl's rugby days.</p>
<p>She leapt forward, breaking down the barrier of my lips and teeth with her tongue, and suddenly we tipped backward to the floor. I tried to grunt, to shout, say anything, but it was blocked by one amazing, confident, and totally in control girl. Her arms reached out, grabbed my hands and put them above my head. Her little titties smushed into my chest, short sharp mounds, grinding down.</p>
<p>She pressed my head back, tongue tangled with my own, and as she did her body pressed down, too. My cock was suddenly grinding hard against... something. I couldn't really see and, being honest, pressure is pressure. I could have been trapped between our stomachs of even up against a muscular Emma-thigh. But somehow - the way she was rubbing, the little tickle of what remained of her dark, wiry hair - I would swear that I was buried in her warm, juicy cleft.</p>
<p>She sort of ground her body back and forth, up and back. Sort of riding me like she was holding onto a creaky sled going down a fast, super-steep hill.</p>
<p>Emma kissed and barely broke for air, pressed down again. Gasped and nuzzled. Kind of giggled in her throat. Ground hard down on my cock and didn't bother to hide it. She slid forward. Wherever my penis had been, he was sure he was at her entrance now - the wet opening orifice just seemed to ache to pull him in.</p>
<p>Then, almost with the same sudden violence, Emma popped up, leaving me lying there, cold and abused. I swore I could see stars orbiting her coffee-brown hair, like a stunned cartoon character. She smiled at me, both shy at what she'd done and proud of how she did it - look what I can do for you big brrruuuuther. Haven't I been good enough to get more?</p>
<p>Lord forgive me, I smiled back. If little Jason had been anywhere near sleepy time, he was fully up and ready to go now.</p>
<p>"You taste good on him," Emma told Ashley. Ashley smiled back, a retort clearly on her tongue, but she held it up. Maybe Ashley was hoping to get a little taste of her own later and didn't want to spoil anything.</p>
<p>The next hand, Ashley somehow tricked a kiss out of Kristen, who did a good job of pretending she didn't enjoy it a little.</p>
<p>"Tastes like Jason sperm," Ashley announced to the group, continuing our new tradition of post-kiss reports. Sam stuck out his tongue, to say 'gross,' but the other girls just smiled, dreamily.</p>
<p>"Pretty damn good," Ashley added.</p>
<p>"I could see it as a Ben and Jerry's flavor," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna go grab some from the store right now," Emma agreed, "Jason's Jellied Jism."</p>
<p>Sam, not at all happy about this turn of talk, pressed hard on the next deal but got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. In Ashley and Emma's cookie jars, to be specific.</p>
<p>Sam bet hand job like no one would dare doubt it, but Ashley and Emma both called with Queens (I know, so apropos. The universe has a strange sense of humor sometimes). Sam had been playing for a jack and got two jills. Not the worst result in the world and he made a good show of excitement once he got over the initial disappointment.</p>
<p>At Ashley's suggestion, the girls dragged the other chairs over from the kitchen and then sat on either side of Sam. Ashley, lucky girl, got the strong hand.</p>
<p>"Go until you blow?" Sam asked, taunting.</p>
<p>"Eh, we'll see how it goes," Ashley said, looking at Emma. My little sister nodded back, knowingly. Nervously.</p>
<p>I didn't watch what Sam was doing. I didn't pay attention to his technique, the movement of his fingers, whether he traced and teased or just went right in for the rub. I didn't look at Ashley, either. I don't know if she was enjoying herself or just along for the ride. If she came, I don't know. If she went, I didn't go.</p>
<p>I watched Emma. My Emma, only. Little, amazing Em, leaned back on that same kitchen chair she'd sat on for family dinners, only naked now, with her legs obscenely open and inviting. I had a momentary thought, seeing her doing that same pose while my mother served some fish that Dad had caught and the whole family just draaawwwwwn in to Em's incredible center. Yeah, Dad, like you could resist hitting that.</p>
<p>I looked at Em's face, her liquid green eyes. Her cheeks flushed pink, sweat dribbling down her forehead. There was a lovely little squish, squish, squish noise that I knew came from my over-lubricated little sister.</p>
<p>Mouth open. Eyes slammed shut. Breathing like a runner, yet barely even moving. Emma's beautiful, elfin face contorted, that strange cringe of extreme pleasure that looks so much like pain.</p>
<p>Em's chest - wet with sweat, frantic with need - rose and fell. Her ponytail swished slightly back and forth. Her hands gripped the armrests like squeezing for safety. Emma's erect nipples were so pointy they made an exclamation mark on the top of her tits. Her perfectly shaped breasts tried so hard to shake along with her body. Those amazing, perky promontories were too small to stagger about like Kristen's or Kate's. Instead they merely trembled. Tremored. Then my little sister's beautiful, innocent face widened in a silent scream. Her whole body bright pink. A little gasp and then a contented sigh.</p>
<p>"There it is." She almost whispered it.</p>
<p>Emma held up her hand. No mas. Sam smiled with satisfaction. Emma smiled wanly back. She didn't look satiated so much as tired. Strangely, it made me think about how I'd felt after Ashley's aborted dry hump the day before. A kind of satisfaction, certainly, but also somehow, hungrier and even further unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Ashley looked similarly exhausted, so Sam was clearly a solid multitasker. I hardly cared. I'd seen my baby sister cum twice now at the ministrations of others. An intimate thing siblings are never supposed to share. I mean, you walk in on someone in the bathroom or the towel slips and you see a bit of boob. That stuff happens to pretty much every family. You live in a small house, you're gonna see some body parts - even the ones you don't want to see.</p>
<p>But my sister's body flexed in full out flying cum... I mean, there aren't twenty sibs in the whole world, maybe, who've seen that on accident. Let alone twice. I felt privy to something unique and special. Wonderful and rare. My baby little Emma, body reaching desperately for release. My driving want for her - to be the one she begged to - it overwhelmed whatever else I felt.</p>
<p>In my deepest darkest heart, it wasn't just that I wanted to make my little sister cum. I truly believed that I could bring her somewhere so much further. Unreachable by any other. And I knew - even if I could never admit it, let alone allow it - that I'd give anything to take her there.</p>
<p>Round 4 had started off so well with our oral carousel, but then pretty much petered out. As a punishment for our prudish natures, we went straight into Round 5. I refilled glasses with one hand and dealt with the other.</p>
<p>First deal was mine, but it wasn't to be. Emma won a kiss from Kristen who, if she wasn't exactly coming over to the side of girl + girl = awesome, was at least willing to test the proof, herself.</p>
<p>"Your Jason flavor is fading," Emma told her best friend after they'd almost perfunctorily played with each other's tongues. "You need to go get a refill."</p>
<p>Kristen gave me the puppy-dog eyes as she sat down. Yeah, cause I was totally against serving her seconds. Right.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Sam had stopped kissing Kristen once she had my special sauce on her lips, but he started a whole new streak and the next two hands.</p>
<p>First he won himself another Kristen-breast rub which wasn't all that interesting and so easy enough for me to ignore. Then the very next deal, Sam absolutely, intentionally lost his hand to win a stroke session for Kristen. They set up with the kitchen chairs again - apparently it's easier to reach into a girl when perched above her. Sam and Kristen sat side by side and he gave the gorgeous girl a little kiss on the cheek before flexing his fingers and getting down to it.</p>
<p>I cleaned up old bottles and filled fresh glasses while Sam went to work. I didn't have nearly enough time to clean up. For all Sam's skill in taking Emma and Ashley to the promised land (and both at once, at that), he was barely able to get our eager little ingenue a little down the road.</p>
<p>I won't say I didn't find it a little gratifying, having gotten Kristen off once, myself. But it wasn't for lack of effort and, honestly, I'm not sure I'd have been able to do it, either. That girl needed to figure out her own directions before inviting the boys over to find their own way.</p>
<p>I thought that failure might slow Sam down, but instead, he kept driving on. The next deal, he and Kristen were heading straight past Hand Job City and right into Oralville. Oralville would be the next, though certainly not the last, stop on this train.</p>
<p>Only something suddenly turned and it Sam's plan went right off the tracks. I don't know if Sam misread the hands or the betting or what. But when the dirty, sexy poker train hissed to a stop, Kristen found Emma standing at the platform, not Sam. If Kristen's eyes could have popped right out and rolled into the ocean, they would have.</p>
<p>Kristen gasped. Floundered. She stood up. Sat back down again. Emma just stayed still, like she was lost in thought. Meanwhile, Sam looked on in aroused horror as he realized he had somehow blown a blowjob from my slutty little sister and won... well maybe one of the greatest shows ever to be performed?</p>
<p>"Can't I just... I mean..." Kristen fumbled.</p>
<p>"Well, if I'd known this was gonna happen, I'd have given you a far different sort of training," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"Shut up."</p>
<p>I heard seagulls crying in the distance, a strange taunting sort of sound. The low and lulling hum of water as it slowly rolled under the ship. With every little bump, the ice from our drinks clinked against the glass. A little happy bell.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful, gorgeous, once in a lifetime day outside and we'd locked ourselves below without light or air. It was the best decision we'd ever made.</p>
<p>"It's... Come on Krissy. It's not so bad," Emma said. She'd found a way to take this personally, like Kristen was rejecting her and not, y'know, every woman ever. Emma was standing, arms resting under her fantastic tiny titties. Her hips - built for two things, running and pushing out babies - were cocked slightly to the side. Her hair was still up in a ponytail. Amazing, athletic little Emma. She wet her lips.</p>
<p>"Yeah but... I mean..."</p>
<p>"You love your friend don't you?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>"Don't start that shit again," I said.</p>
<p>"That's just it, right?" Kristen continued, "That's my best friend in the whole world and I don't want to do anything to..."</p>
<p>"You don't have to do anything," Sam said, "Remember, it's her doing it to you."</p>
<p>"Come on, Krissy," Emma said, suddenly smiling widely, "I think it'll be fun."</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>Well, I mean, come on. How does anyone say no to that?</p>
<p>We unrolled the Kate cum blanket, forever named in her honor. Thousands of years from now, when it's bronzed, whole families will drive for hours upon hours to see the famous Kate cum blanket. Yes, kids, that's where it all happened. That's where everything began.</p>
<p>Kristen lay down, like a patient on an iron cold table. Arms straight stiff and eyes closed. She spread her legs just slightly. Emma. My Emma. Really, honestly, Kristen's Emma - her best friend forever before, now, and into the future - crawled up Kristen's body. Then Emma rested her head on her bestie's chesty, right above the golden goddess' voluminous, incredible boobs.</p>
<p>Emma whispered something and Kristen smiled. A big smile, bright and wonderful. Then Emma slid up a little further, and brushed her lips over her expectant lover's. As Emma slid back down - she had a ways to go, Emma was five foot barely while Kristen was almost as tall as me - Kristen tilted her head back, closed her eyes, and sighed. Sort of accepting, I suppose.</p>
<p>I looked at Ashley, but she just shrugged. I didn't dare look at Sam.</p>
<p>"You want any pointers, kiddo?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>"No, I... Actually I think it'll be more fun if I feel my way through," Emma replied, her voice kind of dreamy and distant.</p>
<p>"That's my girl!" Ashley winked at me.</p>
<p>Remember what Ashley said before about enthusiasm? Yeah, Emma had that going for her. All the way.</p>
<p>"Watch," Ashley commanded Sam.</p>
<p>"Seriously?" Sam said, "Can you just... let it go?"</p>
<p>In response, Ashley reached over and flicked Sam's dangling dong.</p>
<p>"You want to ride the merry-go-round, you gotta buy the ticket," she said. I tried to think through what she was trying to say, then thought better of it. We were far too high for clever - just about the right height for fucking.</p>
<p>Emma crawled into position. We didn't have to look to see when she started. Kristen announced it with a long, drawn out,</p>
<p>"Oooooohhhhhhh"</p>
<p>We'd learned a lot about each other in the last two days. Maybe too much. Little secrets we'd thought would never come out were suddenly on display for everyone to see. My massive crush on my little sister. The cracks in Sam and Kate's relationship. Ashley, the so-not-shy little sexpot. And quiet, conservative Kristen? Turned out she was a talker.</p>
<p>"Higher... ooooooh slower... ohhhhh that's it. Oh, Emma lick me there, lick me good... No lower now, that's it... stick your tongue right... AH! Ohhhhhh! That's it... that's my girl...</p>
<p>Oh Emma... Em... Little Emmy... You... That feels sooooo nniiiiiiiice."</p>
<p>Another thing we found out: Emma gives oral on all fours. Head down. Bottom up. Beautiful, tight little quim, almost bare of hair, just up in the air and begging for someone to plug in and complete the circuit.</p>
<p>Ashley looked at me, pointedly, then pointed. Go for it! She mouthed. I shook my head back and forth vehemently. Ashley's face turned... well, ashen. Then angry. It started with a death glare and ended with her outright refusal to even look my way.</p>
<p>"You're gonna get it Jason," she said through clenched teeth, "Or you're gonna lose it. I just hope you can find a way to rationalize what you've done after you realize you got the wrong end."</p>
<p>I focused on what was happening in front of me.</p>
<p>"Oh, Em... All those times... Together. At your house. At mine." Kristen was rambling on, head rolling back and forth. Stupendous breasts spinning in time. Her legs were raised now, knees pointed and forward, mirroring her fantastic, pointing pink nipples.</p>
<p>"All those times in our fuzzy pjs... Lying in bed, watching TV. Just... OH... Just think. We could have been...OH fffffuuck! We could have been doing thhiiiiiisssssss."</p>
<p>Emma laughed a little from her spot down at Kristen's twat. Then she redoubled her efforts.</p>
<p>"Like... like this baby?" Emma asked, a little muffled.</p>
<p>Kristen shook in response, like shivering, naked on a freezing day. She started shouting.</p>
<p>"Oh Em! My little... My little bestie. Remember when...OH... remember when we would lie there in the dark, just you and me on the bed... Talk about your... your biiiiiiig brother... Just there in the next room... We used to wonder what he was... Ah. AH fuck! Would've been so much better if we'd just gone over and found... OH... Think about it."</p>
<p>"Uh huh." Emma from below.</p>
<p>"Just... just picture it."</p>
<p>"Uh huh."</p>
<p>"Sneaking out of your room, oh so quiet. The floorboards creaking under our feet. We creep next door to your... ffffUCK that's good... to JJ's room... Light's shining out from under the door."</p>
<p>Ashley gave me a look, but I just stared at my little sis as she went down on beautiful, suddenly so sexy, Kristen. Watched as Krissy's astounding silky, gold hair swished back and forth over her body - covering her breasts, her stomach, even tangled a bit with Emma's own hair. Yeah, I'd crushed on Kristen. Lots of times. She was my sister's best friend and oh, so beautiful. And because of that - the friendship, the age difference - did she have a little of the forbidden sister bit rub off on her, as well. You better believe it did. Same guilt, same driving desire. If you could get a girl pregnant just by thinking about her when you... Man, both those girls working each other up on the floor would've already had hundreds of my kids</p>
<p>"Your biiiiiiig bruther..." Kristen was just babbling now, the only thing stuttering and shaking more than her mouth was her unbelievable body. "Ohhhhhhh. And... We open the door and... there he is. Little JJ. Jason. Our little Jay Bird. Only not... not so little after all. Right?" And... and we cover him in kisses. Slowly pull off all his clothes and rub up and down his body. Take that... shove that big thing inside and bust our cherries. So good. So...</p>
<p>"Emma?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Little Emmy?"</p>
<p>"I'm here, baby. I'm here bestie. Just... just getting you there, OK? Let me get you there."</p>
<p>"Em is that your brother's cock in your hand? Are... are you sticking it inside me? Oh... Oh Emmy you... you can't stuff me full of your big brother's immense, enormous cock... I'm not... I'm not on... Oh but it... it feels so good that big... big bruuuuther cock it...</p>
<p>"I know, baby. I know. It'sssss so good," Emma said. Gasping like she was getting licked alongside her friend.</p>
<p>"It's... it's going in you next right? You're gonna let me stuff you full of your brother's cock. Give him your precious, juicy, virgin hole. Feel him... fill you up like he's filling... meeheeeheeeee. Let him give you his... OH! Oh baby! Oh Emmmmmy, little Emmy that feels so... Keep... Keep licking me. Just like that. OH! Don't stop. Don't... EVER stop licking ME!"</p>
<p>Emma drove her head down between her bestie's legs. Her ponytail whipped back and forth, so hard I swear Kristen's thighs turned pink from the thrashing. Then Kristen threw her head back and howled, teeth bared and gnashing.</p>
<p>"Huuuuurrrrrrrr!"</p>
<p>Thighs snapped tight. Neck straining. Kristen's whole body bucked once, twice, like Emma's tongue was electrified.</p>
<p>"Ohhhhh oh FUCK! GOD! Oh my..." Kristen was almost sobbing as she shook, "Oh my fucking fucking god..."</p>
<p>Emma picked her head up from where she'd been operating and smiled slightly, letting her pride leak out over the room. Her face was sticky with girl stuff, her chest almost cherry red. Emma looked at me and then laughed a little. Brushed the little bit of brown hair out of her eyes.</p>
<p>Kristen, on the other hand, seemed almost comatose. She just lay back, arms stock straight again, thighs bent on angle, breasts almost sitting on her side. Like someone had completely uncoiled her. Which, I suppose, Emma just had.</p>
<p>"Well," Kristen said to the ceiling, "I guess I'm gay now. Thanks for that. My parents are gonna be thrilled, let me tell you."</p>
<p>Emma turned back from us and climbed up her best friend, careful to drag her terrific tiny titties across Kristen's body - even bumping them a little on Kristen's much larger mounds. Then she leaned over her friend's face and kissed her softly on the lips, lovingly. She whispered something, again, and Kristen just smiled back beatifically.</p>
<p>"OK?" Emma asked. Kristen nodded, Emphatic.</p>
<p>"You're sure? Really?"</p>
<p>"You better bet I am," Emma said.</p>
<p>"God... God I love you little Emmy."</p>
<p>"Damn straight," Emma said back, softly.</p>
<p>The next hand - the last of Round five - was a weird, all fold around. This happens pretty much all the time in actual poker, but was positively bizarre in the dirty, sexy version we'd invented. No one wanted to pause for the end of the round, so I dealt the first hand of Round sex, er, six.</p>
<p>I wiped the sweat from my brow. It was hot as balls down there. If we weren't already naked we'd have been stripping down, anyway. I'd have moved the game outside, but there were far too many other boats nearby for our particular party.</p>
<p>Both Emma and Kristen were still stumbly from their last go round. I knew they'd fold before they even examined their cards. Sam, strangely, also folded, looking right at Ashley. But Ashley wasn't looking at Sam, she was staring me down. She looked at her card, like looking at the ingredients on a cake mix box and said,</p>
<p>"I believe that I will be betting... a dry hump."</p>
<p>Hey hey! And here I thought she was mad at me. Sometimes reruns really are the best thing on TV. Plus, I might see the extra-special director's cut ending if I, literally, played my cards right.</p>
<p>So when I looked down at my card for the first time (I'd been a bit distracted doing the dealing and the end-of-round drink refresh), I was thinking I'd just insta-call and be done with it. But then I saw what I was holding and my whole strategy changed</p>
<p>I had a king. And Ashley, bless her, had bet a dry hump.</p>
<p>Hmmmm.</p>
<p>Now here's the thing. I could just call and one of us would lie down and the other would do some dragging. Based on how the day had been going, the group wouldn't even set the timer this time. Ashley would let things get hot and heavy again and... Or maybe not. Dry hump, by definition, meant nothing was getting wet and, really, where was the fun in that? I wanted something a little more open ended.</p>
<p>Fuck it was hot. I felt so dirty from all we'd been doing. Made it hard to think.</p>
<p>What could I raise to? Betting fuck felt crass and, honestly, a little too much like pushing my luck. Believe it or not, anal sex didn't really appeal to me. What about a boob job? She did have the most Amazing MammariesTM (Patent Pending. All rights reserved). But you know, boob jobs are kind of the Monet of fucking. They look great from a distance but in reality...eh. Sex needs lubrication. Boobs don't lube. Sweat is not nearly as slippery as needed.</p>
<p>We sure had a lot of sweat though, I was practically broiling in it.</p>
<p>And there it was.</p>
<p>"I raise," I announced. The whole group looked at me, somewhere between surprise and disdain. I was the kid at Toys R Us whose parents had already picked out a new toy. Only now I was daring to demand even more. Hey you little fucker, maybe we just get you nothing. How's that?</p>
<p>The group leaned in. Ashley seemed... Happy? Upset? I couldn't read her anymore.</p>
<p>"Shower," I said.</p>
<p>I heard Emma suck her breath in on my left. Sam tsked his tongue.</p>
<p>"That..." Ashley began, "That is actually a really good bet. Nice job, dude."</p>
<p>"What?" Kristen asked, "What's the big deal about a shower?"</p>
<p>"Good lord," Ashley said, "You are the most prudish little slut I've ever..."</p>
<p>"Whatever. You guys make everything dirty," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"You get in there. Get all soapy and slippery..." Sam said. He seemed to be picturing shower sex more than he was defining it. His mental image seemed to make him both happy and appalled.</p>
<p>"It's a good bet," Emma said "It really really is. Bastard."</p>
<p>"When this becomes a professional sport, you're gonna be the Tiger Woods," Ashley told me.</p>
<p>"I'll wear number 69?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Not yet, you won't."</p>
<p>"So you're calling my bet, then?"</p>
<p>Ashley looked back at her card. The whole room seemed to hold its breath. Emma and Kristen were excited by proxy, only, but why was Sam so... engaged in all this? He looked like he was standing on the side of the craps table with all his chips resting on the next throw of the dice. Only he didn't have any chips on the table. I couldn't imagine what he cared about here.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Ashley said, "Yeah. I call."</p>
<p>She showed her jack. I showed my king. It hardly mattered.</p>
<p>"It's so hot down here," Kristen said, "I'm jealous. I could use a shower, too."</p>
<p>"Then stay in the hand next time, Sister Christiana," Ashley said. She stood up, took my hand, and led me to the back of the boat. I grabbed a couple of towels on the way.</p>
<p>"I'm...I'm gonna try to go cool off a little," Emma said. She started walking up towards the deck. I imagined it had more to do with the chance of hearing Ashley and me over the rushing water. It was odd, really, Emma had no problem letting me give it to Kate the night before. In fact, she'd encouraged it. When I was with Kristen, hell, Emma seemed to almost enjoy it as much as we did. But when I was with Ashley, Emma suddenly seemed as uncomfortable as me when I watched her fool around with, well... anyone.</p>
<p>"You guys have twenty minutes!" Kristen called after us "I'm setting the timer!"</p>
<p>"I got it!"</p>
<p>I had no doubt that Ash and I could do all kinds of great stuff in twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Once the water was warm enough, we stepped in. The shower was one of those glass-door, stand up thingies. It fit both of us, but barely. Once we were both wet (ha ha) we went straight for the soap. Ashley took her time rubbing her hands up and down my chest and stomach. Thank God for crew. Man, I tried to picture Ashley rubbing down my pudgy, pale high school body and just couldn't see how it would ever have happened.</p>
<p>I reached over to Ashley to do the same, but she rebuffed me. Then she went back to my torso.</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm the one that won the..."</p>
<p>She shushed me, then took her time, getting me nice and slippery. As if on impulse, she dropped her right hand down and cupped my balls. Gently, lovingly, with revenance and awe. Then she slid her soapy hand up my shaft. Squeezed. Testing. I looked up at her face. She was focused on her work. An artist with her brush.</p>
<p>I took the opportunity, grabbed a squirt of body wash, and started on her shoulders. Then I slowly slid my hands down her front. I brushed past her breasts. Let her nipples prickle at my palms. Ashley sighed and squeezed my cock. Reward for my good work.</p>
<p>There are few things in this world as wonderful as wet, slippery breasts. And Ashley had the most wonderful mounds I'd ever laid anything on. Her precious titties proudly pointed forward as I hefted them in my foamy fingers.</p>
<p>Ashley knelt down. Her breasts squipped right out of my hands. My penis was now lip level. Oh my god. Oh my GOD!</p>
<p>She winked at me. Then she started cleaning my legs. Dammit. That tease.</p>
<p>As Ashley worked, I ran my hands through her impossibly springy, dirty blonde hair. After a moment, I pulled her up by her armpits. Ashley smiled at me coyly. Her little tongue darted in and out. I kissed her. Hard. Our tongues twisted and twirled. She smelled like peach shampoo and girl cum.</p>
<p>As we kissed, Ashley's hands slid down to my cock and she started working it again. I put my hands on her breasts. Massaged and tweaked. Ashley disengaged from the kiss. She rested her head on my shoulder. Then she angled her slit up against my shaft. Nestled my hardness into her soft center.</p>
<p>And then stopped.</p>
<p>"Oh, that is nice," she said, "Isn't it just... oh... so good."</p>
<p>"Yeah," I grunted. Whatever speaking power I had was being shunted down to the reproduction control center nestled between my legs. Little left for more than monosyllabic responses.</p>
<p>Ashley was pushing me back into the tile wall with just her hairy little hole. The shower water spit and spattered.</p>
<p>"Oh Jason... Oh JJ. Little Jay...bird. Not so... not so little are we? Oh Jay Bird you feel my clitty rubbing... rrrruuuubbbbing up against you? Oh that's... I don't know if I can hold back... Do you feel me? Do you feel my little clitty? She wants you so badly..."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Oh... I don't know if I can stop... So wet. So hot..."</p>
<p>Ashley dragged herself over me for every adjective. Wwwwet. Hhhhhot. I found my hands were running through her hair. My fingers caught on her golden ringlets.</p>
<p>"I... I'm getting so close... Are you getting close, Jay Bird?"</p>
<p>"... Yeah... Oh yeah."</p>
<p>"Don't blow yet... oh no... you can't... can't cum. Not yet. Not before... I... I cum..."</p>
<p>Oh Ashley... so obsessed with who went first. She must've been a bitch in grade school. She gasped then, giggled, shook a little, her hands tightening on my shoulders for purchase. Then she started the process again, dragging herself up and over me. My cock throbbed. It screamed. She stepped away. Wrapped her clever little hands over my shaft. Pulled and rubbed at the skin. Slowing me down. Speeding me up. Her other hand found my balls for a second. Just cradled them, in her palm. She looked up at me, eyes earnest.</p>
<p>"You... you wanna put it in me. Don't you?"</p>
<p>Ashley's soft little blue eyes seemed to plead, wet and wonderful while she continued to massage my member.</p>
<p>"Yeah. So bad..."</p>
<p>"Just spread my legs and plow inside me? Drive and drive and drive and then fill me with your precious... Oh god, JJ, I want to feel you so bad. I want your cock inside my hungry little puss. Oh, Jason..."</p>
<p>Ashley slid forward again, hands around my back now, her pussy pressed to my cock, pinning me outside her opening. Cruel, using the very thing I desired to keep me away.</p>
<p>"Oh JJ. Little Jay Bird... My pussy is so hot for you. I want you in me... so badly. Do you want that baby? Fill me up? Blast your hardness into me again and again. Make me scream for you. Beg for you?"</p>
<p>Ashley reached down and took my cock in her hand. She held it tight, then adjusted it upwards, like lifting a massive lever, and guided the head right to her steaming entrance. I felt the tip of her lips hug the head of my cock.</p>
<p>"Oh Jason, you want to fuck me so bad... Tell me... Beg me to put your cock in me."</p>
<p>"Oh... Oh God. Yeah. Please Ash. Please. Let me go... Let me go inside you. Oh please, Ash. Pleasepleaseplease."</p>
<p>"But Jason... So wrong. You can't put your cock inside... inside your little sister..."</p>
<p>My eyes popped wide. I nearly leapt out of Ashley's hands. Right back into the tile wall. She had me cornered. I shivered a little. All that hot water couldn't keep me from feeling so cold.</p>
<p>"Come on JJ, give it to your little sis. I've been such a good little girl. Don't you wanna put it in me? Give me my reward? I promise I'll be ssssooooooo good to you."</p>
<p>Ashley prowled forward, dragging her body over me as she hissed the 'ssssooooo' out. My cock practically rippled in response. The press and pressure. I wasn't going to last. Oh... Oh god...</p>
<p>I'd thought Ashley was so quiet. So shy. When we'd first met on the boat before she seemed like a little sheep, so sweet and soft with wooly, yellow hair. This was a wolf. A demon. Taunting and testing me.</p>
<p>"Oh, Jason... So bad... Give your little sister what she deserves. Come on. You heard what I said outside with Kristen. Put your cock in me. Take my virgin pussy and make me scream. Make me beg. Beg you for your big strong brother cum."</p>
<p>"Ashley this isn't... I don't..."</p>
<p>"I'm not on the pill, you know... There's no... Oh, Jason, you could... Your amazing, enormous big brother cock inside me... no condom... You gonna put your big bare penis in me and make me... Fill me up so full..."</p>
<p>I tried to shuffle out of the way but Ashley held me to the wall. Rubbed her pussy up and down me. Electric pulses of pleasure went right up my shaft. Down my legs, up my arms. She put her hands behind my neck and kissed me, lightly on the lips. Pulled herself up and forward. Wrapped her legs around my waist. Moved up and down me like climbing a tree. Moaned deep and long.</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>Then Ashley's face changed, signaling the end of her little sister character and the return of regular old, incredibly horny Ashley. She stepped down and stared up at me.</p>
<p>"I know you think it's bad, Jason. I don't know what Katie said to... to guilt you into feeling like this, but she's wrong. OK? I'm telling you she's wrong. I... I'll tell you a secret, OK? No one knows this. Not any of my ex-boyfriends or Katie or even...ha!... even my parents. Just you. And my therapist, I guess, but she doesn't count.</p>
<p>OK? Here goes."</p>
<p>Ashley backed away from me a bit. Gave our bodies some space. As she spoke she idly traced my pecs with her pointer finger.</p>
<p>"When I was younger, but not so young, if you get what I mean. I was 18 and all if that's what you're worried about. My brother and I... Well he used to come into my room. Kinda like what Kristen was talking about before. Right? The lights are out, everyone's in bed. Just tiptoe down the corridor and...</p>
<p>He started by rubbing my shoulders. Then my arms and back. One day he... he let me watch him do it. The next time, I showed him mine. My cum. Our ultimate expression of personal pleasure - we shared it with each other. He'd come in a tissue the first few times. Then he let me hold it in my hands. On... on my tits. In my mouth. In my hungry little puss. Finally. God you have no idea what I had to go through to get him to finally stick it in me and... Fuck it was so good. It's not like... It's not like with other men, Jason, or like with other girls for him. It's just not. There's this connection between the two of us, well...</p>
<p>We liked to change it up. Make it fun. We'd do this. This game I'm playing with you now. I'd play and prance, demand and tease and beg, and he'd... he'd give me what I wanted. What I deserved. And look - look at me."</p>
<p>She reached up and held my chin so I couldn't look away.</p>
<p>"There's nothing wrong with me. I'm not broken or... or fucked up. I'm just normal, happy, me. Very happy, being honest. I like you guys. You're fun. Maybe not perfect or particularly healthy, but fun. I want to help you be happy. I may not like everything you are Jason, but I still think you deserve to be happy. And I'm telling you, your little sis? Emma? She wants this. Almost as bad as you do. So..."</p>
<p>She leaned forward. Pulled me tight. Let her taut titties brush against my chest hair. Brought her sex right up next to mine. Open. Waiting. Vulnerable.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Jason," Ashley said, back to her little sister self, "Just say the word and I'll stop."</p>
<p>She reached down and grabbed my cock in a vice grip.</p>
<p>"Just... just say 'I'm sorry little sis but I can't put my cock in you.'"</p>
<p>She lifted my penis, nested it in the furrow between her tantalizing lips. She sort of ran herself up and back. Let me stimulate her center without ever sliding in. I swore I felt her clit, hard, against my shaft.</p>
<p>"I... I can't stop Jason. You have to make me stop. You have to tell your little sister to get off... Hee hee, already getting off. Ohhhhh... You have to tell me to let you go. Or I won't. I can't. You'll be inside my wet pussy, just covered in my wonderful wet sister stuff and making me cum, Filling me up with your... oh...oh...oh! Your cum. Your sperm.</p>
<p>"All for me. Right there. Right into my womb, baby. Nothing to stop it. Nothing to stop you. Just... just... tell me. Tell me to stop. Please Jason, stop me. Oh, I need... I need you to stop me before I... before you... burst."</p>
<p>Ashley froze then. I felt her hand on my shoulder, so tight. Holding on for dear life. Then she was angling me upwards again. Towards her... towards everything. She let my cock go. My penis in its place. Put her arms around my neck again. Kissed me sweetly with teasing tongue and teeth. My cock stayed in place. Right at her entrance. Just a little lean forward and we'd be... we'd be fucking.</p>
<p>"Do you want your baby sis, JJ?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>I felt weak everywhere but my crotch. My penis so impossibly strong.</p>
<p>"I... Ashley I..."</p>
<p>"Nuh uh uh. Little sister. Baby sis. Tell your baby sis what you're gonna do with that big, bad cock of yours. I won't just take it. I'll...I'll beg you for it. Cry and plead for your big brother cum in my belly. Say you want it and it's yours.""</p>
<p>"Little sis. Baby sister, I... "</p>
<p>"That's time guys!"</p>
<p>My actual little sister, Emma, yelling from outside the bathroom.</p>
<p>"That was way more than 20 minutes," she shouted, "Come on, time for the rest of us to have some fun."</p>
<p>Ashley simply jumped down from my body and reached back, switching off the shower. Just like that, she went from horny babe to business-like and I was left with nothing except whiplash.</p>
<p>Ashley cracked the door open, took a towel, then handed me one. I stood. Still in shock. Dripping.</p>
<p>"Ashley..." I tried to speak but the words were caught somewhere in my midsection, "Ashley I'm..."</p>
<p>"That was fun," she said, "Maybe a little too much fun." I swear her puffy pink, pussy lips were practically smiling at me.</p>
<p>"But Ashley, I..." What was I gonna say? How did I even begin? My body, my brain, my penis, were all pulling in different directions and all it did was make me ache.</p>
<p>"You were really good at that," Ashley said, "The role play stuff. I thought maybe we were gonna do more, but... well, I guess I'm just not that into penis. Even practically perfect ones."</p>
<p>Somehow I felt even dirtier following our shower than I ever had before it.</p>
<p>Remember last time? When my balls went beyond blue to orange to flaming hot white? I told you all that stuff about how I was walking around with a huge, targeted missile between my legs and I just couldn't get it down? Let me tell you something, that was nothing compared to where I was after that shower with Ashley.</p>
<p>I tossed my towel down and joined everyone else, already naked. Every time I moved, breathed, bent even slightly my balls fucking ACHED. Practically screamed. I was so full of cum it was, I kid you not, dripping out of my cock, unbidden. I imagined skyscrapers would bend in comparison to my own erection's magnificence. This was beyond aroused to some other place of actual, physical pain.</p>
<p>"That must have been some shower," Sam said.</p>
<p>"You have no idea."</p>
<p>I practically sobbed as I sat down. I felt so full, so hard, I was worried I might impregnate the carpet just by sitting on it. I did my best to look away.</p>
<p>"Whose deal?" Ashley asked, as if we'd been coming back from a smoke break and not... y'know... that.</p>
<p>I was dying. And yet, oh good Lord, I had no idea how dead I was about to be.</p>
<p>"It's such a nice day out," Ashley said suddenly, "I think we should make this the last round."</p>
<p>She looked at me as she spoke, eyes narrow and cold. Seriously? This, the girl who had practically driven the game to what it was now, wanted to call it a day?</p>
<p>"It is really nice out," Kristen said, "It'd be nice to get some sun. Maybe go for a swim. While we can, you know?"</p>
<p>Fucking hell.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Emma said, "We've all had some fun. Fuck it, let's call it before things get weird."</p>
<p>Was she serious? I shook my head but didn't say anything. When the girls say it's over, that's the end of it. Even in dirty, sexy time. Especially in dirty, sexy time, actually. I had no choice but to agree. Everyone smiled. A nice friendly finish.</p>
<p>Riiiiiiight.</p>
<p>We were all leaving early the next morning to go back to school. The way we were leaving things, I wondered if I'd ever see any of them again. Besides my sister, of course. Even Em. For all I'd done to try to keep things normal between us, it was clear we would never be able to go back to what it was. For all my efforts to save us, I'd done nothing but destruction.</p>
<p>I was wrong, of course. About everything. I think I was so worked up, I just didn't see what was really happening. Ash's declaration wasn't the end of the game, just the beginning of everyone's end game. All the signs were there: the intentions, the accusations. We were headed exactly where everyone wanted to go. I was just too cooked to notice how we were going along.</p>
<p>I'd just dealt. That meant we had four hands left for the deals to go the whole way around and the game to officially end: Kristen, Sam, Ashley, and Emma. I'll tell you a secret. We wouldn't even make it past the second hand.</p>
<p>Hand one was anticlimactic in every sense of that word. Sam won a kiss from Ashley and stupidly, I thought it was a sign for how the rest of the game would go. Stupid stupid stupid.</p>
<p>Hand two went in an entirely different direction. I was trying to be the hero, once again, and it would backfire on me in the worst way possible, one last time.</p>
<p>Sam dealt. Sam was last to act. Ashley folded. Emma bet oral. Holding a Jack, and thinking I was somehow Mr. Smooth, I called. Emma just glared at me, knowing I wasn't really agreeing to something, just squashing her bet. I'd just made a tremendously dickish move. In all senses of that phrase.</p>
<p>"Really?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>"Play your own cards," I said, unaware of all the cosmic karma I was calling down on myself.</p>
<p>Kristen called, also. So me, Mr. Genius here, thought that Ashley was pissed, not because I was doing my sister dirty in all the ways she DIDN'T wanted me to, but because Ashley was suddenly thinking she should've stayed in the hand. OK, I'll stop foreshadowing. Here it comes.</p>
<p>Sam's turn. He made a big show of looking at his card, but I knew he was folding. We hadn't gone head to head, literally or figuratively, in two days because neither of us was particularly interested in the potential consequences. We had an unwritten rule, right? He was going to make a big show and then fold his...</p>
<p>"I raise," Sam said.</p>
<p>Wait. What?</p>
<p>"What's the bet?" Emma asked.</p>
<p>"Not sure yet," Sam said, "Thinking about it."</p>
<p>"You taking suggestions?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>Sam smiled at her, hungrily.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna say... anal."</p>
<p>Sam smiled, self-satisfied. He rested his card carefully on the ground. Something about what he said, the way he said it, my brain just broke. Like I said, all my thinky parts were in my penis and not thinking. I guess I just... I dunno. I'm trying to explain what I did in a way that makes sense and that's kinda hard when I know that what I did was nonsensical. Un-senseable. Insensitive.</p>
<p>Ashley was already out and she kinda shrugged as if to say, yeah, well, been there done that. Emma then called and, if I was upset before I was positively livid now.</p>
<p>This was his big revenge? That piece of shit had gone too far. Yes, I'd fucked Sam's girlfriend the night before. I wasn't the one that raised her to that and I wasn't the one who had just been cheating on her the very hand before, but fine. I was the bad guy. I got that.</p>
<p>But now I saw that Sam had spent all day setting this up. This moment. No matter what he'd said before about forgiveness or acceptance or whatever, he was going to get his revenge on me. I thought I had it figured. Sam was going after Kristen - the girl that he knew I wanted - and make me watch. OK, kind of petty, but whatever. I'd seen it coming and I'd accepted it a while ago. But that wasn't enough, oh no. That asshole wanted to fuck my sister up hers. Add injury to insult.</p>
<p>I'd seen the backdoor show with Sam and Ashley the night before. No lube. Sam totally focused only on his own pleasure. I wasn't having it. I was the big brother. I was going to jump in and protect my little sister. I didn't give a fuck that she'd called, that it was her choice, whatever.</p>
<p>I wasn't gonna have it. I wouldn't let him. I saw one choice, one chance, and I took it.</p>
<p>"I raise to a fuck," I said (Out of turn, I might add. But, y'know, the idea that this was poker in any way shape or form had fled long, long ago).</p>
<p>You see those movies where everyone hears something and they gasp, in unison? And you think, ha, that's cute, that never happens in real life? Yeah, well, everyone sucked in their breath at the same moment I spoke. So it happened. Extra super dramatic. So there you go.</p>
<p>It was the perfect bet, of course, and I patted myself on the back for thinking of it. Kristen would call or she wouldn't, that was win-win for me right there. Sam, of course, would never call and Emma would lay it down, as well. Right? Perfect play - worst case is I cock block Sam with two hands to go and little to no hope of getting back up on his horse.</p>
<p>Kristen called. Oh. My. God. I'd done it. I'd won. Best play of the night by far and...</p>
<p>"Call."</p>
<p>I looked up. Sam. Sam had just said that. He looked me in the eye and mouthed the word again.</p>
<p>"Call."</p>
<p>Oh my GOD! Oh no oh no ohno ohno...</p>
<p>Emma folded in disgust, but I barely noticed through my terror. My stomach ached in time with my balls. My mouth tasted like vomit. The whole boat seemed not to just rock, but spin.</p>
<p>OK, I told myself. Maybe this wasn't so bad. Maybe I had Sam beat and I could just... y'know, tell him to fuck off? Or Kristen had us both and so she'd choose me because, let's be honest, there was no way she would choose to lose her virginity to fucking Sam. Right? I mean, come on that just wasn't gonna...</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>I showed my Jack. Kristen sighed and showed a ten. Ashley shot her a look.</p>
<p>"What? I thought it'd be fun," Kristen said.</p>
<p>Ashley grumbled to herself something that sounded like, "...fucking virgin my wet dripping cunt..."</p>
<p>Well, see, that worked out perfectly fine. Yup, no worries here because Sam would show his measly...</p>
<p>Ace. ACE! Sam turned it over with the shy look of someone who knows he's probably misbehaved and is far too happy to care about it. That motherfucking... I mean, seriously. Ace. Seriously?</p>
<p>"Don't worry, big guy," Sam said, "You can sit this one out."</p>
<p>I was too devastated to even start coming up with a smart comeback.</p>
<p>We had the usual back and forth where Emma tried to help Kristen get out of the situation. But oddly, this time, Kristen didn't seem all that interested in escape. In fact she seemed accepting, maybe even a little excited. She'd made her bed and I guess she'd decided she might as well fuck in it.</p>
<p>I mean, for future reference, I'm all for the public disposition of virginity. It's gonna be the big issue on my 2024 presidential ticket. Universal healthcare, tax code reform and public, nationally broadcast deflowerings for all. I mean, who's not voting for that? But not with Kristen. Not with my girl - the closest thing I had to a little sister besides my actual little sis.</p>
<p>Since Sam won, he decided he had full power to, ummm, set the scene. Based on size difference only (Kristen had a good four inches over Sam) and not other, more self-interested considerations, it was agreed that Kristen's first time would be from behind. Everyone scrambled to set things up for the big event. It was like watching preparations for the world's strangest tea party. Or a really fucked up bridal shower.</p>
<p>Emma slid out the kitchen table to give Kristen something to lean on from the waist up. It seemed a shame to pick a position that kept Kristen's immensely stupendous breasts and incomparable, unfathomable long hair out of the way, but that's what Sam wanted. I wanted to look down on him for such a stupid decision, but then I'd bet him into this spot in the first place so maybe I needed to just shut up.</p>
<p>Not-so-innocent Krissy then leaned forward, her legs just long enough to touch the floor, putting her pussy up in the perfect position for penetration. She didn't make a sound. The whole time, Sam just stood back like he was watching the Geek Squad install his new 72" TV. Proud, excited, maybe a little nervous, but mostly just raring to go.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna hold her hand, just for the first part," Emma announced. She grabbed hold of Kristen's right with her own. Like these were things that needed to be justified. Emma could have squeezed Kristen's boobs for the whole process and no one was gonna say boo. In fact, why the fuck was Emma only holding her friend's hand? Yet another decision that seems, in retrospect, like kind of a missed opportunity...</p>
<p>For the most part, I stood aside and stewed. If Sam was the owner of a new super mega TV in this metaphor, then I was the wife - sulking that my husband had spent all our money on stupid toys. I know. The only person I should have been mad at was myself.</p>
<p>I mean, I was pretty much literally responsible for the entire debacle, start to finish. Looking back, I should have been magnanimous or, at least, not a tremendous fuckwad. Kristen wasn't my girlfriend. I might have pined for her, but that was a secret forest I'd never taken her to. Or even made casual mention of. And, again, it was her decision. Hers. Had I been more mature - acted like a responsible, worthy adult - maybe things would have ended up better all around.</p>
<p>Yup, a young woman was about to lose her cherry to, essentially, a total stranger in front of a bunch of other people (some of them also strangers) and all I could think of was my own bruised ego. I'm a real class act, I am.</p>
<p>Kristen was in position - head down, ass up. Her hand was in the safe hold of her bestest buddy. Her golden hair splayed out in amazing rays over the brown, wood table. Beautiful as the sun.</p>
<p>Sam stood behind her, stretching like getting ready for a track meet. Ashley was whispering at his side. I stood directly across from the action. If Kristen lifted her head instead of resting it on her right cheek, she'd be staring right at me. I was angry, upset. Resigned and relegated.</p>
<p>But before we could begin, I did have one last bit of the knife to twist.</p>
<p>"You've gotta put on a condom, Sam," I said, arms crossed. Eyes dark.</p>
<p>"What? No. No fucking way, man. Fuck that shit. I'm not wearing a fucking condom. You didn't rubber up when you... Last night, I mean. You didn't wear protection. Why should I?"</p>
<p>"I should have. It was a mistake and I shouldn't have done that. We should have stopped and... Look man, it's Kristen's first time. You can't go bareback in her you just... can't. It's not right."</p>
<p>"No. You know what? Just no. I'm not fucking doing it. I don't have any diseases or whatever, it's not fucking happening. Understood?"</p>
<p>"He's right, Sam."</p>
<p>Ashley. On my side, somehow from across the room. How had that happened? She continued,</p>
<p>"It's her first time. You're not knocking her up on her first time. Plus the condom's lubricated... It'll help her."</p>
<p>"Yeah, come on Sam," Emma said, "You have to respect her. Right Krissy?"</p>
<p>"Yeah..." Kristen said, more to the table, "Yeah, if it'll help. Definitely."</p>
<p>Sam just grunted, but he stepped away from Kristen's opening. He waited, impatiently, while Ashley skipped off. She came back with the package, she tore it open herself, and rolled it over Sam's cock, almost lovingly. That seemed like a heck of a consolation prize to me, but Sam acted like it was some horrible indignity.</p>
<p>"Happy now?" he asked. I shrugged.</p>
<p>"It's for her, man, not for me."</p>
<p>"Whatever."</p>
<p>Sam stepped up again. Ashley put her hand to his chest.</p>
<p>"You ready up there, honey?" she called forward.</p>
<p>"Uh huh," Kristen muttered.</p>
<p>"Maybe warm her up some first?" Emma asked.</p>
<p>Sam nodded and put his hand out, slowly rubbing Kristen's sex with his thumb and fingers. He'd explored this cavern before and was starting to know the quirks of the layout.</p>
<p>Kristen smiled, lying there like a cat in a sunbeam. She stretched her arms forward, just like a happy feline would, too.</p>
<p>"Ohhh, that's really nice, Sam," she said, "Little softer maybe?"</p>
<p>Sam didn't say anything but I saw him shift slightly and Kristen again started to purr happily.</p>
<p>"Mmmmmmmm..."</p>
<p>"You ready, baby?" Emma asked.</p>
<p>"I... I think so..." Kristen said, "Kinda hard to know when I've never..." She kept talking but it was all to the table. I couldn't hear a word.</p>

<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>Sam took his fingers, now lightly dusted in Kristen's marinade, and lubed up his penis. He put his other hand on Kristen's ass and then gradually moved himself into position. Then slightly slid forward.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Kristen broke out of her mumbling, "Hey Jay. Jason?"</p>
<p>I suddenly straightened.</p>
<p>"Come... come here for a sec," Kristen said. If Sam noticed, he didn't show it. At least he had the decency to not just... drive it home.</p>
<p>Kristen's eyes were wide as saucers and her mouth was even wider. Her tongue slightly lolled out. I looked at Emma. She just shrugged, holding her bestie's hand to her chest, protectively.</p>
<p>"That good?" I asked when I got close enough to whisper.</p>
<p>"Can't... can't tell," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"There's her hymen," I heard Ashley tell Sam.</p>
<p>"Jason," Kristen said, "JJ. Jay bird."</p>
<p>My sister's pet names for me. She'd been using them all night, I noticed. Spoken not in the mocking way that Kate or Ashley had used them, but like Emma herself did. With love, affection and even a little awe.</p>
<p>"I... Oh! Careful that... Just... just go slow Sam, OK?"</p>
<p>He grunted back.</p>
<p>Kristen motioned for me to come closer. Her lips brushed my ear. Sam was still plumbing her depths. I saw Kristen's free hand was knuckle-white on the table.</p>
<p>"Jason," Kristen whispered, "I just wanted you to know... I... I wish it was you."</p>
<p>And then Kristen's eyes rolled back into her head and she screamed in pain as Sam busted through her maidenhead.</p>
<p>A little tear ran down her cheek, but her face stayed still. When she had her breath back she continued,</p>
<p>"OK? I wish it was you that was doing... Yeah?"</p>
<p>I leaned in and kissed her lightly on the lips.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Yeah, me too."</p>
<p>I looked up at Emma to see if she'd heard and clearly, she had. She just smiled at me, a sad little wistful thing. Then suddenly, my anger drained away like Kristen and Emma had pulled the plug from me. I started filling back up again, but with sad.</p>
<p>"Just... just wait a sec..." Kristen called back, "Ssssssooooo... So full... I just, I just gotta get used to it."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Sam said, "Yeah of course. OK. Just let me know."</p>
<p>Sam wasn't a jerk, by any means but he wasn't exactly a gentle lover, either. I'm sure Kristen's comments about his size made him a little more willing to do things her way, though. Smart girl.</p>
<p>But the position Sam'd chosen said it all, really. was Kristen's first time and I don't think Sam really thought about it - how it should have been for Kristen. He was interested in fucking her for his own sake. That's not how a girl's first time ought to be, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Emma leaned in and whispered into Kristen's ear, though I could hear it all, easily.</p>
<p>"You think that's big," she said, "Maybe it's a good thing you chose the starter penis before getting on our big boy over there."</p>
<p>Emma nodded knowingly at my turgid cock. He popped a little in approval. Kristen kind of giggled. A pained little laugh.</p>
<p>"Yeah... probably..." Kristen told Emma.</p>
<p>"You OK down there?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, Kristen - quiet, conservative Christian Kristen - transformed into someone very vocal and even a little rude once someone started at her. We knew the shock and pain had drained away, then, because she started talking. It was like getting the whole play-by-play on her first foray into fucking.</p>
<p>"That's... yeah... OK. I think I'm used to it a little. Just go ahead and..."</p>
<p>"You sure?"</p>
<p>"Yeah... yeah. Sure. Go for it."</p>
<p>"What's it...?" Emma started, then realized maybe now was not the best time for a Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>"It's... he's inside me it's... strange. I feel so... so full. Like I never realized I was empty until something was in me and I... OH! He's working back and forth with me and it's like I can feel every ridge. Every bump. Every bit of him. AH, wait. Kinda hurts, too, though..."</p>
<p>I watched as Kristen slowly slid on the table, forced back and forth by Sam's furtive movements. I thought about how it would have been with me and realized I'd betrayed her. Like I'd done with my sister.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>I leaned into Kristen.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," I said.</p>
<p>"F... for what?"</p>
<p>"I should've... I'm just sorry."</p>
<p>"Don't... oh that's nice... don't be sorry, OK?"</p>
<p>I stood up and watched, doing my best to keep my eyes on Kristen's reactions, rather than to what was causing them. She kept her eyes all scrunched up, made hot white nail marks in Emma's palms. Lay there and let Sam go as well as she could. The rollercoaster starts, you realize that you do not want to be on it, but at that point there's nothing to do but ride out your misery and hope for a quick end.</p>
<p>"That's... that's nice that's...ow, hang on just... your penis is like, it's jabbing me at a weird angle and it's like... oh wait, oh there it is. That's nice...OW... fuck, why am I so sore, it's just..."</p>
<p>"You want me to... you know?" Sam asked. He clearly did not want to... you know. His face was bright red and little bits of sweat ran down his face, his chest, his arms. He was bent over at the stomach like an old man on a walker, hands gripping Kristen's shapely buttocks. He didn't even pause as he asked if he should pause.</p>
<p>"No no... it's ok... keep... keep at it," Kristen said. Sam kept at it.</p>
<p>"It's...oh it's such a strange feeling, I've never... No wait, slow down... just slow down for a sec, OK?"</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Kristen, her blonde hair pasted to her forehead, her eyes no longer wide but small and not so much frightened as just... frustrated.</p>
<p>"It's feels like... kinda dry," she said, "Like I need to make more lubrication or just... I feel like I'm covered him in my stuff but it's like, kinda burning and OH!... Oh no, keep... keep going Sam, just... just keep... ffffffffuuuuuck."</p>
<p>Her head down now, Kristen stopped talking. The table gave little creaks... faster, faster then finally Sam threw his head back and...</p>
<p>"Ahhhhhhhhhhh," he shouted to the ceiling, arms thrown back.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Kristen said, she looked back.</p>
<p>Sam's head was down. His hands gripped her ample buttocks as he rocked back and forth, ever slower.</p>
<p>"Oh, Sam," Kristen asked, sort of aroused, sort of confused, "Sammy, did you cum?"</p>
<p>"Oh. Oh yeah," Sam said. He staggered back. Leaned against the wall and caught his breath.</p>
<p>"Kristen that was awesome. You're fucking awesome babe, you know that?"</p>
<p>"Thanks," Kristen said, kind of blushing.</p>
<p>"Did you... y'know?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"It's OK baby. Maybe if you just..."</p>
<p>Sam answered by ripping off the condom. Then he threw it up against my wall where it stuck with a splat. There was a little streak of red blood running along the side. The last of Kristen's innocence, just tossed aside. He couldn't even use a fucking trashcan for it?</p>
<p>I put my hand on Kristen's shoulder and rubbed it, lightly. I just didn't know what to do. I'd always heard people say their first time was awful, but I'd never really understood how until that moment. I mean, I'm sure my first time was terrible but my girlfriend had been around a bit, and well, it's always good for the guy, no matter how bad he is so...</p>
<p>"First time's always bad, hon," Ashley said, "Don't worry, it gets better. Way better."</p>
<p>"Yeah, OK," Kristen said, still lying on her stomach. "It was nice, really, I got it. It just, I dunno it was weird, I just couldn't get wet enough and then the way Sam's penis was pushing into me and it just felt so big and my... I just felt sore, that's all. And a little dry... No it was really good. It was really fun. I'm really really glad I did it. Really."</p>
<p>"OK, well, you guys clean yourselves up, OK? We've still got a couple of hands to go," Ashley said.</p>
<p>Kristen groaned, then started to roll off the table. But Emma, still at the beautiful blonde's side, sort of gently pushed her back down. Then Emma bent over and rested her forehead on Kristen's. They shared a warm, weak little smile. Emma smiled wider and kissed her bestie right on the lips.</p>
<p>"Hang on," Emma said, "Hand's not over."</p>
<p>Everyone stopped. Ashley was already sitting back at the circle, shuffling the cards. Sam was walking out of the bathroom, his penis flaccid and fulfilled. I stood to the side, as confused as anyone.</p>
<p>"We didn't finish the bet," Emma said.</p>
<p>"It's cool," Sam said, "Jason you're off the hook. Though I'm sure it'd be a heck of time for both of us."</p>
<p>He winked, like we could ever share the same in-joke, now.</p>
<p>"That's fine," Emma said, "But not what I meant. Sam, Jason and Kristen, you were all in the hand when Jason raised to fuck. Everyone called and then showed their cards, right?"</p>
<p>I looked over at my sister and raised an eyebrow. Where was she going with this?</p>
<p>"Right," Sam said, "I had the Ace so both Jason and Kristen owed me a fuck. But I'm commuting Jason's sentence because... ew. Just no dude."</p>
<p>"Jason, what card did you have?" Emma asked.</p>
<p>"I had the jack of diamonds," I said, my old lucky card from fucking Kate. All hail the mighty jack of diamonds.</p>
<p>"And Kristen?"</p>
<p>"I had the 9, I think?" Kristen said from the table. It was weird the way she was just lying there, splayed. "No wait, I had the 10. Sorry, it was the 10 of hearts. Sorry."</p>
<p>"Don't be sorry," Emma said. She looked at me, her eyes asking: 'you see where I'm going with this now?' I looked back in a way that said 'no, no I do not.'</p>
<p>"Are we all good here?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Ugh. Really people?" Emma slapped her bare thigh with her palm, "You'd think that when you have the chance to... Whatever. Sam's Ace beat both Jason's and Kristen's cards. So Sam gets a fuck from Jason and Kristen. But Jay's jack beat Kristen's ten. So she still owes him a fuck."</p>
<p>Wait. Wait what? Holy fucking jack of diamonds! Lord of all cards, may the jack of diamonds forever be hallowed, holy fucking fuck!</p>
<p>"Emma I..." I started, but stalled.</p>
<p>"She's right, I guess," Ashley shrugged, "Does it matter?"</p>
<p>"Emmy I don't think I want to..." Kristen started. Emma shushed her, then turned and whispered,</p>
<p>"It'll be alright. Trust me."</p>
<p>""Kristen owes me a fuck I guess technically? But, ummm, I don't want to do anything that would... I mean she said she's pretty sore so..."</p>
<p>"It's OK," Emma said, "She's totally fine. Right Krissy? Tell him you're totally fine."</p>
<p>Kristen gave her bestie a look that said she was most certainly not fine. Emma knelt down and the two of them bickered back and forth for a moment. All I could really make out was Emma's end point.</p>
<p>"... and I was right, right? It was fucking awesome?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Kristen said, almost dreamily.</p>
<p>"OK, so trust me now. OK?"</p>
<p>The ship tilted and groaned. A little "ooooooo" that seemed strangely dirty in the circumstances.</p>
<p>"OK," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"Good," Emma patted Kristen on the buttocks, like post-pep talk, and then turned to me.</p>
<p>"Go for it, JJ. You're good."</p>
<p>"Go for what?"</p>
<p>Emma gestured at her friend, lying on the table, head buried in her arms, like it was the most natural thing in the world. Throw a fuck into my friend, big guy!</p>
<p>"Emma I don't..."</p>
<p>"Jesus, do I have to... OK, come here."</p>
<p>Emma grabbed my elbow and pulled me to the back of the boat where no one could hear.</p>
<p>"Listen," Emma said, "You owe me big time, buster, so you're gonna do this for me, understood?"</p>
<p>"Emma, I... I don't think that's how this works. I hurt you badly and I solve that by... fucking your best friend? Not even porn is that ridiculous."</p>
<p>"Jason. Jay Bird. I... I'll admit I was really mad at you. Still mad. I'm still pissed at you for all your... bullshit. Look, Sam and I we... well we kind of cooked up this idea where... You know what, it doesn't matter. That's my best friend on the table there and she's hurting. It was her first time and it just totally sucked and I mean, soon it's gonna be my first time and I..."</p>
<p>"Wait, Emma, you're a virgin?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Shut up. Anyway, look, it should have been special for her. You heard what she said. I want you to make it special for her, OK?"</p>
<p>"Emma, I don't want to hurt Kristen. I've already done enough to fuck things up and I don't think fucking's gonna fix it."</p>
<p>"See? That's my point. You're not... you're not standing there just waiting to get your rocks off. I ask Sam for this, you know what he's saying? Hell yeah! And Kristen ends up in the same sucky spot, I promise you. You care about Kristen. You want her to feel good and I know KNOW that you'll make it happen for her. Just like I knew you'd get Kate last night and help Krissy out in our circle jerk this morning. I just... I know my big brother. He always sweeps in and saves the day. That's why I... You're gonna help Kristen. I just know you will."</p>
<p>"This is the weirdest weekend..."</p>
<p>"I dunno, remember Aunt Jack's cocaine wedding at the zoo in San Francisco?"</p>
<p>"Not funny."</p>
<p>"I wasn't joking..."</p>
<p>I groaned in surrender, then I walked over to Kristen's backside.</p>
<p>"So," I rested my hand on her exposed buttock, like it was a bedside table, "How do you want me to..."</p>
<p>Kristen rolled over slightly, searching me. I couldn't read her look. Fear? Desire? A little of both? Her eyes were suddenly like little microcosms of the summer sky. Bright blue with streaks of white. It was hard to tear myself away.</p>
<p>"You're really gonna do her?" Ashley asked, suddenly standing. Cards forgotten.</p>
<p>"Bet's a bet, right?" I looked at Emma. She nodded.</p>
<p>"I was thinking," I continued, "you might enjoy it more if you were on top, could control how we go. Or like, if it was missionary you might..."</p>
<p>"No," Emma said, "same thing. No changes."</p>
<p>"Just do her and be done with it, eh?" Ashley asked.</p>
<p>I looked over at Sam, standing in the corner, staring off into the distance. He hadn't said anything and I felt my stomach clench a little.</p>
<p>"Apples to apples?" I asked, "This isn't some... double-blind, placebo-controlled study we're doing here. I'm trying to do... I'm just trying to help Krissy. Like you said."</p>
<p>Emma crossed her arms and glared me down.</p>
<p>"OK, play that same song."</p>
<p>Gingerly, I helped Kristen roll back onto her stomach. She rested her head onto her folded hands. She shuffled her pudendum a little, putting it back into the starting position.</p>
<p>Her pussy, tight and pink before, now looked red and raw. Maybe a little angry. Already gaping and almost certainly ready. I reached over and ran my finger over Kristen's opening. She made little gasp that sounded like pleasure.</p>
<p>She was plenty wet, I'll tell you. Not Emma dripping, I'll grant, but there are waterfalls that look dry compared to that girl. If I was doing the weather report for Kristen's quim I'd say it was super humid with ongoing showers throughout the day and a 100% chance of penis by the afternoon commute.</p>
<p>Satisfied that Kristen was still in a condition where she might be satisfied I took a condom out of the box that Ashley had brought out and started to tear it open. I thought about asking her to slide it on for me like she'd done for Sam, but figured I was already getting more than anyone could ask for.</p>
<p>"Hang on," Emma said, "No condom."</p>
<p>"Em?" Kristen looked up, surprisingly small and scared.</p>
<p>"Not exactly the same then," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, but what the fuck?" Sam shouted, "What's so special about him that's..."</p>
<p>"You're right Sam," Emma said, "I'm sorry. I just... I think based on what Kristen was saying about staying wet... That is, I'm hoping it might be better for her if there's no condom. Y'know? Like maybe she's allergic or something?"</p>
<p>"Oh what a load of crap," Sam said. He started pacing, swinging his arm like a boxer.</p>
<p>"She might be right," Ashley said, "Some people, the condom just makes it... I mean, it always feels better skin to skin but..."</p>
<p>"Emmy," Kristen said, "I guess that kinda makes sense but I don't want to..."</p>
<p>"Jason's totally clean, right JJ?"</p>
<p>"Umm, yeah, I guess, but I don't want to get Kristen, y'know..."</p>
<p>"I'm not on birth control. The pill," Krissy said, "I mean... it's against the church and I know that sounds kinda stupid now, but..."</p>
<p>Emma pressed on,</p>
<p>"But I'm sure you're in the safe part of your cycle, right? Rhythm method? All that?"</p>
<p>Kristen just shook her head, once, solemnly.</p>
<p>"I think, maybe... I think maybe that's why I've been so... y'know, ummm horny?" Kristen said the word like it was the dirtiest thing that could ever be said, "This whole weekend, my body is just begging for... y'know. Penis. Cock. And stuff..."</p>
<p>"Emma," I said. I'd been down this road, seen the end, turned around and walked back. I could draw the whole thing from memory.</p>
<p>"You'll pull out," Emma said, "Before... y'know?"</p>
<p>"We did the whole 'pull out' thing last time, remember? That did not go well. Well, I mean it did, but..."</p>
<p>"You'll pull out, Jason," Emma said, suddenly serious, staring me down. She crossed the room and then walked me back into the corner.</p>
<p>"You will," Emma said, "When you start to feel like you're gonna cum, you pull out. I don't know why that's so hard for you boys, but... You'll do it on her back or her tits. You'd like that right? Cum all over Krissy's gorgeous titties?"</p>
<p>Holy fuck it was hot to hear Emma talk about her bestie's breasties.</p>
<p>"OK to knock her up on her second time, I guess," Ashley said, chuckling.</p>
<p>"I'm serious, Jason," Emma said, "I don't care if you're glued into that girl. Even one of your potent brother-spermies goes in there, I'll take my fucking revenge. You hear me?"</p>
<p>"Fine," I said, "But then as long as we're making changes, I want Kristen to lie on her back, not her front."</p>
<p>"Fine," Emma said. Tough negotiations, these. You don't see the Camp David accords going into this level of detail. Of course, that's probably because you don't want to watch them, either.</p>
<p>Kristen rolled over on her back, languid and slow. She looked at me, legitimately nervous now. Her breasts shrank from impossibly immense to merely massive when she was on her back.</p>
<p>I know I've spent a lot of time on Krissy's titties but I'll tell you what. Her breasts were fine, but it was her hair - golden, poker straight, cool to the touch, long down to her bottom and thick enough to cover her front - that's what made her so astonishing. She was also pretty as all hell and in good shape from tennis, too. Maybe a little thick but like I said, I like that. Whatever. There was Kristen's fantastic hair and there was everything else. She made Rapunzel look like Captain Picard.</p>
<p>I reached over and gathered Kristen's hair, like pulling up dainty daisies. Then I lowered her locks over her chest, covering her little ears, her chest, her breasts. She smiled at me. I shrugged. A happy little shake.</p>
<p>"When you're ready," Emma said.</p>
<p>I looked down at the amazing woman lying in front of me. Her legs hung open, limply. Her pussy stared back, still gaping, as if to say, 'Well? what are you waitin' for?'</p>
<p>"You ready?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Kristen said, "Yeah, ok."</p>
<p>Just like with Sam. Same sort of half-permission. It would be different, I promised myself. I narrowed the whole world down to just Kristen and me. Her pussy and my cock. I ran my hands up and down her flanks, her butt, her thighs and ankles. Our eyes, already engaged.</p>
<p>As Kristen's lips let way to the head of my raging cock, I saw her pupils widen slightly. I ran my hands through her thick blonde pubes. Traced them from her tummy, down over her pussy to her cute little pucker and then back and around again.</p>
<p>Kristen rested on her elbows. looking down, trying to see our joining. Her mouth hung open slightly. She panted as I pushed in a little further. Made a soft, silent whine.</p>
<p>"That's, that's... Yeah I'm OK," Kristen said.</p>
<p>"Keep talking to me, babe, OK? Just keep... keep telling me what you need."</p>
<p>"I... OK... I need you to go a little deeper. It's... It's still pretty sore, but..."</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>"If you need me to stop, anytime, I'll just..."</p>
<p>"NO! I mean, um, no. No. It's OK. It's still alright so far."</p>
<p>I slid myself in a little further. Kristen's walls hugged my shaft so tight, it was like pushing my penis through molten marshmallow, but every time I went forward her incredible cunt gave a little more. Sucking me in ever deeper.</p>
<p>"Oh... Oh Em he's inside me," Kristen said, "Oh, not like, like all the way but... Oh."</p>
<p>"Good?" I heard Emma as if she were distant, across the room. In another country. Another world entirely from our own. I thought for a moment, about Kristen's little fantasy from before. Her bestie, my sister, stuffing her full with my cock. I thought about suggesting it, then decided it was better to let things be. Focus on the girl. Our joining. Nothing else.</p>
<p>"So good, "Kristen said, she looked up at me and smiled.</p>
<p>"I'm about halfway," I told her.</p>
<p>"Wow. So big. OK," she said, kind of happily, then let her head fall back.</p>
<p>Kristen reached forward with her hands and folded her fingers in mind. She pulled me forward and I followed. Most of the way in now. Kept waiting for her to stop but still pulling, almost dragging. If she could reach my butt, I thought, she'd jam me home, I'm sure of it.</p>
<p>All the way inside her now. Buried to the root. My balls bounced off her beautiful butt, aching every time.</p>
<p>Done getting me in position, Kristen dragged my hands up to her breasts and lay them there. Then she squeezed them down, making me squeeze her. Sort of how I'd showed her how to rub my cock before.</p>
<p>I could barely reach that far from how we were standing- my cock actually went a bit forward, somehow, buried beyond the root. I've no idea how. Kristen's nipples were pink and hard as hell.</p>
<p>"That... that's it?" Kristen asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah," I said, panting in time with her, "Not enough?"</p>
<p>"Ohhhhh no. Nooooo no no no. More than enough. Too much, honestly," Kristen said, then she whined like a little girl, telling on the big mean boy, "Em, you're brother's dick is way too big."</p>
<p>I laughed a little. She almost shuddered from that simple stimulation.</p>
<p>"No," Kristen continued, I'm just... Just waiting for the painful part."</p>
<p>We stood there, like her pussy had froze me in place. Attached at deeper than the hip. I kept rubbing her breasts. Teasing and squeezing. I wished I could lean forward and suckle, even for a little. Fucking beautiful fucking girl.</p>
<p>"Fuck you're tight," I told her. I wasn't kidding. I know, 'tight' to a girl is like 'big' to a guy. It doesn't matter what you feel, or what you don't, you always tell a girl she's tight when you're in there.</p>
<p>But Kristen? Man she was fucking tight! I mean, I expected... she was still sort of a virgin after all, but fuck. I'd been in plenty of women and this... there was just no comparison. When Krissy had popped me in her mouth before, she'd sucked me harder than anything I'd ever known or could imagine. And yet that was like a light gust of air compared to what her pussy was doing to me now. It was squeezing - the crushing, rib breaking, death hug of a constrictor. And it felt so... fucking... amazing...</p>
<p>The only thing that kept me from coming in her that moment was, well, practice. So there. But also, I can't ever really cum standing up. I know, it's a weird thing, but for some reason being upright cuts off the cum signal from my cock to my brain and so I end up lasting forever or falling over. Lucky setup, this.</p>
<p>I looked down at beautiful, still sort of innocent Kristen.</p>
<p>"No I mean it hun, you're... you're really fucking tight."</p>
<p>"I know..." Kristen whined, "I feel you... like, I feel every ridge, every vein, it's like... fuck... this is so much better without the condom... I thought I was feeling it before, but... Holy shit!"</p>
<p>"Good. I'm glad that it worked out."</p>
<p>"You wanna try..."</p>
<p>"Moving around a bit?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Yeah. Just... a little. My body is like... you have no idea, it's just screaming for you to pound me into the table and I just... I don't want it to hurt again, y'know?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," I said, "For the record, I have a pretty good idea of what you're body's trying to get you to do cause..."</p>
<p>We both laughed a little. Her tummy did this little jump each time my cock twitched inside her. Sexy as hell.</p>
<p>"OK. I'm gonna try but... you're so tight baby, I'm afraid I'm gonna cum if I... If I feel it coming I promise I'll..."</p>
<p>"No! No, please don't... please. Just stay. Stay inside me, OK?"</p>
<p>"Yeah... OK. I'll do my best, I'll... Here, hang on... Let me try something else."</p>
<p>I left my left hand on her breast, wrapped up in her hair, and dragged my right over her stomach, through her pubes and up to her clit. I smeared it slightly, back and forth.</p>
<p>"Oh... Oh, that's..."</p>
<p>"Yeah?" I asked. I lifted my thumb up, licked it for lubrication, then stuck it back down and started rubbing again. Slow, languid pace.</p>
<p>"Little faster," Kristen said. I complied.</p>
<p>"Little harder, like, push down a little more."</p>
<p>Ok, then.</p>
<p>"Keep...k...keep rubbing. Faster... oh...oh fuck...push... push down just..."</p>
<p>I started to move my cock back a bit.</p>
<p>"No! No don't, just stay... Stay there. Not yet, OK, not yet. God... feels so fucking GOOD when you're cock's in there. You're not even fucking moving it and I... Ffffffffuck..."</p>
<p>"OK, baby, alright. Whatever you say."</p>
<p>The room filled with the wet sound of me rubbing Kristen's poor, neglected clit. Like an abandoned puppy, it rubbed itself against my thumb with every stroke, just begging for attention. I worked her clitty back and forth, up and down, Kristen wagging and panting, over and over and over again.</p>
<p>"Keep... not like...yeah, side to side... like that."</p>
<p>Well at least the girl was learning what she liked. That's the kind of homework everyone can't wait to get home and start working on.</p>
<p>"Yeah, like that... just... just keep rub...oh! Oh that is sssssooooooo nice. Oh. Oh Emmy your brother, he's... he's rubbing my clitty and it's..."</p>
<p>"I know, Krissy," Emma said, "It's so good, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, like, SO so good. I mean, he... he rubbed me before, but it wasn't... it was nothing like this."</p>
<p>"His cock's good in you?" Emma asked.</p>
<p>"OH! Oh, so good," Kristen said. "Sssssoooo so so so good. I mean, you have to try this it's so..."</p>
<p>"I'll get a boyfriend some day, I suppose. Or a good toy..." Emma said.</p>
<p>"No. Nononono. This one. You have to try it with this one, OK?" Kristen said. I looked down in case Emma's eyes were asking for the same thing. Just focused on my thumbwork.</p>
<p>"It's like... OH, so good. I don't ever want it out. Not ever. I just want him in me, rubbing me forever. I mean, I'll let him go so he can stuff it in you, but other than that...</p>
<p>"OK," Emma said, stifling a laugh, "but remember he has to pull out, right honey? All that stuff about how your body is just begging for a baby. Don't forget, OK?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, no. I know. I don't want to get... Ha! I don't want to get knocked up it's just..."</p>
<p>"I know," Emma said, kind of sadly, "So good."</p>
<p>"That's... that's it Jason," Kristen turned her attention back to me. She let her head loll back, her body tremoring as I kept pressing her clit back and forth against her pubic bone, like running a slide whistle. My fingers started to ache. I kept jilling Kristen for all I was worth.</p>
<p>"OH! Oh it's... I can feel it, it's..." Kristen's head lifted up for a moment, then dropped back, "oooooooohhhhhh so close."</p>
<p>Her pussy clamped a little more around my penis. He pulsed inside her, like a cum but not... At least I didn't think it...</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh wow, I can like... I can feel it move in me. That's so cool..."</p>
<p>"Yeah," I said, trying to stay focused.</p>
<p>"Is that what it's like when he, y'know when he like, shoots his stuff in me?"</p>
<p>"Kinda," I said.</p>
<p>"Wow..."</p>
<p>I started moving my hand even faster. Kristen started shaking faster, too. Her words slurred into each other, everything she said now a grunt or a cry.</p>
<p>"Oh...that'ssogood just...yeah...yes..."</p>
<p>Her head popped up and she stared at me right in the eyes. I watched as her pupils widened, the blue shifting darker than a rainstorm. Her mouth was wide open, her tits practically pinballing off her chest as she shook. The tightest pussy I'd ever felt got much, much tighter. Kristen pulled in every bit of air and then froze. Her arms stiffened. Her legs snapped flat.</p>
<p>Then I saw her relax just a little bit.</p>
<p>"Oh," she squeaked. The same little squeak she'd made the day before when she'd seen my penis the first time.</p>
<p>"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"</p>
<p>She howled, threw her head back, then looked me right in the eyes. Her hand pushed it away from her pussy. We stayed still, like posing for a paining. I searched her face. Then she screamed, throaty and deep,</p>
<p>"Pump me!"</p>
<p>Kristen's head dropped straight back down, almost bouncing on the table. Her legs held me tight and she squeezed me into her - legs somehow even stronger than her hungry mouth, her grasping pussy.</p>
<p>For the first time since I entered Kristen's body, I pulled myself back. I saw her face contort, a mixture of pleasure and regret, and then I shoved forward all over again. I pounded her into the table. It honked and squealed rudely along with every stroke.</p>
<p>"Oh GOD! Keep... keep pumping me."</p>
<p>Kristen's hungry pussy pulled at me, desperate for my cock, straining for the seed that it should not could not have. She groaned as I pulled back, sang as I pressed forward, grunted every time I slammed home. Like she was an instrument and I was playing the absolute fuck out of her.</p>
<p>Oh... Em. Oh...Emmy... He. Your brother. He's... fucking... me. Your... brother... is...fffffffucking...meeeeheeehhheeeeee! So good. So good. I... don't know if I can... I'm so close... I have to..."</p>
<p>"It's ok," Emma said. I saw my beautiful baby sis lean in between Kristen and me, take her best friend's hands and hold them. Squeeze them tight.</p>
<p>"You can do it," Emma said, "Jason can do it, right Jay? Let Jason get you there."</p>
<p>"Oh he's... I feel... Every bit just... pounding... Pounding. He's just... he's driving into me that incredible amazing oh so perfect cock... Oh god! Oh GOD! So... so good... Emma. Em... you're brother's fucking me so good."</p>
<p>"I know sweety."</p>
<p>"Oh fuck," I said, "Fuck sis she's... she's really fucking tight... I don't know..."</p>
<p>"Jason don't..."</p>
<p>"It's OK," Kristen said, "Keep... keep going. I'm close... I'm really really close."</p>
<p>"I'm OK," I said, "I'm close, too but... I'm OK."</p>
<p>"He's... his cock is just drilling into me. OH, my hungry little pussy...and oh, Jay. Jason. Reach down. Squeeze my ass. Yeah, there it is. That's it you beautiful fucking fucker squeeze me tight."</p>
<p>Emma and I shared a look - this was Kristen talking. Kristen screaming and cursing. The girl who once felt guilty for days because she'd said the word 'heck' was saying stuff that made us both blush. Was this the real Kristen, pulled out by my own divining rod? Or some other, strange girl, overcoming the one we'd known and loved?</p>
<p>I slide my thumb down to her little pucker and just let it rest there, lightly, as I still crushed her pink, wobbling cheeks.</p>
<p>"No... more like..."</p>
<p>I slid my hands upwards so I was caressing her thighs more than her bottom.</p>
<p>"Yeah... Yeah. Like that. Oh, I wish your mouth could reach up to bite on my boobs. Oh, Emma, little Emmy, little bestie... I don't know how to... Suck my tits, please... Your... your brother can't reach and I... Jason doesn't mind, right? You don't mind do you, JJ? Just..."</p>
<p>Emma looked at me, searching. Wanting and driven but afraid, still, too.</p>
<p>"It's OK, Em," I said.</p>
<p>Emma bent over and took her best friend's breast in her mouth, forming a tight seal between lips and nipple-flesh.</p>
<p>"OH! Oh GOD! OH..."</p>
<p>"Get there, baby," I cheered her on "You can do it, just let me get you..."</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh Fuck oh fuck oh fuck. I'm close. I'm so fucking close I'm close I...</p>
<p>"Oh, Kristen, you want my cum, right? You want my cum all over your beautiful tits, your amazing lips, your fucking incredible fucking hair... You want my cum. You need it."</p>
<p>"Yeah..." she panted, "Yeah, so bad... I want your... Your cum in... I want it all over me, I want your cum so bad..."</p>
<p>"Then you have to... you have to cum for me first," I said, "You... you have to get there or I... I can't... you have to cum. Please, Kristen, cum baby. Cum for me. Cum on, baby... You were there with little Emmy, you were in the next room and you... you wanted... you wanted so bad. Show me baby. Show... show me. You can't have it unless you show me. Show your little bestie. Cum for her. Cum for me. I want to cum so bad and I need you to... OH, fuck... I need you to..."</p>
<p>"Ahhhhhhh!" Kristen threw her head back. And as tight as her amazingly tight pussy already was... it suddenly got oh so very much tighter. And suddenly I went from maybe a minute away to right... that... moment.</p>
<p>"Kristen, I..."</p>
<p>"Oh, Jason I'm cuuuuuumMMMMMMING!"</p>
<p>"Oh fuck!"</p>
<p>Her cervix slammed down, like squeezing me out.</p>
<p>"Kristen I... ffffuck!!" .</p>
<p>Before I could even think, my cock fucking exploded. Like opening a valve and just... Gone. I tried to pull back, but Kristen's legs kept me tight to her as she shook. Both of us locked in the little death</p>
<p>My balls - so full, aching with driven little sperms all desperate to burst out and find an egg - they emptied like fleeing a burning building. Then refilled and pumped again. Liters. Fucking gallons. An impossible font of fertility. The valve let fly and it was like Krissy's unbelievable little puss was drinking from the fire hose.</p>
<p>I was literally dumping cum into Kristen's unprotected womb. So much I couldn't imagine where it all came from. Here's a blast. Another. Another again. All that. Too much. Much more. Painted her little pussy white. Dripping out in great gobs, so much she couldn't hold it all.</p>
<p>"OH!" She screamed, "OH God! Baby that's... oh that's so GOOD!"</p>
<p>"OH Kristen!" I sobbed.</p>
<p>"It's OK," Kristen said. Suddenly she was up, her arms around me. Cool hair cascading over our shoulders.</p>
<p>Kristen held me tight with her legs, her arms, her lips. We shook against each other. Cumming onto each other. Her pussy just gulp gulp gulped it all down, She shook with each of my blasts, the concussive force of my cum.</p>
<p>"Oh Krissy. Oh god..." I held her tight and shook against her. Unable to do anything but hang on and shake... shake... shake. Somehow my cock was still sliding inside her, like trying to just keep it all going for as long as it could. Pumping back and forth as I pumped her full of seed.</p>
<p>From the deep recesses of the room, I swore I hears Ashley breathe a chant,</p>
<p>"Yeah... Give it to her. Knock her up. Give her what she needs... Yeah..."</p>
<p>Kristen's voice broke through,</p>
<p>"Oh... Oh Emmy... Your brother. He's cumming. Cumming inside me. Making me... Oh GOD. Baby, I couldn't... I know I should have, but... I wanted... I needed it so bad and... It's so good it feels so...so FUCKING good. He's...OH GOD... he's fucking filling me up... His cum. I can feel it. So... so warm... Hot. Oh God, Emmy I'm so... Fuck..."</p>
<p>"It's OK," Emma said, now hugging herself around both of our trembling forms, "I know baby. It's so good. It's OK. I've got you."</p>
<p>We stayed there, coiled around each other, impossible to tell where one of us ended and the other began. Then slowly my penis stopped twitching and our mutual embrace began to break. I started to speak, fumbled. The words felt all clumsy in my mouth.</p>
<p>"Oh God, Kristen I... I'm..."</p>
<p>"No, no," she smiled, sunshine through the raindrops, "It's OK."</p>
<p>Kristen pulled me close again, then kissed my lips tenderly. My forehead, my cheeks, my eyes.</p>
<p>"I'm OK... More than OK... Fuck."</p>
<p>"Still gay?" Ashley asked from someplace far, far away.</p>
<p>"Not even a little bit," Kristen said, contentedly.</p>
<p>"Oh don't worry, baby," Ashley said "I can help you fix that."</p>
<p>To Kristen's credit, she just smiled as if to say, sure, let's give that a whirl. Then she crushed me even tighter to her chest, protective and loving.</p>
<p>I let her hold me there for a long, long while, knowing that, as soon as I looked up, the horrible consequences would be waiting for me. My sister had promised her fucking revenge and now I was going to get it. I didn't know what Ashley was thinking, but I could only imagine how Sam felt.</p>
<p>I was satisfied, satiated beyond all possible comprehension, my body embraced in Kristen's arms, her mouth, her wonderful wet puss. I felt limp. Spent.</p>
<p>Terrified.</p>
<p>So that's it. That's my story. I lost my best friend because I fucked his girlfriend right in front of him. Probably got her pregnant, too. Then I ruined my whole family by fucking around with my sister's feelings. Also, since my little sister wasn't already angry enough, I knocked up her best friend, for good measure. Pretty much a done deal then, this life. Nothing to do but wander the Earth, unwanted and alone.</p>
<p>The End.</p>
<p>Nah. Just kidding. There was still one person left to fuck.</p>
<p>I suppose you're thinking that after Kristen and I finally separated and I unstuck myself from our shared sweat, that my dong came out all shriveled and happy. Like a little kid after too much time at the waterslides. I'm sure you imagine that, by this point, my balls were sore, but empty. That I felt worn down. Well worn.</p>
<p>Not so much.</p>
<p>My cock was hard as rock, a fucking rocket trying desperately to launch into any orbit it could find. My balls didn't just ache, they fucking throbbed - almost seemed to blister with pain - so full of joyful juice that I wondered if I'd actually emptied anything into Kristen's quivering quim. The cascades of white, sticky substance leaking out of Krissy at that moment made it clear that I had, but it also made my agonizing need all the more inexplicable</p>
<p>I'd fucking unloaded for the third time that day and I was still wound up as fuck. Fuck. What the fuck was wrong with me? I grabbed a glass of ice and held it to my balls. I felt a little better for the moment. Then I took the opportunity to look around the room.</p>
<p>We'd drained the day down to its dregs. The ship was lit only by the moonlight. Kristen was still laying back on the table, dead to the world. I think I actually heard her snore for a second. Slain by my stupendous man-slime. Ashley just stood off to the side, agape, clearly coming down from who knows how many self-induced orgasms.</p>
<p>Emma sat next to her bestie, stroking Krissy's hair and, oddly, smiling. Why? And worse, why did that contentment seem so scary? But, incredibly, it wasn't the most frightening thing on the boat. That was Sam. He was on the far side of the room just... just fucking pacing back and forth. Swinging his fists like a gorilla at the zoo, face beet red, muttering and cursing up a storm.</p>
<p>"You fucked my girlfriend," Sam said, "Then you knew I wanted Kristen, so you fucked her too..."</p>
<p>"Come on, Sam, that's not..."</p>
<p>"Shut the fuck up," Sam snapped, "Just... just shut up, Jason. Shit."</p>
<p>"You're right, Sam, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"No you're... no you're fucking not. You're gonna fucking breed this whole boat before you're done, you fucking piece of... fuck. What the fuck, man?"</p>
<p>"You're right, Sam. I shouldn't have... I just... I'm sorry, man. I'm really fucking sorry."</p>
<p>"No," Sam said, he stopped pacing and walked over. Shook his finger in my face, "You're not sorry, not sorry enough. I'm gonna make you sorry, you sorry sack of shit."</p>
<p>Sam's anger was clearly playing keep away with his vocabulary. The whole time he spoke, his penis waved back and forth, making his threats seem kinda silly. Then he reached back like he was going to punch me and things got serious, fast.</p>

<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>I dodged and raised my hands, defensively. If he was gonna come at me, then... well he would kick my ass. Crew is nice for muscles but it doesn't make you into a martial artist. I was lousy at even making a fist, let alone throwing one. My ship was headed for rocky waters and shore was far, far away.</p>
<p>The girls leapt up and separated us. Emma holding me, Ashley on Sam.</p>
<p>"I'm... I'm not gonna hit him," Sam said, "I'm not. I lowered my hands, slowly. Ashley and Emma stepped back. Sam started talking again.</p>
<p>"Last night when you..."</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry Sam I..."</p>
<p>"Shut up! Last night when you fucked my... when you fucked Katie I was mad. So I came up with a plan to get you back. And then, when you were such a... a dick with Emma... I mean, come on man, she's your fucking sister, you can't just..."</p>
<p>"It's OK," Emma whispered, "I'm OK. It was... I was mad, but I... I know you were just trying to protect me, Jay Bird."</p>
<p>"He hurt you. And so we came up with a plan."</p>
<p>"Emma?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I was angry, Emma said, "Like I told you."</p>
<p>"I mean, I'd already figured the one part out," Sam said, "You took mine so I'd take yours. I knew you wanted Kristen so I figured I'd fuck her instead. Emma promised to help me out with that and in exchange I'd..."</p>
<p>He stopped talking. I looked at Emma, who shrugged. I kept waiting for Kristen to come at her best friend - angry at Emma for manipulating her out of her virginity. But either she was in on this from the start or too fucked out to care. Either reason, Kristen stayed silent.</p>
<p>"You know what?" Sam said, "Let's do this. Let's just fucking do it. I take it back, Jason, I won my fuck and I'm gonna take it now."</p>
<p>"Wait. Sam, you're gonna...?" I shied back.</p>
<p>"Go sit in the chair, Jason." Sam pointed at the blowjob chair, the one we'd all sat in for our oral adventures. "I won. You bet fuck and I won and now I'm gonna collect."</p>
<p>I looked at the girls for support, but they all stared back at me, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>"Sam, I don't want to..."</p>
<p>"Sit. In. The chair. Jason," Sam said.</p>
<p>I walked over to the chair and sat down, a naughty child in the corner. Sam stood over me like a gloating supervillain in a bad 80s cartoon. Only I'm pretty sure that the Cobra Commander never threatened to rape G.I. Joe.</p>
<p>"Emma wanted to get you and I told her I'd help out," Sam said, "That was the deal. She helps me with Kristen, I help her with you. So every time I ended up with Kristen, I pushed you to Emma. All those little kisses and feels. But you just wouldn't go forward fast enough. So I enlisted Ashley."</p>
<p>I looked over. The bouncy blonde smiled at me and waved. She said,</p>
<p>"It was a cruel thing you did, y'know. Not letting Emma touch anyone except you and then telling her you were the one person she couldn't have."</p>
<p>"I know," I said, "I..."</p>
<p>"So we set it up that Ashley would bet a dry hump and kinda... role play you into the mood," Sam said.</p>
<p>"When you raised it to a shower, I mean, I couldn't have asked for anything better," Ashley said, "I'm not gonna lie, it was a lot of fun to break you down like that. But you're still an asshole, Jason. Emma loves you too much to see it. But I do. Just so you know."</p>
<p>"And you were OK with all this?" I asked Emma.</p>
<p>"Kind of? Sort of. I mean, I thought I was, but then... I'm sorry Jason. I was angry and I wasn't thinking and..."</p>
<p>"OK, enough of this. Tie him up," Sam said.</p>
<p>I looked around the room. No one did anything.</p>
<p>"Seriously, I won my bet, tie Jason to the chair. Just his arms."</p>
<p>Ashley found some rope (We were on a boat, there was rope almost everywhere. A ship is basically the Best Buy of rope) and tied my arms behind the chair back. It hurt a good bit but at that moment, I didn't know what was going on.</p>
<p>I just couldn't get it out of my head that Sam had decided he was going to fuck me. Like, how was that revenge exactly and why did he want to do that and... I mean just the logistics of it all. I was sitting on a hard wooden chair. Sure my cock was sticking up from my lap, but how would that even work, like mechanically, unless he was gonna suck me off and... wait how the fuck would Sam get his revenge by sucking me off?</p>
<p>I struggled a bit to see if I could maybe slip out, but Ashley did a damn good job. She must have had a lot of practice somewhere tying knots. I doubt that it was on a boat.</p>
<p>Sam stood over me. It shouldn't have been so scary I mean, we were all naked. Like I said before, it's kinda hard to be threatening when your penis is just flopping around in front of you. I'm pretty sure that's why they invented pants in the first place, honestly. People were tired of looking so stupid.</p>
<p>But it wasn't stupid or silly. I was tied to the chair with everyone watching and Sam was screaming about how he was gonna get his fuck. It was fucking scary, man. It just was. My hard on shriveled.</p>
<p>Then Sam stepped aside, revealing my beautiful, bountiful baby sister, hands crossed demurely at her waist. My cock shot up stiffer than it had ever been.</p>
<p>There it was. Sam's plan. Brilliant, really. He didn't just take what I wanted, that was too banal. Instead, he forced me toward what I could never, ever have. Like giving a drunk a sip of whiskey or taking a gambling addict to the casino. Being with Emma now, like this... I'd never be able to build myself back up again.</p>
<p>But then, that's also where Sam's brilliant plan failed. Because I was still getting my Emma and damn the consequences. He thought he was forcing me into a lifelong regret. He'd given me the dream of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Emma. Standing almost primly. Bashful and angry and oh so fuckable all at the same time.</p>
<p>I traced her as she stood there. Emma's caramel-brown hair was still up in a tight ponytail. Her eyes, shining verdant. Eyebrows sharp, cheeks almost ruddy with arousal. Emma's lips, rosy and kissable, were turned up into a slight smile.</p>
<p>A little lower and her tiny tight tits stood proudly - nipples pink and pointing. Reaching. Her long, sculpted arms and delicate, dexterous hands. Fingernails painted baby chick yellow. Innocent, yet oh so certainly not.</p>
<p>I skipped down to the bottom, saving the best for last. Traversed Emma's cute, delectable toes. Followed her sculpted, athlete thighs - so strong, yet soft. Even the little flaws: the slightly knobby knees, her forearms just a little short for her build, her ears and nose maybe a bit too big. They made her all the more perfect.</p>
<p>Then, finally, her center. The bull's-eye of the unmissable target that was my Emma. Trimmed, barely there, brown, downy hair hung over her beautiful, full pussy. A flower slowly opening to bloom. Pink, full lips hung slightly open. The barest hint of clit, peeking from behind her curtains. Her vulva just below, waiting. Wanting.</p>
<p>And of course, she was dripping. Just absolutely leaking down her thighs. A shower of shiny little sister cum running in rivulets. Like she'd been dunked, bottom first.</p>
<p>"Hi," she said. She waved shyly.</p>
<p>I lied before. When I made that list and said that Ashley had the best breasts or Kristen had the best hair? I lied. There was only one winner, ever. Best eyes, best tits, best hands, best tongue, best legs, best snatch, best everything: Emma. My sister.</p>
<p>The only person I'd ever wanted. Yes, Kate was beautiful, Ashley so cute yet nasty, and Kristen was just lovely lovely lovely. But none of them, not one, was my Emma. The girl of my dreams. The one I'd fantasized over, and wondered about, and hoped for my whole life. Em, my little sis, who I knew I couldn't ever have but wanted bad enough to die for. That girl - that woman, that wish - stood over me now, naked and incomparable.</p>
<p>Emma stepped toward me. Unwilling to meet my eyes. She played her fingers through her arm hair, held her head down, and walked forward until our knees touched. Her stupendous small breasts were right at my eye level. Hypnotizing. I couldn't look away.</p>
<p>Emma's legs rubbed up against mine. My cock - standing in my lap, straight as a rail, thick and hard and eager - kind of pulsed, like waving a shy little hello to the woman of his dreams.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Jason," Emma said. But she didn't step away. She leaned forward. Ran her hands over my shoulders, my chest. Dragged her fingers over my taut nipples and teased my every nerve ending. She kissed me, lightly, then again, ever deeper, till our mouths were locked together, our tongues running over each other - mimicking the movements we both wanted to make with our bodies. My cock could not get any stiffer but it found a way, anyway.</p>
<p>Emma slowly slid forward, climbed onto the chair on her knees. Hung over me. She ran her fingers through my hair. I moved to reach up and touch her breasts, so pretty and perfect, but I just pulled at my ropes, instead. Impotent.</p>
<p>Emma mistook my movement.</p>
<p>"Shhhh... it's ok," she said, "I... We've... We waited so long for this, Jason. Don't tell me no. Trust me, OK, please. I've been right about it all so far. Just one last time. Let your little sister take care of you now. I promise I'll do a good job."</p>
<p>I nodded, nervous.</p>
<p>She ran her hand over my cheek, like to give me courage. Then she looked down at my pulsating penis. Shuddered and sighed.</p>
<p>"Shhhhh... Mom and Dad are asleep. I just want to come in here and... OH! There's that wonderful cock I've heard so much about."</p>
<p>She giggled a little.</p>
<p>"I've never held a real one, y'know, in my hand. Hey Ja... umm, big brother? Do you think I could... I mean, I know I'm your little sister and all but, well, would you let me touch it? Feel it? I promise that's all I'll do. I've only ever seen a penis before. Will you let me learn from you?"</p>
<p>I could only nod. Emma seemed to have something all thought out. All I could do was sit back and bounce between uncontrollable desire and inexplicable despair.</p>
<p>Emma reached down, then sort of corkscrewed her right hand around my cock. Her fingers were a little cool to the touch. Tentative.</p>
<p>"Ohhhhh that's... See that's so lovely. So hard and hot - soft and sticky. I wonder how it would feel inside my..."</p>
<p>She suddenly let go and my poor pendulous penis practically screamed in frustration.</p>
<p>"I know. You said just a touch. I'm a good little sister. I listen. You'll see."</p>
<p>"So good," I agreed.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose you'd let me... Well now that I've held a cock - Is that what you want me to call your stupendous stiffness Jay-bird? Not your thingy or your pee pee but your COCK? - Well once I've held him I'd kinda like to maybe try a little more? Would that be OK?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh."</p>
<p>"Like... maybe... show me how to stroke it? I won't make you like... shoot your stuff. I promise. I just want to know how to... to please a guy. My man. Y'know, down there."</p>
<p>It was enchanting, this mix of role play and reality. On the one hand, Emma had a whole fantasy going here, removed completely from where we were. But on the other... well, she wasn't making it all up either. Somehow, despite all that had gone on, she really hadn't held a cock except for that one moment when Ashley went down on her the day before. She certainly hadn't stroked one or had it in her... Ohhhh fuck.</p>
<p>Emma reached down and encircled my shaft again. Hardly moving her hand, just holding on. Needy. Like it was her life preserver in a sea of sexual unknowns</p>
<p>"Now how can you help me learn? Oh! I know. Just... y'know, like... Maybe, put your hands over mine and show me how you..."</p>
<p>She smiled, innocently, in a way that made it clear she was all but guilty.</p>
<p>Not thinking, again, I tried to pull my arms forward and show her. But I only succeeded in shaking us both on the chair.</p>
<p>"No?" Emma pouted, "Ohhhh... It's OK big brother. My little Jay Bird. Mom and Dad are in the next room, I know, but they won't hear us, I promise. You sure you don't want me to pull on your perfect peeny?"</p>
<p>I pulled against the chair again, a prisoner - frantic.</p>
<p>Emma released my cock and hung her hands behind her back. Then she stuck out her bottom lip, eyes to the ground. Made the sexiest little whimper.</p>
<p>"I know! I bet you're just uncomfortable. I can understand that. I mean... I'm your sister, right? Big brothers aren't supposed to show their little sisters their fantastic fertile cum."</p>
<p>Emma slid back a little. I could see behind her, Ashley and Sam were wrapped around each other, twisting tongues, Sam's hand on Ash's amazing breast. Yet somehow both of them also had their eyes on us, surreptitiously - the little show that was getting them going.</p>
<p>Kristen had stood up as well. She was closer. Within Emma's arm reach. The golden goddess seemed to be egging Em on, though I didn't hear her say a word.</p>
<p>"But Mommy always says to share and I'm a good little sis, remember? I promise to play nice with my big brother. So let's do a deal, OK?" Emma continued, "I'll show you how I cum, so then you can feel good about showing me yours. Fair?"</p>
<p>I nodded that it was, but Em wasn't waiting for permission. Instead she just slide her right hand down her belly. Then she slapped her clit.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she cried in concert with the CRACK of her slap.</p>
<p>"I've got a bad little clitty, wanting my brother so bad. But don't worry, she'll just put on a little show. Nothing... inappropriate."</p>
<p>This was a performance I had seen before, back as part of our group grind session at the beginning of the day. Even when Sam had brought my little sis off. But that didn't make it seem any less exciting. Best. Repeat. Ever.</p>
<p>Emma started being far, far nicer to herself. She groaned as she slid her hand slowly over her clit, tracing big circles. The circles grew smaller, tighter, faster. She bucked a bit.</p>
<p>"Aaaaaha!"</p>
<p>Then slid her whole hand over her pussy, rubbing back and forth as hard and fast as she could. Her legs trembled.</p>
<p>Breathing came in little gasps.</p>
<p>"See... big... brother... See how your... little sis... get's off? Bad... So bad. Big brother... You're not supposed... Supposed to see your sister cum..."</p>
<p>She tried to look me in the eye, but the sudden sensation of pleasure bent her sideways. Her eyes fluttered shut. Face contorted and tight. A long low groan. Her hips clenched and she shook.</p>
<p>"Th... there. There it is."</p>
<p>Then she straightened and smiled, the big post-cum happy face. She was still rubbing, though she slowed it down a bit so she could bend over and kiss me. Her lips pressed to mine. Passion.</p>
<p>"I... I have a confession," Emma said, so sweetly, "I didn't come in here just... just to feel your cock, JJ. I... wanted to... I want you. I've always wanted you. So bad... Will you... Will you make me yours, JJ? I swear I've never had a penis. I was... I was saving my needy, pleading puss just for you."</p>
<p>She sort of pointed down at her open snatch, still rubbing as she did so.</p>
<p>"See this? See how... how fucking wet I am for you? I promise Jay it's all only for you."</p>
<p>She took her hand off her clit and then dragged her fingers over my mouth. Let me taste her tremendous twat juice. It was honey. Nectar. I supped and sucked on her fingers like licking milk out of her teat. Oh...</p>
<p>"I know... I've been a bad little sis. Forcing... Holding you this way. But, JJ it was all for you. It's all... Only you. My body... Me. Made for you. I swear it's so. I know it. Please."</p>
<p>She reached down and started rubbing herself again, careful not to let more than the breeze of her movements brush my cock.</p>
<p>"See... see my cum? Is it good? Ohhhhhhh... Oh FUCK! Th... there. There it is... There..."</p>
<p>She sort of squirmed as she shook, her second orgasm in what seemed like seconds.</p>
<p>"Is that... did I do good for you, Jaybird?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I said, finally able to find my voice, "Good. So good."</p>
<p>Emma slowed her hand. Still panting. Sweat ran down her face and chest, mixing with the gallons of girl cum pooling on the inside of her thighs. We both stank like sex and we hadn't even fucked each other.</p>
<p>"Oh big bro. This is like, the best day ever! I'm so lucky to have a big brother looking out for me like this! Teaching me. And with Mom and Dad in the next room, too. So brave. I mean, one loud gasp and that would be the end..."</p>
<p>She sort of giggled, then minced about,</p>
<p>"Oh Daddy, don't worry. I didn't let him put his big mean thingy in me..."</p>
<p>Emma laughed again, her voice so musical.</p>
<p>"But you... you don't care one bit about that," she continued, "You just want to make your little sis so happy... Hang on. Next lesson!"</p>
<p>Emma stopped like she was getting a cell call. Then she slid down off the chair, knees on the floor.</p>
<p>"Oh, hello Jason penis. Big, amazing, unstoppable, completely fuckable new friend. I'm Jason's little sister, Emma - don't worry, you'll get to meet my own little private parts soon."</p>
<p>She patted him, lightly. It should have been a little silly, all this, but my cock certainly didn't think so and I could tell from the little moans and grunts in the background that Sam and Ashley didn't either.</p>
<p>"My little adventurer," she said, "You've been in... well, just about everyone's hand. I can't even count how many mouths. And two completely unprotected pussies! Did you like that? Spitting all your fertile seed into those poor women's wombs?"</p>
<p>I swear my penis bobbed right then. Nodded. A proud little 'yes.'</p>
<p>"I hope you saved enough for little sis..."</p>
<p>Emma shot forward and before I could see what was going on, she'd gobbled my cock head into her mouth. I practically seized right there on the chair, my head threw back, my legs shook. Emma swirled her tongue, dipped it into the hole, then licked her way up and down the shaft. She looked up at me, mouth full of cock, and smiled a big happy, double-chinned blowjob grin.</p>
<p>"I'm a good little sister," she told me, mouth full of cock.</p>
<p>Then she slowly let my shaft drag back out. It felt cold, going from the world of Emma's warm wetness into the open air.</p>
<p>"Yummy!" Emma cried, "Still kinda tastes like Krissy cum, though."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry..." Kristen started from somewhere to my right.</p>
<p>"Oh no, I like that. I like that a lot," Emma continued.</p>
<p>Kristen made a happy little gasp. I looked over and saw her for the first time fully since we'd... Her hair was all over the place. Her body slouched. Her hand - oh little Krissy, sweet innocent Krissy - her hand was jammed in her pussy. Rubbing languid. Loving what she saw in front of her.</p>
<p>Em climbed back up on the chair, covering my view once again.</p>
<p>"Oh big brother... you're so kind and generous - instructing your innocent little sis all about sex. Let's see..."</p>
<p>She put her finger on her chin, the cartoon definition of the thinking face. It was so ridiculous with her naked. So sexy.</p>
<p>"You let me touch your cock and then I showed you how I cum. Then you taught me about blowjobs, I'm such a lucky little girl. I guess there's only one thing left to learn then..."</p>
<p>"Emma..."</p>
<p>My conscience, somehow, had taken back over control. As if everything we'd done up till now was explicable, absolvable. Like if I could somehow escape the ultimate act and, in the morning, Emma would thank me for protecting her. Keeping her safe. Like a big brother should.</p>
<p>If she heard my judging tone, my little sister just ignored it. Instead she shuffled further up, then straightened her legs slightly. Aiming my arrow right at her exposed, vulnerable vulva.</p>
<p>"Jason," Emma said, "I thought we'd agreed on this. You said you'd show me... Show me everything. Your virgin little sister needs to learn these things, y'know. And like a good sister should, I'm gonna get my lesson from you. That's what big brothers are for, of course. To teach their little sisters everything."</p>
<p>"Emma I... I just don't want..."</p>
<p>She cocked her head at me. Curious.</p>
<p>"Do you want me?" she asked, lowering her pussy ever so slightly so it tickled the tip of my cock. The ultimate lie detector.</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>"...Yeah."</p>
<p>I didn't want to say it. Wanted to lie - only for her own sake of course. But it was too late. The truth was out and it'd be easier to delete a picture from the Internet than to pull back on what I'd said to my sister.</p>
<p>"I want you. So badly. I'm not lying JJ. I promise. Ask Krissy. All this time. I've been craving... Saving... saving myself for you. The love of my life. My big bro."</p>
<p>I turned and looked at Kristen, her face scrunched up and red like she was going to sneeze. Her hand slapping her clit so hard, I worried she might rip it out. She barely paused from her own pressings to nod, yes, Emma was telling the truth.</p>
<p>"I just... I just don't want to hurt you."</p>
<p>"Good," Emma said, "Then don't."</p>
<p>I thought she'd just impale herself right there, but instead she sat back a bit, like building up the courage. She blew her bangs out of her eyes.</p>
<p>"Fuck it," Emma said.</p>
<p>She reached back and pulled her hair out from the tie, letting her beautiful brown locks shake free. She tossed her head back, shook her hair like she was in a shampoo commercial. Then sat back up, hair dangling sexily over her eyes. Dripping down past her shoulders. I hadn't seen her hair down in... maybe ever. She went from Clark Kent to Superman. Extraordinary to stupendous.</p>
<p>I swear I gasped as her green eyes glowed at me through those dark brown strands.</p>
<p>"Oh, Em..." I sighed, happily, "You're so beautiful." I hadn't planned on saying it. It just... came out.</p>
<p>"Do you think so?" Emma asked, not really needy but still clearly enjoying the compliment.</p>
<p>"Yeah," I said.</p>
<p>"Not just cause I'm sitting here naked about to slam myself on your cock?"</p>
<p>"You're gonna...?" I asked. I don't know why I was so surprised. What did I think was happening, exactly? We weren't about to have high tea.</p>
<p>"Yeah." She said it the same way I always did. Mirrored my face, my intonation. Somehow that drove it all home. Siblings. Born from the same womb. Grown in the same house. The same childhood and now, suddenly, about to share the ultimate intimacy. So twisted, it only made me want her all the more.</p>
<p>Emma reached down and took my cock back into her hand. She lifted up on her thighs and then slowly dragged my penis over her open snatch.</p>
<p>"Em... You're... you're sure?"</p>
<p>I asked again, more to massage my own guilt over anything other than that. I was supposed to protect my baby sister's innocence. Not be the one to take it. Yet now, I knew, I would. I'd break through walls to bust her cherry.</p>
<p>"About our little final exam? Oh JJ. Jay-bird. More than anything," she said, still running my stiffness against her warm, wet softness.</p>
<p>"You're a virgin..."</p>
<p>"I know, Jason. Trust me."</p>
<p>"OK to hold him in my hand? Emma asked sweetly, already transgressing.</p>
<p>"OK to... to stroke him on my puss?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>She paused then, smiled down at me. Lined me up. Her wetness dripped over me already, like holding my cock under a running faucet.</p>
<p>"Put it in?" Emma asked. I looked at her, so beautiful. Incredible. I didn't deserve this. No one did.</p>
<p>"Plllleeeease let me put it in me," Emma begged, whimpered, "I want to feel it so badly! Oh God... I need... I need it. Need your cock so bad."</p>
<p>Her body shook with hunger as she pleaded.</p>
<p>"Yeah," I said, "Yeah. Put it in."</p>
<p>Emma lifted up even further, then set my penis right at the opening of her hungry hole.</p>
<p>"I'm fucking my brother," she said, almost curiously. Then she lowered herself, ever so slightly, onto the head. She went a little lower, taking only a bit of my head inside of her. Then she leapt up. I looked at her eyes, suddenly pale. Her confidence fleeing fast.</p>
<p>She went down a little more this time. Heaven. Her tight little hole around my whole head. She looked over at me. Smiled. Nervous. I waited for her to go lower, but she stopped in place instead.</p>
<p>"Oh... oh fuck..." Emma said.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, baby?"</p>
<p>"It's just... I mean... I know it's big, I said it's big but... Fuck. Look at it. How's all that going all the way in..." She looked down at her sex, already lewdly spread, "I mean my little pussy wants it all so bad, but I..."</p>
<p>I nodded. Understanding, of course.</p>
<p>"I... oh God. I think. I think it's too big, I mean..."</p>
<p>"It'll be OK, baby, I promise," I said.</p>
<p>"Sure you think that. You don't have to shove that immense snake monster inside your teeny tiny cave."</p>
<p>"Oh Emmy," I said. I tried to reach forward, stroke her arm, but I couldn't. Fuck, Ashley was far too good at tying. "You said it yourself. We're supposed to be together. That tight, wet, fucking tunnel of heaven was made for my cock. Remember? My penis is only big because my baby sister needs it so."</p>
<p>"I know but..." Emma went down to a whisper, "I'm afraid."</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ashley was at her side, looking like a naked nurse. She'd left Sam behind somewhere, I suppose, but I couldn't see him. Ash's lips and cheeks were red from all that kissing. Her incredible chest matched that color. I don't imagine they'd been fucking, but they must have been really fucking close.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, baby?" Ashley asked, her concern so obvious and true.</p>
<p>Emma looked near tears. Her perfect plan, punctured by my massive manhood.</p>
<p>"I... I want to... but... He's too big. I think he's too big."</p>
<p>Emma started to lift herself off me, but somehow Ashley held her there.</p>
<p>"How do you know that?" Ashley asked, "he's not even inside you, hun."</p>
<p>"It's just... I can already feel him streeeeetching me. I don't think I can go much... It's our first time together. I don't want... It has to be amazing or it won't work and then I'll... I'll lose the love of my life forever."</p>
<p>"Oh, honey. That's silly. The first time I fucked my br... I mean, the first time I had sex it hurt like fucking hell. Then we did it again and again and... like, he'd bought a ten pack of condoms just for that night, right? The next morning he had to run out to get more. We just kept going and going. And I'm telling you, each time?"</p>
<p>"Got a little better?"</p>
<p>"Fuck no, it hurt like hell," Ashley said, laughed. Smacked Emma on the shoulder. The hit alone made her slide down another centimeter.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Emma said. Not a good oh. She tried to push herself back up.</p>
<p>"But eventually, over time, we learned how to make it feel good for me. Amazing. Which only made it all even better for him. And you know what? Your brother may be an unforgivable ass, but I know for a fact that Jason will do anything he can to make the sex fucking incredible for you. So don't worry."</p>
<p>Emma nodded, still worried.</p>
<p>"Well, OK... What if I helped you, you know? For your first time."</p>
<p>Emma looked at Ash, confused by what was being offered.</p>
<p>"Y'know? I can help you slide down, hold you. Jason could probably do those things if he wasn't... tied up with other things at the moment."</p>
<p>"You could untie me," I said.</p>
<p>"Oh no. You're not going anywhere. Not till you've gotten your full punishment. I know you Jason, maybe you won't escape right away, but you're still looking for a way out of this. To be what you thinks of as the good brother, which honestly, is the opposite of what you've actually been doing these last few days. Trust me. This is for your own good. And Emma's too."</p>
<p>I slumped back and sighed.</p>
<p>"So does that sound good? You want me to put that practically perfect penis in you?"</p>
<p>I heard Sam groan in frustration from somewhere in the cabin.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Mr. Whiny, you'll be putting plenty inside me soon!" Ashley said. Chastising.</p>
<p>Emma looked at me, nervous, then shook her head slightly. No. Still afraid. Ashley sighed in exasperation.</p>
<p>"What if you let Kristen do it. Would that work for you?"</p>
<p>Emma paused, then nodded. Emphatic.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Yeah, OK."</p>
<p>"You helped Krissy get off," Ashley said, "so let her help you. Yeah. That works right?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh."</p>
<p>Kristen came over, looking a little scared. Ashley whispered into Kristen's ear. The beautiful blonde nodded.</p>
<p>Then, with the seriousness of a professional, Kristen leaned over and kissed Emma full on the lips. She pulled my baby sister into a tight embrace. Their breasts rubbed against each other. I wish I could've saved that sight forever.</p>
<p>Kristen slowly took her right hand away from her best friend's face and slid it down. I felt her fist around my cock.</p>
<p>"Ohhh... Holy crap, Kristen!" I cried.</p>
<p>"It's OK," Kristen whispered, to both me and Emma, "It's OK. Just like what we talked about, right? You stuffed me. So now I get to fill you."</p>
<p>Kristen's fist tight around my root, she sort of leaned forward, pressing her weight into Emma's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Oh..." Emma said, absently.</p>
<p>I felt her pussy slowly lower on me. Emma'd made it seem like I'd be battering down her walls, but instead we slid so easy... Swimming through her moat - her lubrication so incredible. It was mental, then, Emma's worry. I understood that.</p>
<p>Her pussy inched it's way about a quarter of the way down my shaft.</p>
<p>"OK, honey," Kristen said, "Virginity time. Big push."</p>
<p>She removed her hand from my cock, no longer worried about it slipping out. Then she sort of walked it up to Kristen's sloppy center. I didn't need to see it - I could hear and feel just fine: Kristen started rubbing Emma's clitoris.</p>
<p>"Ohhhhhhhhh..." Emma sighed, "Krissy you... you're so good at that. Why the fuck did we not do this before?"</p>
<p>Kristen kind of laughed.</p>
<p>"Rub each other off?"</p>
<p>"All... all of it."</p>
<p>Kristen kept Jilling my little Emma. Her body shook, straightened.</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh fffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuck!" Emma cried. And in that moment, as her body snapped into climax, Kristen shoved Emma right down my shaft.</p>
<p>"OH FUCK!" I cried. We cried. Chorused in one voice. Brother and sister. Finally joined.</p>
<p>Kristen gave her bestie a bit squeeze to stop her shaking, then slowly let her go. Emma looked down at where our bodies met. My penis bulging in her pubis. Her greedy nether mouth suctioned to my base. My balls up against her tight, athletic ass.</p>
<p>"That's... that's it!" Emma said, "He's all the way... Fuck! I barely even felt that."</p>
<p>"Gee, thanks, sis."</p>
<p>"Oh don't be such a baby, big brother. Trust me." She gave my shaft a little squeeze for emphasis. "I feel that massive tool in me just fine."</p>
<p>Emma sort of lifted herself off, an engineer checking that our connection was secure. As she did I saw my own pubes were wet with Emma's amazing girl-juices and spattered red. Her virginal blood.</p>
<p>"Oh... Oh Em, I'm sorry," I said, reflexively."</p>
<p>"For what...?"</p>
<p>"I... I took your virginity. Oh fuck..."</p>
<p>"Oh don't be stupid, silly. I GAVE you my virginity. It's all yours. Just like this pussy, these tits. My mouth... my ass... Yours forever. Well, and maybe Krissy's a bit, too. But don't worry big bro, I know that we can share."</p>
<p>Emma looked lovingly over at her friend, the tall blonde watched us like the bridesmaid at a wedding. Wistful and proud.</p>
<p>Satisfied that all was well and sealed, Emma lowered herself again. I was finally buried to the hilt inside her slippery sheath. She kind of wiggled herself, getting used to the sensation. She turned to Ashley, still watching on.</p>
<p>"I'm fucking my brother," Emma told her.</p>
<p>"Sssssssoooo hot," Ashley said.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Kristen agreed.</p>
<p>Emma sort of leaned forward. Dragged her nipples over my chest - scraped like sharp nails.</p>
<p>"You're inside your little sister," she told me, "The one place you should never be. The one place your perfect penis belongs. Nothing between us. Just your cock and my pussy. Skin to skin."</p>
<p>Suddenly it hit me.</p>
<p>"Oh shit... Emma. You're on the pill, right?"</p>
<p>She looked at me, dubious. Then giggled her little girl laugh.</p>
<p>"Nuh-uh," Emma said.</p>
<p>I started to lean forward. To try to push her off. I mean, come on. Fucking was one thing but... My ropes held me tight.</p>
<p>"See Jason," Ashley said, "What did I say? Those ropes are there for your own protection."</p>
<p>I glared over at her. She wasn't the one who'd be carrying her big brother's baby.</p>
<p>"Let's just..." I started to speak. Rationalizing. To me or my sister I'm not at all sure. "I mean. It's in now. Let me go... I'll get a condom and..."</p>
<p>Emma answered by rising up slightly, teasing, then sliding right back down. Encasing me again in my her hungry hole. I groaned and my mind went blank. Total reboot. One little movement - not even a full-fledged pump in and out - and little Emma was already the best fuck I'd ever felt.</p>
<p>I tried talking again. Only God knows why.</p>
<p>"When I'm close I'll... I'll tell you and you'll get off. You'll come so many times before I go, I promise. Then you can jack my seed on your fucking fantastic tits. Your face. Drink it all down. Whatever you wish, little sis."</p>
<p>"Hmmmm. That does sound nice, but... NOPE!" Naughty little sister.</p>
<p>"OK... I'll... I'll pull out. I'll find a way."</p>
<p>"Don't. You. Dare," Emma said. Glared. "I'm fucking my brother. And I'm not ever gonna stop."</p>
<p>She wrapped her athletic thighs tight around my own legs. Those fucking pile drivers. Her arms were well defined in a totally feminine way. Her stomach - flat, tight. Then Emma leaned back so I could stare in awe at her tiny, perfect titties. She started tracing my nipples with her baby-yellow nails.</p>
<p>"This right here?" She looked down at my cock. "This is mine. I fucking earned it. And you're gonna give me everything I deserve. Your head, your shaft, your fertile, fantastic cum."</p>
<p>Very slowly she started to raise herself up on my cock. Her powerful legs put her in total control. She got about halfway up, grinning like a maniac.</p>
<p>"Mine!" Emma cried, like a kid taking a toy. Then she just... fucking... dropped.</p>
<p>"Aaaaaahhhaaa!" she cried. She threw her head back but I could see the tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Ssssssssoooooo. Fucking GOOD!" Emma lifted up, slammed home. Painfully gentle in the one direction, orgasmically hard in the other.</p>
<p>"I'm fucking fucking my fucking brother!" she cried, loud enough for the Coast Guard to be aware. She lifted herself up again.</p>
<p>"So big. So... so much cock to stuff into your baby sis."</p>
<p>She hit bottom with a little 'oh' then leaned forward and kissed me, hard.</p>
<p>"It's all in there, see?" She pointed at where our bodies met. "I made it all gone."</p>
<p>I laughed a little.</p>
<p>"See that? All in. I'm a good girl. Got it past my hymen and everything. And I'm already... I'm already cumming. So much big brother cock and it's all in there. In me. In your teeny tiny sister. Didn't Krissy do a good job?"</p>
<p>"Yuh huh."</p>
<p>"And what about me? Your little sis?"</p>
<p>"Amazing. The best."</p>
<p>"See? And I even gave you a little girl cum already. Don't I deserve your powerful... potent... treat?"</p>
<p>She had been so scared. Now? Suddenly so confident. It was cute.</p>
<p>Emma leaned down and hugged me tight. I wanted to hug her back but couldn't. I pulled so hard my arms felt ready to snap. I felt blood on my wrists. The rope gave, just a little bit. Not nearly enough.</p>
<p>Emma's sweet face suddenly went away and she grinned at me, almost frightening in her desire. She raised her body up with her knees, her arms on my arms - almost on all fours above me. Her body pistoned on my penis, like doing push ups. Up and down. Up and down. A slow, teasing rhythm that I knew was only a test run. This wasn't even close to full speed and Emma, the girl who lettered in cross country, was gonna take her time in going there.</p>
<p>She hit bottom again. My balls bounced against her perfect butt cheeks. Oh, I couldn't wait to squeeze that ass while she rode me. To jam my thumb into her only remaining virgin hole and drive her into the floor as she cried in pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>No, my conscience said. No. This one time is OK because she forced you but... You shouldn't. You mustn't. So long as it's forced, though, that's OK. I smiled, ruefully, my ethics already cracking apart.</p>
<p>Emma smiled back down at me.</p>
<p>"I'm fucking my brother," she told me.</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"It's fucking fantastic," Emma said. She wasn't fucking kidding. Kate's pussy was amazing but I wouldn't even look at it again after having Emma's. Kristen had the tightest snatch I'd ever felt, a boa constrictor of a cunt - it was nothing compared to this. Like a Honda Civic next to a Ferrari.</p>
<p>Emma went up my shaft then down again.</p>
<p>I'm gonna tell you a secret. Something I've found out in all the time I've been fucking. When you read a story like this, it's all about how tight the girl's pussy is. And tight is great, no doubt. But the best pussy you will ever fuck will be lubricated to all hell and that, I promise you, is all that matters.</p>
<p>Tighter than tight but dry? Hurts like hell. But wet? That's the fucking magic, man. The wetter the better. And my sister wasn't lubricating so much as pissing all over me. Her electrifying, oh-so-slippery liquid love. We could bottle it and sell it. She certainly made more than enough.</p>
<p>My penis, our legs, her hands, it was all fucking covered in Emma's juice and if I thought she'd reached her full potential I was so so so so wrong. With every thrust she dripped all the more over us.</p>
<p>And she was starting to thrust. To pump. To pop up and back in pleasure-filled pushes. Driving. Riding. Dragging up and slamming down. And at the end of each long journey, she'd gasp, shaking her incredible hair in exquisite pleasure. Her drooling pussy dripped everywhere as it milked my shaft.</p>
<p>As she bounced, I did everything I could to wrap my tongue around her precious nips. I caught a little bit with my tongue, but she was playing keep-away, bopping up and down on my cock.</p>
<p>"Em..." I begged, "Your breasts... please... I want... Want them so badly..."</p>
<p>Emma slowed for a second, sort of sat up.</p>
<p>"You like my breasts? Emma asked, clutching them to her chest. All little girl.</p>
<p>"They're the best in the world," I said, not caring if the other girls heard.</p>
<p>"I always thought they were too small."</p>
<p>"Nope," I said, "Perfect."</p>
<p>She beamed bright red, then. Beautiful. Then she leaned forward and dangled those amazing titties right over my mouth. I pulled, happy, at her nipple. Tasting, testing. I took little nibbles at her pinkest perfection and licked and suckled at my sister's amazing, long nips. It was my life force and I suckled at it, ecstatic. Fuck whatever I'd said before. Here was the world's most perfect breast and I worshipped it, a starving man desperate for sustenance.</p>
<p>Smack. Slllllurp.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, Emma pulled away, leaned back. I looked up at her, surprised.</p>
<p>"You're such an amazingly good big brother. I'm so lucky to... Hey, wanna see a cool trick?"</p>
<p>I couldn't help but laugh a little.</p>
<p>"Check this out," Emma said, "Been practicing."</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt her pussy grrrrrriiiiiiip my cock. Not like a pussy at all. Like a mouth, clamping down on a carrot stick. Sucking and kneading for all it was worth. It was so good, so amazing, I went blind. I was seeing stars. The whole world collapsed down to the point where her quim closed around my cock.</p>
<p>Somehow, my sister had found a way to combine all the pressure and fine control of a blowjob with the wonderful, tight wetness that made a pussy so incredible. Extraordinary. You couldn't design something to feel any better. Holy fuck. My sister was a fuck goddess.</p>
<p>"Uh huh?" Emma asked.</p>
<p>I looked up, dazed. She did it again. I heard someone howling in ecstasy. I realized it was me. My voice.</p>
<p>"Kegels," Emma said, "Been practicing every day since... Well long time."</p>
<p>God DAMN. That little workout warrior had built up everything on her, including her incredible cunt.</p>
<p>Emma did her little trick a third time and my brain suddenly shot to red alert. My cock couldn't take any more. It was gonna fire. There was so much cum in me, I could feel it backed up to my ribs. I was gonna... I could fucking fill a party balloon with everything about to shoot out of me. I'd blast my baby sis right off my cock like she was riding a cannon. She'd be having babies for life, just from that one ejaculation and it... it was coming. Soon. Now...</p>

<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>Babies... Oh fuck...</p>
<p>She let her pussy muscles relax. Stayed perfectly still, as if she knew what she'd almost caused. I felt everything go back, just a bit. Explosion still imminent, just not as much as before.</p>
<p>Clearly all that squeezing had done something incredible for Emma, as well. She was panting hard, her hair stuck to her forehead with sweat. Her chest hot pink with her arousal. Her eyes crinkled with concern.</p>
<p>"Did I hurt you, baby?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No. No no. Quite the opposite. I... I almost..."</p>
<p>"Oh," she said, "Well that's OK. You can cum whenever you want, OK?"</p>
<p>"But... but Eeeemmmmmmaaa..." I whined.</p>
<p>"Tell me. Tell me what you're doing right now."</p>
<p>"I'm fucking my sister," I told her.</p>
<p>"Well, really your sister is fucking you."</p>
<p>"She is."</p>
<p>"You like it?"</p>
<p>"Love it."</p>
<p>"Sssssoooo...So show me. Show me how much you love me. Let your little sis know what a good job she's doing."</p>
<p>I looked up, slightly afraid of what that meant. There was nothing between us now. Nothing but the promise of my sperm. Her egg. The oncoming hard, physical evidence of our one-ness.</p>
<p>"I..." she started. Then stopped.</p>
<p>"I love you Emma," I told her, "More than anything. More than life itself. OK? I love you little sis. From the beginning of us to forever."</p>
<p>Emma smiled so hard I thought she'd break. She sat up, adjusting my cock inside her till it was pole-straight. Then she began to ride me. Hard. Hands on my shoulders. Eyes closed.</p>
<p>"Uhhhhhnnnnn..."</p>
<p>She kept going. Pulled her legs up till she was back in that all-fours position. Started to ride my cock like an animal on the carousel pole. Just up and down and up and down, circles around forever. And with every drop, her pussy showered me with its adulation.</p>
<p>Her pubic bone bounced into me. Punched. Almost painful. One hand drifted down to her clitty. The other kind of caressed my neck. Rhythmic</p>
<p>"Uhn. Uhn. Uhn."</p>
<p>It was a pace for her alone. I couldn't... somehow all that speed slowed me down. It was her ride. Her fuck. Not for me. I pulled at the restraints behind me. Desperate to hold her hips. Hang on...</p>
<p>"I think I might..." Emma started. Her eyes suddenly open.</p>
<p>"I mean, I already did but... But not like this. Oh... OH fuck! I mean... I thought I'd... Wha... what's happening to... AH!" She gasped, froze in mid stroke. Her body shook, seized, almost imitating how Ashley came. Emma's hand still rubbed slightly at her clitoris. Her tiny tits, so game, did their absolute best to shake.</p>
<p>And then she howled. Screamed.</p>
<p>"fffffffFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUCK!"</p>
<p>GASP</p>
<p>"Ohhhhhhh ffffffFFFFFFFUCK MEEEEE!"</p>
<p>I heard it before I saw it. A fucking glob of clear liquid burst from Emma's pussy, splashing my legs and chest. Like someone'd burst a water balloon over us. It smelled like cinnamon and incense. Reeked of my sister's sweat, her pussy. The aroma of home.</p>
<p>Her hips bucked.</p>
<p>Another little spurt. Another. Another.</p>
<p>She bucked again. One last little spit.</p>
<p>"Ha!" Emma cried, "Ah ha ha ha HA!"</p>
<p>She slid down my cock again. I had no idea how she stayed on me through all that.</p>
<p>"That was..." She leaned forward. Put her head on my shoulder. All the girl cum squished between us. Rubbing onto her breasts and stomach. We were both sticky with it now, Emma's precious squirt.</p>
<p>"I mean... I've never..." She seemed almost bashful, her hands holding me close like I might ever try to escape.</p>
<p>"It was amazing," I told her.</p>
<p>She looked up at me, eyes wet. Emma laughed a little, then came, then kept laughing.</p>
<p>"I didn't know I could do that," she said.</p>
<p>"Me either," I said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well..."</p>
<p>"You're gonna do it again."</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"You damn well better."</p>
<p>Emma heard what I was promising. She cooed, still impaled on my cock. As she nuzzled closer, I pulled her close and...</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>I looked at my hands on either side of us.</p>
<p>"Jason?" Emma asked.</p>
<p>I just stared at my arms, suddenly unsecured. Little remains of the rope hung off my wrists. At some point when Emma was coming we must have...</p>
<p>The moment froze. Emma shifted, tossing her hair in slow motion. Maybe she said something to me. I couldn't hear. All I got was the voice in my head, the one saying 'No. Stop.'</p>
<p>All my life, any time I'd wanted anything. I'd heard that voice. Be the good guy, it said. Do the right thing. Then, finally, I'd ignored it all weekend. And I thought, wow, I screwed everything up.</p>
<p>I looked up at my beautiful sister, her eyebrow slightly arched, and realized how wrong I was. I smiled then. Truly happy. Maybe for the first time in my life.</p>
<p>"Jason?" Emma asked again.</p>
<p>My hands shot out and grabbed her muscular buttocks. Then I leapt forward, throwing my cock into my baby sister with all my strength. Emma squealed in surprise.</p>
<p>Suddenly I felt my backside tipping. The chair, tilting forward with our momentum. We hit the ground with a crash. Tumbled to the floor. Emma's amazing body broke my fall. Somehow, miraculously, we stayed right on top of each other, my cock still buried in my baby sis' steaming cunt.</p>
<p>She looked up at me. Her eyes searching.</p>
<p>I pulled back. Slow.</p>
<p>"Jaaaason," Emma whined, "Pleeease."</p>
<p>I moved back a bit further. Only my head was in her pussy now.</p>
<p>"Oh no..." Emma said.</p>
<p>Then like a pile driver, I drove into my sister. Slammed into her so hard she almost bounced.</p>
<p>"Ohhhhh YES!"</p>
<p>Thump. Thump. Thump. Driving her. Again and again. Anger and love and desire all pounding into Emma for all I was worth. The pleasure absolutely exploded like fireworks all over my body. Eyes screwed up with so much bliss.</p>
<p>"Oh... Oh... oh... Jason. JJ..." Emma's every cry announced my cock had bottomed out, beating against her cervix.</p>
<p>I started pushing her along the carpet. A burning slide across the cabin. Emma held on to me for dear life. Mewling and whimpering the whole way.</p>
<p>I felt one of Emma's arms let go of me. I slowed. Looked over. Kristen. We were so into it, I hadn't seen her there. Lying next to us. A look of so much love and awe. The big-breasted blonde had her one hand on her puss. The other outstretched, fingers intertwined with her beloved little Emmy.</p>
<p>I smiled at Kristen then slowed, using long, languid strokes. Savoring every bit of banging my baby sister.</p>
<p>"My brother... He's fucking..." Emma said to Kristen. She said it so proudly. Like bringing a medal home from school. "He's fucking me and he... He's not gonna stop."</p>
<p>Kristen suddenly smiled a wicked little smile.</p>
<p>"You're not on birth control?" she asked. Emma shook her head, no. Her eyes looked small and scared. I couldn't tell if she was playing now or not.</p>
<p>Kristen continued, cruel beauty.</p>
<p>"But you're in the safe part of your cycle, right? Rhythm method? All that?"</p>
<p>"I... Oh God," Emma jutted back and forth with the pressure of my pounding, "I think our cycles... like, y'know? We're all matched up? I'm like... so fucking fertile right now it's... Maybe... Maybe that's why I've been this way all weekend. It's my body... It's just begging some boy parts to put me with a baby."</p>
<p>Kristen looked at me now, clearly enjoying her little turnabout.</p>
<p>"Now you listen to me Jason. You hearing me?"</p>
<p>I looked up, still stroking Emma's engine up to life.</p>
<p>"You stay inside her, Jason." She kind of crossed her free arm over her chest. Stared me down, "Don't you dare pull out. When you start to feel like you're gonna cum, you slam inside her and stay until it's all gone. I don't know why that's so hard for you boys, but..."</p>
<p>I nodded. That girl had her dirty talk down.</p>
<p>"I'm serious, Jason," Kristen continued, "I don't care what you think you ought to do. If you waste even one of those precious, potent brother-spermies on Emmy's back, her beautiful face, or on those gorgeous, perfect tits and I'll take my fucking revenge. Not in her stomach. Not up her ass. In. Her. WOMB. You hear me?"</p>
<p>She kept my gaze, then looked back down at Emma, now clearly twisting the knife on her tiny, brunette best friend</p>
<p>"Ohhhhh Emma. Your brother... Jason... Our little Jay Bird. He's not wearing a condom or anything at all. And you...? Oh Emmy, he's gonna shoot you full of his stuff and get you... GASP! Get you pregnant with his big bro baby."</p>
<p>"I... I know," Emma said, "My brother's gonna make me a Mommy."</p>
<p>"Sssssssoooooo wrong," Kristen said, then she let her hand drift down to her steaming snatch and started rubbing for all she was worth. Now that she'd figured out the secret recipe to her own orgasm, that girl was gonna baking herself silly every moment she could.</p>
<p>"Sssssssoooooooo right," Emma agreed, her back arched like she trying to toss her tiny, tremendous tits off her chest with each of my aching thrusts.</p>
<p>I found a little hitch. I'd draw back, push up, then follow through. And everytime I did that little pause, Emma gasped for air like she was drowning. I loved that sound so much - fuck, it'd be my ringtone if I could get her to agree to it. Draw, hitch, drive. Draw, hitch drive. Emma was holding onto me even harder now. I felt her nails break the skin of my back, my thighs, my ass. Just as I was breaking her with my big, powerful plunges.</p>
<p>I heard a thump next to us. Ashley, followed quickly by Sam. Her hands wrapped around his cock. His lips pressed to the hollow of her neck. She winked at me.</p>
<p>I responded with another little hitch and drive into my little sis' pussy.</p>
<p>There was silence then, sort of. The boat filled with the sounds of fucking. The little squelches of a penis punishing a pussy. The wet squishes of fingers rapidly running over a clit. Little hmmms and ahs. Grunts and gasps.</p>
<p>"Emma," Ashley whined. I looked over, surprised to see the both of them still intertwined right next to us. Sam and Ashley, they could easily have been the hottest thing going on for nautical miles. Instead I was so focused on plunging my darling Emma, I'd almost forgotten they were there. Ashley kept talking,</p>
<p>"Eeeemmmmm. Sammy keeps trying to put his thing inside me."</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Emma said, sliding back and forth with my thrusts like she was strapped on some strange rowing machine, "Good. Sam, you shove your cock inside that whore's hairy twat and stuff her full of sperm."</p>
<p>Ashley laughed, an arpeggio.</p>
<p>"You... you heard her, Sam Sam. Time to be a good little boy and give me my punishment."</p>
<p>To his credit, Sam sat up and asked,</p>
<p>"Condom?"</p>
<p>"Oh please," Ashley broke character, "Unlike all these other stupid sluts I'm on the pill."</p>
<p>I heard a loud squelching sound. Then,</p>
<p>"ohhhhhh FUCK!" Ashley cried, "That's... oh Sammy... so good."</p>
<p>I paused to look over and there she was, on her back, legs splayed up to her shoulders. Sam absolutely plowing into her. Like animals. Like Emma and me.</p>
<p>"Ssssssssso. So. Good." Ashley gasped. Her head tossed back and forth. Curls sproinging against the thin carpet.</p>
<p>Almost unconsciously, I matched our partners' pace. Faster, harder, faster still. Emma's tiny breasts did everything they could to jiggle, those incredible overachievers. My balls bounced against her backside.. Slap. Slap. Slap. Faster.</p>
<p>"Oh, Fuck Oh. Oh Em. So good. You... you're pussy feels so good. Oh Em, Oh Emmy, Oh little baby Emmy I'm..."</p>
<p>Emma hugged me close. Pressed her chest into mine. Held me still.</p>
<p>"Oh!" She cried, "I can feel it. I can feel it... I'm gonna... oh... just a little one..."</p>
<p>Emma's arms and legs tightened, shuddered then loosened again. Let me start moving again.</p>
<p>No squirting this time, but a hard cum all the same, I could tell by how Emma's cunt clutched at me cock - the same way she was squeezing me so tight to her, I couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>"Oh...oh Em. You... came again? You came for me?"</p>
<p>"Oh. Oh yeah. Only for you."</p>
<p>She kissed me, hard. I tried to stick with her but my movements ripped us apart and I hardly cared.</p>
<p>"Oh... oh good. So good," Emma said. She looked over at Ashley, the horny girl getting her own hard pounding from Sam, and said "I... I'm... I... oh gawwwwd... I'm fucking my... my brother... Ash, I... So good..."</p>
<p>"I know baby," Ashley said, "So hot... wa... watching you. I'm sorry I... I'm ssssoooo close I... I'm gonna cum soon. Sammy's... Little Sammy's inside me and I can feel it... he's about to give me his seed and... OH! Oh, I need it so bad, Sammy. I need to cum and I need you to get me there. Please just... Sammy please fill ME!"</p>
<p>Ashley's hand shot out, grabbing Emma's own. Squeezing so hard, Emma's palm went purple.</p>
<p>"Help me... Oh Emma... Help me CUM. Oh, fuck! Little Emmy cum with me, OK? I need you to cum with me...ohhhhh... Here it comes..."</p>
<p>Sam buried his face in Ashley's bosom. He grunted. We saw Ashley's familiar o-face overcome her. Her body stiffened, shook, breasts bouncing in time with what must have been his explosions inside of her.</p>
<p>As Ashley climaxed, Emma started to shake on her own, like the little blonde had somehow passed hers on to my sister in a strange, smooth circuit.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Emma cried, her body bucked "Oh...that... That was a big one..."</p>
<p>Ashley smiled and licked her lips. Satiated. Sam rolled off her with a sigh. He rested his head back in his hands. Stared up at the ceiling. Not Ashley though. She watched, transfixed, as I took my sister further than either of us could ever have imagined.</p>
<p>"It's so much better," Ashley said to no one. To the room. "Feeling their cum shoot off inside you. The warm, fertility just showering my cervix. And... I swear... it's like my body knows I'm on the pill. Like, somehow, it's just that little bit less good."</p>
<p>"Hmmmmm..." Emma sighed, like savoring what she was about to see for herself.</p>
<p>"So jealous," Ashley said.</p>
<p>All that talk about unprotected sex... It should have scared me. Instead my balls just tightened. Like Ashley's little sermon was somehow coaxing the cum out of me.</p>
<p>I slowed. Scared.</p>
<p>"You... you getting close?" Emma asked, her voice tremulous.</p>
<p>"... Yeah," I said. I wanted to lie. To stay in her forever. But I couldn't. Not now. We were covered in her juices and I was just aching to fill her up with mine.</p>
<p>"It's OK," she said, writhing, trying to start me pumping her again, "Cum."</p>
<p>"But Emma, we're..."</p>
<p>My sister sighed, exasperated. The way she used to when she tried to explain my calculus homework to me. Us sitting in her perfectly pink bedroom under the poster of Mia Hamm. Her wearing just a t-shirt and short shorts that seemed to somehow cover less than a pair of panties. Me, struggling to focus. And she'd sigh. Just like that.</p>
<p>"You're bareback in my pussy," Emma said, "I'm not on the pill."</p>
<p>"I... I know..."</p>
<p>"You're gonna cum in me," Emma told me, "You're gonna give me all your potent big brother stuff. You are gonna knock... me... up..."</p>
<p>Slowly, almost despite myself, I pictured her belly round with my baby. I started moving again, slowly. Dragging it out. Alllllll the way to the ridge below my sensitive head. Then back down to my balls.</p>
<p>"And then you're gonna do it again."</p>
<p>"I... I'm... I mean..."</p>
<p>"Tell me Jason. Tell you want to stop right now. Beg me, brother, beg me and I will. I'll let..."</p>
<p>She suddenly shuddered, eyes shut, neck taut. Another orgasm ripping through her.</p>
<p>"How... how was that?" she asked, suddenly small. Her eyes searched mine.</p>
<p>"Your pussy is... so good. So tight. I'm so proud of you. You're doing sssoooo good."</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"I'm trying... trying so hard to be good for you. Oh Jason, my cum... I want my cum to be so good. Just for you. Make you proud. Can I? Can your little baby sis' little cums make you proud?"</p>
<p>"Oh... Oh GOD yeah."</p>
<p>"So... so show me."</p>
<p>"I don't..."</p>
<p>"Yes you do. There's only one thing you can do to show me what a good little girl I can be for you. Please Jason. Please..."</p>
<p>"And if I..."</p>
<p>"You will," Emma said, "I promise. You'll put your big brother spermies inside my womb and make me...ohhhhh... make me pregnant. Just like Krissy. My pussy will drip your semen for days and I'll know my brother loves me. My cervix will just be splattered with cum and I'll cry... beg... beg you to stuff me all over again. You want that, baby? You want to fill your baby sister up with all that baby batter? That amazing joyful juice I'm craving oh, oh so bad. Will you give it to me, baby?"</p>
<p>I stopped then. Suddenly. Rested on my elbows over her. Her pussy squeezed me. Just slightly. I almost collapsed with pleasure.</p>
<p>Last chance, my conscience said.</p>
<p>Fuck you, I replied.</p>
<p>I leaned in and let our noses touch.</p>
<p>"I'm not your baby," I said to her, angrily, "Don't call me your baby. You're MY baby. My baby sis. And I'm your brother. Your BIG brother."</p>
<p>"Oh...ssssoooo... So big. Too big. Remember? You broke it, big brother. You broke my pussy with your big, thick, stick... Oh...Oh yes... You... you getting close, big brother? Extra major totally huge magically membered big brother?"</p>
<p>"Emma, I..."</p>
<p>I felt something wet on my ear. Kristen, sucking on my lobe like it was a full, ripe tit. Then she stopped and whispered.</p>
<p>"Do it. Knock her up."</p>
<p>I felt her hand on my butt cheek, massaging for moral support. God bless that no-longer innocent minx. I slowly reared back. Then I felt Kristen shove me forward, my sister skewered on my stiffness. Right up against her cervix and through. As if she somehow knew, Kristen cheered.</p>
<p>"OH! Oh that is so good..." Emma said. I smiled up at her, knowing the point of no return was near.</p>
<p>I pressed my lips to Emma's, savoring our increased depth. So part of each other now - almost inseparable. When we pulled apart I looked her right in her bright green eyes.</p>
<p>"Em... Little Emmy... Oh... oh fuck I'm so close. I need to come. Please. Please I need to come."</p>
<p>"I know... Oh... I know big brother. Oh, you need your little sis to take care of you, I know. Ohhhhh... But you... you have to... Ohhhhhh. Oh GOD."</p>
<p>"Please Em. Please Emmy... Whatever I did whatever I said I was wrong and I need you. I neeeeeed you to take my cum. Please. Just let... let me come in you..."</p>
<p>"But Jason," Emma said, "You can't come in your little sister. What would Mommy and Daddy say if I came home full of your potent pearly goo?"</p>
<p>"Em... Emma..."</p>
<p>"Oh Daddy, Jason did it. He stuck his big, naughty pee pee in me. He forced it in my tight, hot hole. Broke my poor hungry pussy in two with his... his thing. Wouldn't let me go until he loaded me up with his... his nasty, goopy... stuff."</p>
<p>"I don't... I don't care. I... Ohhhhhh Emma I need you so bad I..."</p>
<p>Emma smiled, eyebrows arched. Wicked.</p>
<p>"Oh... OK... No Daddy, I know I... Only for Jason. Only for my Jaybird. I'll be a good girl and share, I promise. OH! Oh, Jay Jay. I need you, too. OK? Come for me, Jason. Fill me up. Send your sperms right into my naughty puss. It... it wants them so bad. Come for me, Jason. Pump me full of cum and make me yours. Mark me. Own me. Oh...Oh god I want it so bad... Fill your little sister UP!"</p>
<p>Emma straightened in pleasure. Her pussy snapped tight. I felt her incredible, clear cum shoot out in a stream. Splashed on my stomach. My cock paused, one agonizing on-the-edge moment.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>And then I exploded. Everything seemed to shoot out of me. My cum. My essence. My very soul blasted into my baby sister's chute. Soaking her insides. Filling her uterus with my seed like pumping gas into a tank. So much sperm speeding past my cock, into her twat, right past her cervix and into her aching, arching womb. How did she stay on me with such a powerful, endless blast of sperm plowing into her? Like holding a fire hose between her legs, I could almost see her splatted white against the wall.</p>
<p>"OH!" Emma cried. Her body bucked. I held on for all I could. "There it... there... My big brother is FUCKING me. He... he's filling me UP!"</p>

<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>She shook, spasmed. I tried so hard to stay with her. Look her in the eyes. My body cringed with pleasure, like squeezing out a sponge. I forced myself to fight through it -the absolute ecstasy wringing me out - so I could see my baby sister's big, beautiful cum.</p>
<p>Emma's pupils grew huge. Got greener and greener till it seemed like she lit up the room. Then suddenly, her eyes filled with tears and she was crying. Weeping. Screaming out her pleasure so hard she'd be hoarse for days.</p>
<p>"THERE IT IS!" she shook and then fell into me. head buried in my chest.</p>
<p>"I... I fucked... my brother... I fucked my fucking brother and then he fucked me."</p>
<p>My cock somehow emptied even more into her. We both shook with every pulse of sperm.</p>
<p>"My big brother... coming in me... my pussy... My womb. Oh god... so good. So good."</p>
<p>My cock kept shooting, somehow. Unloading ever more of myself inside her. Each blast ever more ecstasy.</p>
<p>"Oh... Oh baby... Oh baby sis," I babbled. My fingers dug into her shoulders. My head buried in her neck, "... oh... so good... So good... Oh Emma..."</p>
<p>Finally, I felt the pleasure release me. My cock twitched and Em twitched with it. I picked my head up, careful, and slowly traced her neck with my tongue. Sucked on her ears, just like Kristen had to me. Licked the tears off her cheeks. Stroked her silken hair with my hands while she sobbed out her pleasure. Pressed her mouth to mine in a way that screamed love louder than I could ever shout it.</p>
<p>I realized - there it was. That satisfaction. The feeling, finally, of having done something well and wonderful and needing not another thing more. I could have sat forever there, trapped inside my amazing little sister, pressed between her legs, drifting softly off to sleep.</p>
<p>In my periphery, I could see Kristen and Ashley, looking on in wonder.</p>
<p>Tears all gone, body in repose, Emma picked up my head with both her hands and held it tight. Then she dangled her fingers downward over her clit, the tips teasing back and forth on my already recovering cock.</p>
<p>"Again," she commanded.</p>
<p>The next morning was not happily ever after. We packed up our things and, one by one, set out on the dinghy for shore. I went back to school, like nothing had happened. My life irrevocably changed forever.</p>
<p>I never saw Ashley again, which I could have predicted before the weekend began. I never saw Sam either, though, which I still think is pretty sad. We had this long, amazing friendship and in one weekend I managed to literally fuck it all up.</p>
<p>I think back, at the life I have... I mean, I wouldn't do anything differently, but... It just makes me sad sometimes. That's all.</p>
<p>I did see Kate a couple of times, mostly just checking in. She tried to get me back into bed with her, but I knew Emma'd never forgive me for such an indiscretion. My little sister really did hate her some Kate. We both moved on.</p>
<p>That day, back at the boat - after we'd unloaded everything - I drove Emma and Kristen back to school. It was about a two-hour drive and we spent a lot of time talking about nothing. I know, it's strange - you share this amazing intimate moment with someone. Something that should change everything about you, them, the whole relationship.</p>
<p>Yet, with all the time in the world, it all somehow manages to come back to McDonald's breakfast sandwiches, the warmer weather, and what you're planning for the 4th of July. People are weird. Pretty sure I've said that a few times now.</p>
<p>As we pulled up to the school, Kristen kissed my on the mouth and climbed out of the back seat. Then Emma leaned over and did the same.</p>
<p>"Wait," I said, "Before you go..."</p>
<p>"You're gonna see me again," Emma said, teasing, "We're kinda related, y'know."</p>
<p>"So I'm told... I just wanted to ask you. Before... I mean, on the boat. When I was... Well, when Kristen and I were..."</p>
<p>"Fucking?" Kristen asked, "JJ, you can't do the stuff you did and then act like you're afraid to talk about it."</p>
<p>"Fine," I said, sheepish, "Right before Kristen and I were gonna fuck, you told me that if I came in her, you'd take your revenge on me..."</p>
<p>"You're saying you want her to do something terrible to you?" Kristen asked. She leaned in through Emma's open window.</p>
<p>"No... just... I'm just curious. What were you gonna do?"</p>
<p>"I already did it," Emma said, smiling.</p>
<p>"Wait... what?" I looked around the car, frantically searching for the poison, the bomb, whatever.</p>
<p>"When did you...?"</p>
<p>"After," Emma said, "After you came in Krissy, I took my fucking revenge. Just like I said I would"</p>
<p>"I still don't..."</p>
<p>"Silly boy. I made you come in me. If you were gonna impregnate Kristen, I was gonna get your baby, as well. That was my revenge."</p>
<p>I looked at her, totally confused.</p>
<p>"That was MY punishment? To knock you up?"</p>
<p>"Yup," Emma said, "Don't you get it, extra super big bro? You're our stud now. Like Krissy said, you're gonna stick it in me again and again and the only time you can take it out is so you can stuff up our gorgeous Krissy. Fucking revenge. Accent on the fucking. You gave us both your baby and so now you have to keep fucking me and Kristen till forever. Breed us till we fucking burst."</p>
<p>She kissed me. Playfully tousled my hair.</p>
<p>"You mean, the whole time, you wanted me to... Both of you..."</p>
<p>"Pretty much," Kristen said, shrugged.</p>
<p>"In fact," Emma said, giving my cock a playful squeeze from the passenger seat "I think you ought to start right now... Y'know, so long as you're comfortable with that arrangement?"</p>
<p>Oh yes. Yes, I most certainly was.</p>
