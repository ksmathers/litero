<p>Lyta stumbled out into the street, a little bit drunk, a little bit giddy and hell of a lot horny.</p>
<p>She'd spent several hours at the Halloween party, enjoying her newly single status. Flirting with men, enjoying their looks at her slender legs and revealing costume, thinking about what fantasies were going in their heads while they talked to her. But she wasn't going to fool around with them. They were cute, but they were young. They were dudes. She had no real desire to spend the night with an amateur fumbling around with her in the dark as she tried to will his attention to her clit. It had been weeks since the last time she'd had sex. She needed to be with someone who knew her body.</p>
<p>She took out her phone and scrolled through the numbers as she walked down the street, her heels clicking on the pavement. She hadn't actually slept with that many guys and was on speaking terms with few of those. She briefly considered her recently ex-boyfriend but decided against it. Too much baggage for now. She considered one or two other exes but they weren't quite what she was needing right now. And then she scrolled across Hugh.</p>
<p>Hugh. That was the one. She dialed.</p>
<p>"Hello Lyta," said a deep sleepy voice.</p>
<p>"Oh, Hi," she said, her voice automatically rising an octave. ""You doing anything? Or maybe anyone?"</p>
<p>"No," replied the sleepy voice. "Just sleeping off a long shift."</p>
<p>"Oh well, I don't want to bother you," she said, grinning in the dark street. "I should let you get some rest."</p>
<p>"Oh, I can work you into my busy schedule, I'm sure. Why don't you come over?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm coming," she said with a slight giggle. She checked the street sign. She was only three blocks away.</p>
<p>"You will be," he said and hung up.</p>
<p>Lyta couldn't help but smile as she turned down his street. She could never forget how she'd met him. It was the sluttiest thing she'd ever done in her life. She'd broken up with a boyfriend who was terrible in bed and drunkenly confessed to Heather, her best friend, that what she really needed was a proper fucking. Heather had mentioned Hugh and told her he'd be at a party that weekend.</p>
<p>"He's... just what you need," Heather has said with an enigmatic grin.</p>
<p>She'd gone there in a skirt the barely covered her ass and her sexiest underwear. When Heather had introduced them, she was surprised. Hugh was decent-looking, a man who wasn't endowed with great looks but took care of himself. He was unassuming, polite, respectful. Even in her tiny skirt, he looked her in the eye when he spoke to her and was genuinely interested in her as a person. It was only when Heather mentioned it that she discovered that he was a medical student; possibly the first time a medical student had not told her he was one within the first five minutes of meeting her.</p>
<p>He absolutely did not have the bearing of a player.</p>
<p>"Are you sure about this," she'd asked Heather while Hugh was getting them drinks. "He just seems... so nice."</p>
<p>"I think you'll find out how nice he is. He can't take his eyes off you."</p>
<p>She'd gone home with him, more out of curiosity than genuine interest. Even on the way home, the most he did was gently take her hand. But as much as he'd been a Dr. Jekyll at the party, he was Mr. Hyde when the light were out. She'd initiated a kiss when they'd gotten into his apartment. And he was on her with an intensity that was unreal. She'd never orgasmed with a man the first time before, but within fifteen minutes, he'd had her up against the door, her skirt raised, devouring her pussy to a searing climax. Then in the bedroom, he'd gone all night, plowing the stunned girl into near unconsciousness with the most massive cock she'd ever seen. She'd slept like a rock the next day and her poor pussy was sore for a couple of days afterward. But it was far and away the best sex she'd ever had.</p>
<p>In the 18 months since then, she'd made a few more booty calls to him. She usually wasn't in the mood for such intense sex. But once every couple of months, she felt a sudden deep need to be fucked to total sexual exhaustion, to be used until she wasn't sure what month she was in.</p>
<p>Tonight was one of those times.</p>
<p>Hugh lay on his couch, reading a book and waiting for the distinctive click-clack of Lyta's heels. He had been deep asleep when she'd called but just seeing her number on his phone had rendered him wide awake. He couldn't concentrate on the book, reading the same page over and over. Because all he could think about was what he was going to do to her when she arrived.</p>
<p>It had been an unexpected pleasure when Lyta had hit on him at the party. He had noticed her even before she'd spoken to him. She was hard to miss with her pretty face, big brown eyes and shoulder-length brown hair. And her skimpy outfit had emphasized her tall slender frame, her curvy hips, her tiny waist and perky breasts.</p>
<p>He didn't really have a type, per se. But he never imagined being so viscerally drawn to someone. And when she'd spoken to him, when she'd flirted with him, when she'd walked home with him, hanging onto his arm and laughing at his jokes. When the tentative kiss in the doorway had devolved into an intense snog. When she had responded to his sometimes problematic size not with fear but enthusiasm and ridden him all night. It had been the most incredible sexual night of his life.</p>
<p>He'd been sad when she left the next day without even leaving her number. But two months later, she'd called him. And it had been a semi-regular thing since then. Once every couple of months, she'd come over and they'd make the paint peel off the walls.</p>
<p>There was just... something about her. Hugh was always very into sex but with Lyta it was wild. He hadn't been with that many women, partially because some were intimidated by his size. But Lyta -- whose slender figure didn't look like it could take such a big organ -- took all of him easily. She could go all night instead of tapping out after one round. She came like crazy for him. And he just loved the contrast between her slim college girl figure and his big cock. He loved the look she got on her face when he entered her -- surprise, trepidation, surrender and then a growing confidence and enjoyment.</p>
<p>He heard the click of her heels on the pavement outside. And his cock got even harder.</p>
<p>Lyta hesitated a bit. There was still time to turn away. But then the pressing need in her belly made itself felt. She knocked on the door and heard his voice telling her to come in. The door was unlocked.</p>
<p>He was sprawled on the couch, reading a book. He didn't even bother to look up as she entered. But there was no hiding the huge erection that was already straining his boxer shorts.</p>
<p>"I'm not bothering you, am I?" she said. "I can always leave if you're busy."</p>
<p>He closed the book and put it down. His eyes locked on her. Just that look let her know she'd made the right choice. It was almost cute the way he was trying to act casual while devouring her with his eyes. Her little nurse's outfit had gotten her plenty of stares at the Halloween party. Now it was taunting her sometimes lover into wanting to rip it off and take her right there in the open doorway for everyone to see.</p>
<p>"Come over here," he said. The certainty in his voice almost made her cum in her panties.</p>
<p>She locked the door emphatically, put her purse on the table and walked over. He pulled her on top of him and they kissed. At first, just a quick peck. But in moments, they were passionately kissing like they hadn't seen each other in years. She moaned and climbed atop him, the short skirt of the outfit sliding up her hips, her pussy resting against the thick hose of his cock. His hands started at her face, worked their way down to her hips and squeezed. She broke the kiss.</p>
<p>"You are the best kisser I've ever met," she moaned. "I could cum just from this."</p>
<p>"Then cum," he said. "I won't mind. We have all night."</p>
<p>She began grinding her needy pussy against him as he continued to kiss and grope her. His hands were everywhere, squeezing her perfect ass, tracing the curve from her hips to her tiny waist, kneading her B-cup breasts. One of the things she loved about being with him was that every part of her body seemed to turn him on. He groped her like he didn't have enough hands. He pulled open the buttons of her nurse's outfit, exposing her bra-clad breasts. He unhooked the lacy white bra and reached in, grasping the firm mounds, pressing her nipples. Lyta felt like she was about to explode. All that night's flirting was coming out at once.</p>
<p>Hugh's cock felt like it was made of granite. There seemed to be no in-between with this girl. Either they were amicably chatting or they were going at it like animals. He could feel the damp heat of her pussy through the layers of clothing. Her nipples were hard as diamonds, her breasts swelling with each deep breath. And they never stopped kissing. He loved the taste of her, this time accented with a little bit of wine from the party.</p>
<p>He rolled on top of her and her legs wrapped around him. He ground against her needy cunt and she gasped and moaned at the feeling. She felt like such a tramp, writhing beneath this man only minutes after knocking on his door. And she loved it. Something about Hugh always brought out her inner minx. She clutched him tightly as she came, waves of pleasure making her hips buck against him.</p>
<p>"You're making me cum, you're making me cum," she moaned.</p>
<p>The climax slowly faded, leaving her liquified in his arms.</p>
<p>"I've needed that all night."</p>
<p>"Just that?" he asked.</p>
<p>"That... and whatever else you want to do to me. Have your wicked way with me. I'm yours."</p>
<p>He went into the bedroom. In a minute, he emerged, naked and she wriggled on the couch. She was always surprised by how big his cock was. And even more surprised that she was able to take it. It was almost nine inches long and over two inches across, far bigger than any man she'd ever been with. She giggled a bit as she thought about what it was going to feel like inside her. He had already rolled a condom down its formidable length. It glistened with lube.</p>
<p>"Are you sure that thing will fit?" she teased. "I'm not that big a girl."</p>
<p>"I'll make it fit," he said.</p>
<p>He pulled her to her feet. She wobbled a bit, still euphoric from the climax. Then he picked her up in a fireman's carry and carried her into the bedroom. He set her down in front of the bed and slowly peeled off her clothes, kissing and caressing every inch of flesh as it was exposed. When he was down to her little white thong, he began to kiss and nuzzle her through the material.</p>
<p>"Ooh, am I going to get to cum again?" she cooed. "So soon?"</p>
<p>She sat down on the bed. She angled her hips up but he spent his time working his way up her thighs, breathing on and kissing every little bit of her pussy except for her clit, which began to ache with need. He pushed the thin damp panty aside and expertly slipped two fingers into her. She gasped at the combined feeling.</p>
<p>"Yes, darling. Just like that."</p>
<p>Her legs began to give out and she lay back on the bed. She closed her eyes and just enjoyed the sensations. Even after not having seen her for two months, he knew her body like they'd been lovers for decades. He expertly teased her, playing his skilled tongue over every part of her except her clit, his finger slowly but inevitably closing in on her most sensitive spots. She moaned and placed her hands on his head, trying to will him to attack her more directly. But he kept teasing and taunting her, pushing her close enough to the falls that she could taste it, but not over. She lost track of time as she got closer and closer.</p>
<p>"You bastard," she gasped. "Make me cum."</p>
<p>Hugh straightened up and moved between her legs, his giant cock pointing right at her vulnerable pussy. she opened her legs even wider to receive him. She gasped as his enormous head touched her vulva, relished that brief moment of panic when she thought there was no way such a big penis could fit in her.</p>
<p>Hugh took a moment to enjoy the sight of her. Ready, waiting, wanting. His cock ached, needing to be encased in her.</p>
<p>The fat bloated head touched her vulva and they parted willingly. She writhed on the bed as he slowly eased inch after inch into her tight pussy, stretching her like no one else could. As he did, he rubbed her clit and the orgasm that had been building for so long rushed toward in in a terrifying wave. When he was fully inside her, his head right against her cervix, she exploded. She cried out. Her hips bucked of their own accord. Her hands tore at the sheets. Her pussy tried to grip him but he was just too big. On and on it went as he relentlessly stroked into her, stimulating her entire vagina.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," she cried out. "There's that big fucking cock. I've needed you inside me all night. Keep going!"</p>
<p>"I intend to," he grunted.</p>
<p>Over and over, he plowed into her. Within a few minutes, she'd recovered her wits and began to push back at him, leveraging his massive cock toward her most sensitive spots. He grinned wolfishly as she became more and more aggressive.</p>
<p>Finally, they rolled over. Lyta loved being on top of him. She could move her hips to make his giant cock touch every bit of her. And he would play with her breasts or rub her clit as she did so. In no time, she was cumming again, this time a long sweet drawn out climax that left her gasping for air and his cock soaked with her wetness.</p>
<p>"I want you to cum," she moaned.</p>
<p>Hugh repositioned himself behind her and grasped her curvaceous hips. She gasped as he resumed his relentless fucking. He felt so deep from this angle. She couldn't tell if she was climaxed out or was just low-key cumming the whole time, but it was heavenly. Hugh knew he wouldn't last much longer. Just the site of her tiny waist curving into her full hips would be enough to make any man cum. And at this angle, she was so tight but so yielding at the same time, taking every inch of him and loving it. His thrusts began to change and Lyta's consciousness wavered. There was something about the way he thrust into her when he was right on the brink that drove her mad.</p>
<p>"Cum for me," she moaned. "I want to feel you bust."</p>
<p>Hugh grabbed her hips and thrust as deep as he could. He grunted as his cock unleashed spurt after spurt of cum into the condom. He always came a lot but Lyta seemed to bring out a deeper intensity than he'd ever known. He pushed deep into her, his big load straining the latex near to bursting, the swollen semen-filled tip pressing against her unprotected cervix.</p>
<p>"That's it," she gasped as her own climax faded out. "Good boy."</p>
<p>Lyta exhaled deeply. This was what she'd needed all night. To be fucked to the point of exhaustion. She knew the peaceful sated feeling wouldn't last. She'd be spending the night and he would take her two or three more times before she crawled to safety in the morning. But for now, she could just lie back and enjoy the afterglow. For now, she could feel like a bit of a slut, on all fours, still filled with the hefty softening cock of a man she barely knew.</p>
<p>Hugh enjoyed the feeling for a long minute. He had not been expecting any sex tonight. And when his phone had rung, his head had filled with every kind of fantasy. The reality outlived expectations. He hadn't had that many lovers, but Lyta was far and away the best, drawing out his most animalistic tendencies.</p>
<p>He slowly withdrew. Lyta collapsed not the bed and rolled over. Her eyes fixated on the long cream-streaked log between his legs. She still couldn't believe the entire thing fit in her. She felt a little thrill through her belly as she looked at tip of the condom, bloated and heavy with his semen.</p>
<p>"If he put that in me, there's no way I'd hold out. I'd be knocked up for sure," she thought and her body shuddered a bit.</p>
<p>They fucked twice more that night before their mutual lust was sated. Hugh always seemed in an inexhaustible supply of cum, no matter how busy medical school was and Lyta was the only woman he'd ever met who could keep up with him. By 4 am, they were lying in bed, still naked, the room reeking of sex and just idly chatting while they waited to see if they would fall asleep or fuck again. Their record was five times in one night, although both of them had to call in sick the next day from soreness and exhaustion.</p>
<p>After a while, she noticed his phone kept buzzing.</p>
<p>"Who is texting you at this hour? Is there some hot little nurse you need to be servicing?"</p>
<p>"No, it's an ongoing argument among the med students."</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>He hesitated a bit.</p>
<p>"Have you heard of this thing called, um, 'No Nut November'?"</p>
<p>"That's that thing where guys try not to cum for a whole month, right?"</p>
<p>"Right. Well, the students are having a really stupid argument about whether it's healthy or unhealthy."</p>
<p>She sat up and leaned over him.</p>
<p>"So which side are you taking?"</p>
<p>He shrugged. "Neither. I don't think a month of abstinence is going to make a huge difference in your life one way or another."</p>
<p>She nodded absently. Then something began to tickle at the back of her sex-addled mind.</p>
<p>"I bet you couldn't do it, though."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"I bet you couldn't do it. Go a whole month without cumming."</p>
<p>"I've had long stretches of being single, you know."</p>
<p>"I don't mean not have sex. I mean not cum. At all. Even from jacking off."</p>
<p>Hugh snorted. Lyta's tickle of a thought was now blossoming into a fully wicked idea.</p>
<p>"I mean, I understand if you need to service the rest of your harem."</p>
<p>"I don't have a harem. At the moment, you're pretty much it."</p>
<p>Lyta looked at him curiously. "Seriously? With that thing?"</p>
<p>"Seriously."</p>
<p>She nodded absently. She'd assumed she was just one of a bevy of women he sorted out on a regular basis. She was genuinely surprised... and a bit saddened... to find out there was no one else in his life at the moment. He deserved better. Hell, the women of their town deserved better. Massive cocks shouldn't go to waste.</p>
<p>"So nothing's stopping you from trying to go a whole month, is there?"</p>
<p>"Apart from my sanity. And-"</p>
<p>"Your lack of willpower," she said, smiling cat-like at him. He grabbed her playfully and they wrestled for a bit until he had her pinned underneath him.</p>
<p>"Sorry if I offended you by suggesting you couldn't go just one little month without touching yourself."</p>
<p>"I tend not to play stupid games when there's no stupid prizes," he said.</p>
<p>"Well maybe there could be a prize," she said.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Lyta wriggled out of his grasp. They wrestled some more until she was on top of him, his soft but still massive cock against her mons.</p>
<p>"I don't need money," he said.</p>
<p>"Well that's good because I don't have any. Impoverished English graduate student, remember?"</p>
<p>"So how will you make it interesting?"</p>
<p>Before she could think about it, the words came out.</p>
<p>"If you go a whole month without cumming... I'll let you fuck me without a condom."</p>
<p>Hugh snorted.</p>
<p>"And cum inside me."</p>
<p>His eyes suddenly locked on hers.</p>
<p>"Seriously?"</p>
<p>"Yep. All night long if you want. As much of that stuff as you can put in me."</p>
<p>Hugh considered this. It was a bit silly. But there was a part of him that wanted to prove himself to his pretty booty call. And he had to admit; he hated condoms. It wasn't the feeling. It was the way they dried up his partners and made constant lube a necessity, especially for his size. It had been a couple of years since he'd had a steady girlfriend and had been able to go without them. The idea of screwing this little minx without the raincoat and filing her up over and over... his cock stiffened against her.</p>
<p>"Ooh, someone likes the idea."</p>
<p>"How would you keep me honest?"</p>
<p>"Well, I'll check on you. I'll come over on a regular basis and make sure you're sticking to the bet."</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"I think I can tell when a guy hasn't cum in a while. I'll play with you and see how desperately you need to cum."</p>
<p>Hugh thought about it. The idea of going a month without cumming was intimidating. But he couldn't get away from the idea of creampieing Lyta. And, he realized, the idea of her coming over on a regular basis was even more tantalizing. He enjoyed her company and not just because of the wild sex.</p>
<p>"You seriously want to do this? Have a stupid bet just to see if I can do it?"</p>
<p>She shrugged. She'd mostly been joking but seeing how it turned him on... and to be honest, how much the idea turned her on... was making it more real by the second. It always made her cum when he filled the condom with one of his hefty loads. She'd sometimes imagined the condom bursting and is abundant cum filling her to the brim.</p>
<p>"What if I can't make it?"</p>
<p>"If you break the bet... I stop coming by."</p>
<p>"But we wouldn't be having sex."</p>
<p>"You wouldn't. You could still please me though."</p>
<p>Hugh thought about it. He loved going down on women and Lyta was the best he'd ever met at receiving. She knew what she wanted, directed him with ease and came like a fireworks stand struck by lightning. Spending a month just pleasing her sounded far better than a month spent masturbating alone.</p>
<p>His cock was now fully erect against her. Lyta reached over to the bedside table and extracted another condom from the box. She rolled off him and eased it onto his massively hard cock.</p>
<p>"What if I have a wet dream?"</p>
<p>"Can't be helped, I guess," she said. She rolled back onto him and placed the tip of his cock against her pussy. She was sore and she'd be feeling this fuck for a couple of days. But she was also horny at the thought of what lay ahead: a month of teasing her personal sexual beast. Culminating in her filling her up like he owned her.</p>
<p>"Well?" she asked, rubbing his thick head against her vulva. "We agree and I'll give you one last fuck to last you until December."</p>
<p>Hugh put his hands on her soft hips and pulled her down. She gasped as his thick cock pressed deep into her, the wetness of their earlier fuck providing all the lubrication she needed. She shuddered, imagining what it would be like without the latex, skin to skin; imagining how it would feel for one of his hefty loads to be pumped deep inside her, to spend the next day with him leaking into her panties.</p>
<p>He pulled her down and kissed her.</p>
<p>"Challenge accepted."</p>
<p>They had a slow leisurely fuck before falling asleep. Lyta teased him that this would be his last cum for a month so he should enjoy it. And while she couldn't be quite sure, it seemed like he came a little faster and harder thanks to her teasing, filling up the magnum condom with one last copious load of semen.</p>
<p>She was busy for the next two days, working on her dissertation and teaching. But on Tuesday, instead of going home, she drove over to Hugh's place. She could see a light on in his living room and hurried up the stairs.</p>
<p>"How's it hanging, stud?" she giggled when he opened the door.</p>
<p>"Just fine," he said. "Not even noticing it so far."</p>
<p>"Well, let's check the goods."</p>
<p>With a grin, Hugh undid his pants, revealing his boxers, already tented with a prodigious erection. Lyta laughed.</p>
<p>"Turned on already, are we?"</p>
<p>"Always with you."</p>
<p>She peeled the boxers off, revealing his big cock. Even now, the size seemed unreal to her. She inspected it like it was a zucchini in a market. She stroked it a few times and he grunted.</p>
<p>"Hmmmmm," she said. "Feels good. Balls feel full. Let me see how you respond to this."</p>
<p>Lyta undid the top button on her shirt, exposing her modest but firm cleavage. And to Hugh's surprise, she began to kiss and lick him.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" he gasped.</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I won't let you cum. Just making sure you're sticking to the bet."</p>
<p>"By blowing me?"</p>
<p>"By seeing how desperately you need to get off."</p>
<p>Lyta knew she couldn't be sure he was sticking to the bet. It wasn't like there was a little sign under his cock reading "3 days since last ejaculation". She'd suggested it mostly just to keep him honest.</p>
<p>But now that she was here, she realized that even after three days -- two and a half, really -- he was already feeling it. He was responding to her with more need, his cock already leaking precum into her mouth. He usually responded to blowjobs as just a preview to fucking. But tonight, he was very into it. And it was turning her on.</p>
<p>She realized the tables had turned. This was her chance to do a little bit of teasing. This was her chance to drive him to the brink of climax and then just let him... wait.</p>
<p>She reached under her skirt and began to stroke her excited pussy through her damp panties. Hugh's cock swelled in her other hand.</p>
<p>"I don't think I'm going to last long," he grunted.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll make you last."</p>
<p>Lyta began to suck and kiss him. Her mouth could barely encompass his considerable girth but she was determined to make this last. Hugh began to feel weak in the knees as she pleasured him. Very few women could go down on him with his size and none with the abandon that Lyta was showing. In no time, his balls began to ache with need and he began to feel his orgasm approaching.</p>
<p>"Honey, I-"</p>
<p>He gasped as Lyta squeezed his cock, forestalling his pending climax. A single drop of precum emerged from the slit and she eagerly lapped it up. And then she began to taunt him, bringing him right up to the point of climax and then letting him down. Over and over again, her talented lips and fingers brought him there. At one point, she had to stop as she got herself off, cumming hard against her fingers. The site of his sometimes lover climaxing brought Hugh right to the brink, his cock twitching, just moments away from hosing her down. But she kept him right there, just on the brink.</p>
<p>Finally, Hugh's strength gave out. He sank to his knees, his cock jerking madly as it tried to cum. Lyta watched in fascination, expecting him to explode at any moment. But all that emerged was another single pearl of precum.</p>
<p>Hugh gasped. No one had ever brought him this close without sending him over the edge. Just one more stroke would have done him in. His balls felt like cannonballs.</p>
<p>Lyta lay on her back and spread her legs, her skirt hiking up to her hips, exposing her panties.</p>
<p>"As long as you're down here," she said, grinning ear to ear.</p>
<p>"Is my work never done," Hugh sighed. He bent down and began kissing his way up her inner thighs. After a while, he reached up to push her panties to one side but she shook her head.</p>
<p>"Underwear stays on."</p>
<p>Hugh began devouring her soaked pussy, feeling for her clit and vulva through the filmy material. Lyta threw her head back and moaned. If she'd let him take her panties off, she would have cum for him in seconds, she was so excited. But the tiny barrier was just enough to drag it out, to build her climax up with agonizing slowness. Lyta's legs began to shake and her hips began to squirm.</p>
<p>"You're going to make me cum so hard," she purred.</p>
<p>Her excitement was amplifying Hugh's. His cock remained rock hard, desperate to be buried in this beautiful writhing woman. And Lyta wouldn't have stopped him. If he had pushed her panties aside and slid his big cock into her, she would have exploded. Indeed, just thinking about it sent her over the falls. she bent forward as she came hard against his skilled tongue. Hugh began to back off but she roughly pushed his head back down.</p>
<p>"Keep going!" she cried. "I'm still cumming."</p>
<p>Lyta had never had multiple orgasms like this, one erupting on top of the other. She writhed against him, both trying to get her sensitive clit away from his relentless tongue and trying to force it against him, trying to draw out the climaxes and needing them to stop before she died. Finally, she pushed him away.</p>
<p>"OK, you need to stop," he gasped.</p>
<p>Hugh sat back and watched her come back down to Earth. Lyta's breath began to slow, her labia slowly stopped pulsing. He was right on the verge of going off himself. A few strokes and he would have deluged her. But the thought of cumming inside her was too tempting, at least for now.</p>
<p>As Lyta slowly recovered her wits, she found herself in a dilemma. On the one hand, the blowout climax had left her so mentally frazzled. she could barely remember her own name. On the other, her pussy was, if anything, more needing to be filled. She still needed to be fucked. As the post-orgasmic haze faded, her horniness won the battle.</p>
<p>It took a moment for her legs to start working again. But then she sat up and walked out of the room. Hugh went over to the couch and flopped down, his cock still massively erect. She emerged carrying one of his magnum condoms.</p>
<p>"I want you inside me," she said.</p>
<p>"I thought we said-"</p>
<p>"I won't let you cum. I just want to get off on you."</p>
<p>"And tease me some more? If my balls get any bluer, they'll pop off."</p>
<p>"Well, then, you know lots of doctors who can sew them back on," she said.</p>
<p>Feeling totally in command, she pushed him back. She rolled the condom down his big erection, grinning at how well he filled out the oversized latex. she then slathered lube on him and he moaned as she stroked up and down.</p>
<p>His eyes lit up as she slid her panties down her legs and then sat astride him, her skirt rising to her waist, her smoldering pussy rubbing against him. She rocked back and forth a bit. His hands gripped her ass and he pulled her close for a kiss.</p>
<p>"You're enjoying his, aren't you?" he said.</p>
<p>"You'd better believe it," she replied.</p>
<p>Lyta groaned as she lowered herself onto him. Even though it had only been a few days, she was still surprised by just how massive he was. But, as always, they were well-matched. She eased herself down, letting her pussy get used to him. When her ass finally met his thighs, she moaned deeply.</p>
<p>"I love having you inside me," she said. "You're so fucking big."</p>
<p>"I love being inside you," he grunted in response. "Nobody else takes me like you do."</p>
<p>Lyta slowly began to rock her hip back and forth, letting his girth grind against her most sensitive spots. She felt so dirty, riding him on the couch, still fully clothed. Hugh pulled down her shirt to reveal her tight lacy bra. He began kissing and licking her breasts through the material.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said. "You're going to make me cum so hard."</p>
<p>She rocked back and forth for another few minutes, sliding his cock over her g-spot over and over again, grinding her clit into him, pushing herself right up to the edge. And then, she went over. She gasped and whimpered as her pussy exploded with pleasure, sending waves through her body. She shook life a leaf on top of him, unable to even speak.</p>
<p>"Honey, you're going to make me cum," moaned Hugh.</p>
<p>Lyta couldn't stop, though. Her body was acting on its own accord, instinctively trying to milk sperm out of her mate, trying to get pregnant, condom or no condom. She writhed and squeezed and rocked her hips as her orgasm continued, enshrouding her in painful bliss. It took an effort of supreme will for Hugh to keep from cumming with her. Every squeeze of her tight little pussy threatened to make him burst the condom with his cum. Even just watching the slim girl writhe and jerk would be enough to make any man cum. He gasped and panted as his balls got right up to the point of release. But he was just able to hold off. It was frustrating but it was also hot as hell. He knew he couldn't last much longer but he also wanted to fuck her like this all night.</p>
<p>Lyta opened her eyes as she came down off the orgasmic high. The room seemed to glow. She could see Hugh's red face as he struggled not to cum. His formidable cock felt gigantic inside her, swollen with pending climax. She knew she could get him off easily. Just a few movements of her hips, some strategic moans and she would feel that familiar thrilling pulsation of his mighty cock inside her. She desperately wanted to; she did so enjoy it when he came. But she stopped just shy.</p>
<p>They kissed for another long while and then she climbed off him, his still hard dick emerging, the condom slathered with her juices.</p>
<p>"You've got some willpower, I'll give you that."</p>
<p>"I just enjoy being in you too much to let it end."</p>
<p>Lyta hesitated, then giggled. "I actually don't know what to do right now. I feel like I should jack you off or something."</p>
<p>"That would kind of defeat the purpose," Hugh said.</p>
<p>He stood up and went into the bathroom where he slowly peeled the condom off his rock-hard cock and dropped it in the trash. When he came back in, Lyta felt deliciously vulnerable looking at his angry cock. She knew how badly he wanted to jump on top of her, plow away with abandon and fill her up. And she wanted it just as badly. For a second, she was sure it was going to happen.</p>
<p>Instead, he sat down on the couch. She sat next to him and snuggled up. They talked for a while -- about his adventures in medical school and her teaching. And then the conversation progressed to their dreams about the future. Lyta realized it was probably the first real conversation they'd ever had. And the whole time, they pretended they couldn't see his still semi-erect cock.</p>
<p>"Aren't you in pain?" she finally said.</p>
<p>"A little. But after you leave, I'll take a shower. That should calm things down."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm naked with a beautiful girl who was cumming all over the place an hour ago. Tends to linger in the mind a bit."</p>
<p>"Maybe I should go then, before you have to go to the ER or something."</p>
<p>He laughed. "Wouldn't that be something. Probably be a bunch of my fellow students in the room."</p>
<p>She stood up reluctantly. For the first time in their relationship, she didn't want to leave.</p>
<p>"Well, we can't have that. If those cute nurses and doctors get a look at that thing? You'll lose the bet in about ten minutes."</p>
<p>Hugh slapped her ass playfully. She wriggled in response.</p>
<p>"One day, you'll have to do that for real."</p>
<p>"Oh, keep coming by and teasing me and it'll happen."</p>
<p>"It's a date then," she said.</p>
<p>Lyta felt a bit empty as she walked home. She'd satisfied herself. But the sex didn't feel complete without Hugh cumming. She felt antsy and unsettled, as though she were the one who'd been taken right to the brink and then denied. For a moment, she was going to march back to his apartment and make him cum. In a condom, in her mouth, on her back. She didn't care as long as she felt that familiar twitching and heard the familiar moan as he lost control.</p>
<p>But her stubbornness re-asserted itself. She'd made the bet; she wasn't going to be the one who gave out on it.</p>
<p>After that, Lyta started coming by almost every day for "inspection". Their respective schooling made the hours irregular so they started texting to arrange for her visits. And, after a few days, they were just texting about everything, with the "inspections" as an excuse.</p>
<p>She would examine his cock, play with it, jerk it, ride it for a while. She would get herself off two or three times on his cock and tongue. And then leave him erect and groaning with the need for release. After the first few days, he asked her to stay for dinner. And then it became a thing: she'd stay over and they'd chat or watch TV. And she would occasionally steal glances at his cock or stroke it through his pants.</p>
<p>She hadn't expected to enjoy this but she was having a blast. Hugh was always so sexually dominant and it was a thrill for her to turn the tables. To tease him, to taunt him, to get herself off while he was left high and dry. When she came in and demanded to see his cock, she felt like a drill instructor demanding to inspect his rifle. And she felt like a sex fiend just using him to get herself off. And there was a deep thrill in teasing the beast, knowing that he wanted to and could easily throw her down and ravish her until she didn't know what month she was in. And knowing that part of her desperately wanted him to.</p>
<p>It was obvious that he was sticking to the bet. His cock was now rock hard the second she undid his pants. His balls were heavy. And he was having to exert steadily more effort not to cum. Which, of course, made her taunting of him even more fun. His fucking had changed too. Gone was the relentless aggression, the confidence that he could pound her as hard as he liked and stave off orgasm until he was ready. Now he was almost tentative, like a virgin trying not to cum his first time. She was in control of her orgasm, rocking her hips and grinding her clit against him until she came. And enjoying his grunting red-faced expressions as he held off from bursting the condom with over a week's worth of buildup.</p>
<p>"I'm getting hard all the time," he said after about ten days. "In class. In lab. Do you know how hard it is to hide this thing when it's hard? I'll be lucky if I make it through this month without getting a complaint,"</p>
<p>"Or having some sexy nurse drag you into a closet. Not many women could resist that thing."</p>
<p>"You'd be surprised."</p>
<p>She thought briefly about Heather, who had introduced her to Hugh. Heather was a nurse at the area hospital. She wasn't sure how they'd met -- Heather didn't work with the medical students or anything -- but somehow they'd ended up having the occasional rendezvous in various hospital closets. She imagined Heather walking around in her scrubs, which could barely conceal her curvaceous body and big tits, and Hugh's eyes glazing over as his pants distorted. And she was surprised to find that while the image turned her on, it also made her a bit jealous.</p>
<p>"It looks bigger than ever," she teased, stroking his formidable length. "I'm not sure it would even fit in me now."</p>
<p>"One way to find out," he grunted.</p>
<p>It was on the tenth day that she made her only mistake. She was kneeling in front of him, fully clothed, stroking and sucking his massive purple cock. He was grimacing with the effort. And then suddenly he cried out.</p>
<p>"Honey, you have to stop. I'm going to cum."</p>
<p>Lyta thought she knew his body well enough to hold him right on that edge. She slowed her pace, squeezing him agonizingly. On previous nights, this had pushed him right to the edge, milking out a little bit of precum but not letting him blast off. But there was something about her tonight that had him extra aroused. Too late, she realized she'd gone too far. His cock began jerking mightily in her hands.</p>
<p>"No, no," he cried out, trying to hold back. But it was too late. His prostate was filling with cum, his cock swelling as it prepared for the long-teased explosion. Lyta quickly decided to just go with it and began stroking him even faster.</p>
<p>"It's OK," she said. "Cum for me. You've earned it. I won't count it against you."</p>
<p>He cried out as his big balls released for the first time in ten days. Lyta put the massive pulsating head in her mouth. And then, suddenly, her mouth was full of cum.</p>
<p>Hugh was always a big cummer, but this was something else. The first spurt overwhelmed her mouth, almost making her gag. She released his cock as she struggled with the load and he fired a second spurt, hosing down her chest with a long thick gout of semen. Again, she just went with it, letting the next few spurts hit her face, spattering large drops of semen all over her glasses and even into her hair.</p>
<p>"Cum for me," she said, stroking his spurting cock. "Get it all out."</p>
<p>He grunted and moaned as a few last spurts came out, followed by one thick rope that made it impossible for her to see out of her glasses.</p>
<p>"Wow!" she said, giggling. She took off her glasses.</p>
<p>"Sorry," he panted. "I didn't mean to get it all over you."</p>
<p>"Don't apologize," she giggled. "That was impressive."</p>
<p>He sagged onto the couch. She climbed over and snuggled against him, still idly stroking his defeated cock. He finally took her in. Her hair and shirt were dripping. It turned him on a bit, but he was also aware that she couldn't go out like that.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"How... uh... do you need me to... like lend you some clothes or something?"</p>
<p>"I should be OK. But do you mind if I use your shower?"</p>
<p>"Be my guest."</p>
<p>She stood up and began to move to the bathroom. But then she stopped herself and began to slowly strip down right there in the living room. She slowly undid her skirt and let it slide down her curvaceous hips, exposing her white thong panties. Then she undid the top, button by button, drinking in his open stare as she slowly unveiled her tight black bra. Next, she unclasped the bra, held her breasts together for a moment and then let it flutter to the floor. She let him stare at her firm 34-B's before sliding the panties down her legs, leaving her completely nude. By the time she'd finished, she could see Hugh's cock beginning to recover, stirring slowly against his thigh.</p>
<p>She waved to him and then walked into the bathroom, putting a little more swing into her hips. She didn't turn around, but she knew he was watching her the entire way.</p>
<p>She expected him to follow her in. But it was a few minutes before he did. She took advantage of the time to shampoo the cum out of her hair and wash her body. By the time the shower curtain parted and he came in, his massive erection sheathed in a condom and ready to go again, she felt like a new woman. She glanced down at his cock and then backed up against the wall.</p>
<p>"Oh no," she said with a grin. "I was just innocently taking a shower when this strange man with a giant penis barged in on me. Whatever will I do?"</p>
<p>Hugh climbed into the shower and pressed against her. She melted feeling how far up her belly his cock reached.</p>
<p>"I don't know. Cum all over the place."</p>
<p>"Cum? What does that mean? You mean orgasm? I'm just an innocent grad student. I've never had an orgasm in my entire oh!"</p>
<p>She gasped as he entered her. She moaned as her pussy blossomed open to accept his formidable girth. Every time they did it, he felt like he was far too big for her. But every time, her body responded by accepting him.</p>
<p>"Are you sure this is the way it works? That thing is awfully big compared to where you're putting it."</p>
<p>"You don't seem to be having any problems."</p>
<p>He began slowly plowing into her. Pressed up against the wall, Lyta felt completely in his power, unable to stop him even if she wanted to.</p>
<p>Their previous fooling around had already gotten her horny. Being fucked by her well-endowed partner sent her excitement into the stratosphere. She writhed and moaned as he systematically screwed her against the wall of the shower. She'd missed his aggression, his confidence, his animal lust. As much as being in charge had thrilled her, there was nothing like being taken like this. Within only a few minutes, she came hard against his cock. The angle made him grind her clit on almost every stroke, extending her climax. She dug her nails into his back, her body simultaneously craving the overstimulation and trying to escape it.</p>
<p>But all too soon, he began to slow down, a second climax beginning to build. With a grin, she began squeezing him and moaning a little louder, thrusting her hips against him to keep his cock buried in her tight pussy.</p>
<p>"I love having you inside me," she moaned. "You're so deep. You're going to make me cum again."</p>
<p>Hugh slowed his pace but seemingly increased his depth, driving his big cock as deep as he could with agonizing slowness. Lyta's second climax built and built as he worked his way into and out of her. Knowing that he was trying desperately to hold off his own climax made it all the more arousing to her. She whimpered in his arms as her climax rolled out of her pussy at an agonizing pace. If it hasn't been for Hugh grunting and panting as he tried to hold back his own climax, she would have thought he was deliberately teasing her, trying to deny her the desperately needed climax.</p>
<p>When she finally came back down to Earth, he pulled out of her. She felt a brief flutter of abandonment, resenting that he'd denied her his cum. She opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Hugh's condom-encased cock, still slathered with her cream, jerked and twitched in midair and his face turned red. She expected, at any moment, to see the condom turn white as it snuggled to contain another big load. One stroke would have set him off. But Hugh willed himself not to cum. And eventually the feeling passed, leaving a dull ache in his balls.</p>
<p>"You good?" She asked with a grin.</p>
<p>"You can cum if you want."</p>
<p>"Only when it's inside you."</p>
<p>She giggled in response. As she exited the shower, she noticed that her top was soaking in the sink.</p>
<p>"Oh, you cleaned my top?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I... know a thing or two about getting cum stains off of things."</p>
<p>Her giggle turned into a laugh. "I'm not surprised. That things probably makes you have to hose down the furniture once a week."</p>
<p>They eventually, after a little more groping and kissing, made their way back out to the TV room and sat down on the couch. It felt like the most natural thing in the world, sitting on the couch, him completely naked, his cock still semi-erect, her in just her panties. They talked for a while about school and work. Eventually, she told him she was teaching doing a substitute lecture on Chaucer and she was surprised when he knew something about it.</p>
<p>"Get out of town, I didn't know you read."</p>
<p>Hugh glared at her. "Go check out the office closet."</p>
<p>Lyta walked out of the room. Hugh enjoyed the site of her panty-covered ass making perfect figure-8's and then laid back on the couch. His balls still ached from their earlier stimulation.</p>
<p>Lyta went into the office, which was actually the apartment's spare bedroom. Every inch of space seemed to be covered by some bit of electronic hardware. She shrugged and opened the closet. Then she blinked in surprise. From floor to ceiling, it was filled with books.</p>
<p>She looked closer. There was a lot of variety. Lots of sci-fi and fantasy, of course, but some history books, some classics, even some modern literature. After a while, she was aware of Hugh sidling up behind her.</p>
<p>"Wow," she said. "This is a side of you I didn't know existed. What's your favorite?"</p>
<p>"Dunno," he said. "I like everything. Been reading a lot of classics lately."</p>
<p>She turned around. "You do know I'm getting my PhD in classic literature, right?"</p>
<p>"Well, yeah. That's why I started reading them soon after we met."</p>
<p>Lyta felt a strange flutter in her belly at that. She turned back to the books. Hugh closed in on her and put his arms around her, each hand claiming one of her perky tits. His thumbs rubbed her erect nipples. Again, she wanted to just tell him to forget the bet, to take her right there and then on the floor. And this time to just keep going until he came all over the place. And then to keep going until he couldn't cum any more. But instead they ended up chatting about books for hours, interspersed with occasional light fooling around or teasing.</p>
<p>Walking out of his apartment that morning was a strange experience. She'd left his apartment at dawn several times to do the Walk of Shame, her body sore but her libido sated from an all-night fuck session. But this time, they'd stayed up until dawn just talking. First about books and literature, then about their careers and hopes. Then about things she couldn't even remember. Each hour, she was stunned to find new layers to Hugh, depths she'd never expected to be there.</p>
<p>"How did I spend so much time riding his dick and not realize there was a person attached to it?" She thought to herself.</p>
<p>Toward dawn, she'd let her guard down and talked to him about something that she'd only spoken of to a few people; her fear that her degree would be useless. There were several times as many English PhDs being granted as there were jobs for. And her taste for standard dusty European literature wasn't exactly in demand these days. She'd expected the usual pep talk of "well, do the best you can" or "burn that bridge when you come to it", but he'd said something unexpected.</p>
<p>"Let me ask you something: if you knew... if you knew with absolute certainty that you wouldn't get an academic job... would you still enjoy what you're doing?"</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"Then keep doing it. We'll figure out the rest when the time comes."</p>
<p>She kept thinking about that inadvertent "we" he'd slipped in there. It made her feel a little rush of warmth in her belly. It was all she could do, in that moment, to stick to the bet and not mount him right there on the living room floor. She once again asked herself why she was sticking to the bet. She had nothing to lose by just calling it off and letting him do as he wanted with her. But she shrugged it off. It was just another three weeks.</p>
<p>The next two weeks dragged by. Lyta was going to his apartment almost every day, when their busy scheduled permitted. And while she spent a fair amount of time teasing his cock, they were spending more time just hanging out. Med school was particularly rough for those weeks and, on several nights, he just went to sleep with his head in her lap while watching TV. And she would look down at him and stroke his hair and feel utterly contented. A few nights, she was a bit overwhelmed with everything and she just lay in his arms, also while watching TV, feeling safe from the vicissitudes of her chosen career path. And more and more, they weren't even talking, just enjoying each other's presence.</p>
<p>But there was always that edge. Hugh was painfully aware of her sexuality. He'd always thought she was attractive, even if she wasn't quite his "type". But she was looking more beautiful to him by the day. The exquisite curve of her hips and ass, the prominent swell of her B-cup breasts, her perfect little belly, her big eyes, her short but sexy brown hair. He had never wanted a woman as badly as he wanted her now. Even just lying on the couch, he would catch a glimpse of her bra or feel her legs against him and he would get instantly hard.</p>
<p>She was keenly aware of the way he was looking at her; like a starving man eyeing off food. She was well aware that even the slightest thing from her would get him turned on. And while she reveled in that power, she also found it incredibly arousing to think that, at any moment, he might throw her down and ravish her. She was coming to love her sex appeal in a way she never had before, wearing tight clothes that emphasized her figure, bending over to give him a long gaze at her ass or her tantalizing cleavage. And she was also aware that she as increasingly wanting him to take her. Even as she denied him release, her need was growing.</p>
<p>One night, they were lying in bed, with her idly stroking him, when she said.</p>
<p>"Have I ever told you I like the way you look at me?"</p>
<p>"Oh? How do I look at you?"</p>
<p>"It's hard to describe. Desire, I guess, is part of it."</p>
<p>"I'm sure every guy looks at you with desire."</p>
<p>"But there's a confidence to yours. Like you want me and know you can have me but aren't taking me at that particular moment."</p>
<p>"That sounds way more complicated than I tend to think about you."</p>
<p>"And how do you think about me?"</p>
<p>He rolled over and brushed some hair away from her face.</p>
<p>"Someone I like spending time with. Someone who gets me, at least a little bit. And, yeah, someone I wouldn't mind bending over the nearest convenient surface."</p>
<p>She blushed.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I... you see, growing up, I was kind of an ugly duckling."</p>
<p>Hugh snorted. "Every girl says that."</p>
<p>She kicked him. "No, I mean it. I was tall and skinny and had braces and no boobs and hadn't figured out what to do with my hair. Guys didn't even see me."</p>
<p>Hugh looked at her skeptically. Lyta reached to the nightstand and picked up her phone, thumbed through her Facebook posts and then handed it over.</p>
<p>"I dunno," he said. "I think you were pretty cute."</p>
<p>'Well no one else did."</p>
<p>"I'd have done you."</p>
<p>"No one else wanted to."</p>
<p>"Their loss."</p>
<p>"Anyway, it wasn't until the last few years that I began to have any confidence in my appearance."</p>
<p>"Well, you should. You're smoking hot."</p>
<p>"And so, having someone be so drawn to me, having a stud like you be putty in my hands... well, it makes up for a lot."</p>
<p>"Well, there's something about you. I'm not sure what it is. I mean, you're a beautiful woman but..."</p>
<p>"But what?"</p>
<p>"There's just something about you that turns me on like no one I've ever met. I don't know if this happens to women, but to men, there are some women -- sometimes not even that attractive -- that just bring out your inner beast. The second I saw you, I wanted to tear your clothes off."</p>
<p>"Well, you certainly hid it well."</p>
<p>"At least until we got back here."</p>
<p>She stroked him some more. Once again, that desire to just call off the bet and fuck until dawn suffused her.</p>
<p>"So what are your plans for the holiday?"</p>
<p>"Sleep," said Hugh. "They've been running us ragged lately."</p>
<p>"Not going home? Doing anything with the other med students?"</p>
<p>"No, not really."</p>
<p>She nodded. "Why don't you join me? A few of the grad students are having a get together. You'll probably be bored but it's better than nothing."</p>
<p>"As long as you're there, I won't be bored."</p>
<p>It wasn't until they were walking into the apartment that Hugh realized this was the first time they'd gone anywhere as a couple. For the most part, their relationship has consisted of sex at one of their two places. Occasionally, they would grab dinner or something. But nothing social. Until now.</p>
<p>But it felt very natural as they walked in together, as if they had been dating for years. Lyta introduced him to everyone as "her friend" and he smiled politely. He was terrible with names and quickly forgot almost everyone he'd been introduced to. Except for Heather, whom he'd known in and out of bed for a few years.</p>
<p>Lyta felt the same level of comfort with him. She did notice that he got her a drink and pulled her chair out at the table; little touches that even serious boyfriends never did for her.</p>
<p>After dinner, they wound up in separate conversations. Hugh felt uncomfortable since he really didn't know anyone apart from Lyta and Heather. But once they found out he was a medical student, they found plenty to ask him about.</p>
<p>At one point, Hugh looked across the room and saw Lyta engaged in conversation with a guy and laughing at a joke he'd told. The sight strangely disquieted him. He told himself he had no claim on her; their relationship was just about casual sex. Yet, the feeling of loneliness on being apart from her wasn't to be denied.</p>
<p>A little later, Lyta glanced over and saw him chatting with Heather and was surprised to find that the sight made her a bit jealous. She knew that Heather and Hugh had slept together. She had no idea how serious or casual or how recent their relationship had been. Was he setting up a rendezvous with her? She shook her head.</p>
<p>"Don't be ridiculous, Lyta."</p>
<p>Still, she found herself wandering over and hooking her arm through his. He looked down at her in surprise and then happiness. And they spent the rest of the evening together.</p>
<p>As they drove home, Lyta looked over at him, his face occasionally illuminated by the street lamps. It had been a wonderful evening. Despite his discomfort, her friends had liked him and several has asked if they were a thing. She'd shaken her head but, toward the end of the evening, Heather had pulled her aside and asked why she hadn't told her they were dating.</p>
<p>"Oh, he's not my boyfriend. We're just friends. With benefits," she said.</p>
<p>"I mean, I know about the benefits. Believe me. But..."</p>
<p>"But what?"</p>
<p>"Well, can't you see it? That boy's crazy about you."</p>
<p>"Oh, it's just the sex."</p>
<p>"Trust me, Lyta. With me, it was just the sex. With you... he is smitten."</p>
<p>The words had shaken her a bit. But now, looking at him in the car, she realized that she was developing feelings for him too. All she wanted to do right now was go home -- and she clearly now thought of his apartment as home -- and snuggle up in bed with him. She wished she hadn't made that stupid bet because she desperately wanted to have sex with him, even though she was on her period. There was a feeling of need she'd only ever felt with men she'd been in serious relationships with.</p>
<p>She reached over and touched his hand on the steering wheel. He smiled and put his other hand on hers. She leaned over and snuggled against him.</p>
<p>"Thanks for coming with me," she said, kicking herself for saying something so bland in the moment. "I always feel awkward being alone at those things."</p>
<p>"I enjoyed it," he mumbled.</p>
<p>"Is it OK if I spend the night at your place? I mean, after I check you out."</p>
<p>"I don't think... we can do that anymore."</p>
<p>"Why?" she asked plaintively.</p>
<p>He hesitated a bit and Lyta felt a bit more trepidation.</p>
<p>"Because there's no way I can't lose the bet. I haven't cum for two weeks. And you just... I mean look at you. I get hard just seeing you walk in the door. Just kissing you makes me feel like I'm going to cum all over the place. Last night, I was so close. I feel like if you even touch me, I'll blow the roof off my apartment. Hell, I almost came going down on you this morning, even without touching myself. That's how full I am."</p>
<p>Lyta bit her lip. She was so close to telling him to just forget the bet; to pull over the car, take her right now and cum as hard as he wanted. She was always horny when she was having her period and she knew he wouldn't object. She looked down at his crotch and even in the dim light, she could see the distortion of his big erection. One word and she would be cumming all over it.</p>
<p>In the end, it was just pure stubbornness. There was only one more week.</p>
<p>She kissed his cheek.</p>
<p>"I'll admit, it's been nice having daily access to this thing. But just one more week... just seven more days... just.. uh.."</p>
<p>"168 hours."</p>
<p>"And I'm completely yours. At least for one night."</p>
<p>They drove on in silence.</p>
<p>"I'd still like to spend the night. No funny stuff. I'll keep my clothes on."</p>
<p>He looked at her.</p>
<p>"I just... like being with you. sometimes."</p>
<p>"Me too," he said.</p>
<p>Lyta couldn't sleep that night, lying beside him in bed. She was thinking about what was going on between them. Heather's words still bothered her. For 18 months, this had just been the occasional booty call. She'd thought they'd had nothing in common, apart from mutual lust. He was that well hung guy who, every now and then, fucked her brains out.</p>
<p>But now. She genuinely looked forward to his company. She liked just lying next to him in bed. Going with him to Thanksgiving had felt so natural and unforced. Was she confusing amazing sex with genuine feeling? She realized the next week would be a good test of that. Without any sex, things would sort out. She finally curled up against him. Hugh stirred a bit and then put his arm around her, almost possessively. She sighed contentedly and drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>A week later, Lyta laughed at how wrong that assessment had been. If a week without sex had been agony for Hugh, it had been torture for her. Normally, she was fine going without sex for a while. Even when she was in relationships, once a week was enough to keep her satisfied. But right now felt like the early phase of a relationship, when her sex drive was incredibly strong.</p>
<p>Just being around Hugh, knowing what he was capable of, knowing she was one word away from being fucked into incoherence, had her hornier than she could ever remember being. Her pussy felt empty and wet all the time. She normally masturbated once a week or two weeks. Now she was doing it twice a day, just so she could concentrate.</p>
<p>But at long last, it was the 30th. Just a few hours more and she could ride him until they both passed out. She was confident things would return to normal after that -- just the occasional no strings attached sex. Without the silly bet, what would they do together?</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>As they day dragged on, her excitement level rose and rose. She found herself fantasizing about how it would play out. Would she taunt and tease him one last time before finally letting him explode? Or would he just ravish her the second she walked in his door? When he came inside her, maybe it would be missionary so they could look into each other's eyes. Or from behind so he could fill her like the bull he was. She had never before found herself so distracted by sexual thoughts; she could usually compartmentalize, at least while working. But she felt like a girl about to lose her virginity. It was all she could think about.</p>
<p>Hugh was also having a rough day.</p>
<p>As had been normal for the last few days, he had woken with a massive hardon and a desperate need to rub it out. But he'd gotten through his morning, thinking only that tonight would be the night that he'd finally get some relief at the hands (and mouth and pussy) of his friend.</p>
<p>But the day was dragging on. He was in the hospital observing surgeries. And his mind was totally out of it. All he was aware of was his semi-hard cock. With his size, it was difficult to keep concealed so he'd put it down the leg of his boxers. But the constriction of the boxers and the rub of the scrubs against the head had him constantly fighting off getting fully erect in front of everyone.</p>
<p>At one point, a nurse had brushed up against him and he'd been moments away from flooding his scrubs with semen. Late in the day, a student he'd once had a brief relationship with noticed the bulge and laughingly suggested he come back to her place later on. From that point, all he could think of was taking her and Lyta side-by-side, one after the other.</p>
<p>By the time he got home, his nerves were shot and his balls were glutted and aching. He lay down on the couch, keenly aware of how close he was. A few strokes and he would have been soaking the ceiling. He drifted off into an uneasy sleep.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Lyta walked up the steps to his apartment. She was excited for what was about to happen; she couldn't remember ever being this empty or this wet. But she was also trembling a little bit with nervousness.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with you," she asked herself. "You've had sex a million times. This is no different."</p>
<p>But she knew it was. She had that feeling that something special was about to happen. She hesitated for a moment before lightly knocking on his door. Then more firmly. No answer, even though she could hear the TV going. She was about to call him when she remembered he'd given her a key. She opened the door.</p>
<p>Hugh was sprawled on the sofa, asleep in a pair of boxers.</p>
<p>She decided to let him sleep for a bit. She knew that school was running him ragged. She quietly closed the door. She went into his bedroom and stripped down to the lacy black pushup bra and panties she'd worn for the occasion. They itched a bit but made her feel incredibly sexy. She then went through his closet and picked out one of his shirts. She checked herself in the mirror one last time and then went into the living room and sat down next to him. He stirred a little bit, but didn't waken. She bent over and kissed him gently on the lips.</p>
<p>He didn't wake up.</p>
<p>She kissed him again.</p>
<p>He stirred slightly but didn't wake.</p>
<p>"Hey dummy," she said quietly. "Time to wake up. A hot chick is here to ride you until dawn. Time to perform."</p>
<p>He stirred a little bit more.</p>
<p>"Free sex! All you can eat!"</p>
<p>He stirred again.</p>
<p>Lyta pouted. Then she smiled and began to rub the hefty bulge in his boxers. It stirred heavily underneath the fabric. She slowly lowered his underwear, revealing the thick log of his cock. She began kissing and nuzzling it. Still Hugh didn't wake, although his cock began to respond, starting to firm up in her hands. Lyta continued her careful ministrations. And within a minute, he was massively erect. She put her head over the big helmet and Hugh's eyes finally fluttered open.</p>
<p>"Well, hello sleepyhead," she said.</p>
<p>"I was having the best dream," he mumbled. "And then I woke up and it was true."</p>
<p>She climbed up him and they kissed, long and deeply. She ground her pussy against his monstrous cock, her panties wet with excitement. His hands roamed over her body, squeezing her curvaceous hips and bottom, holding her slender waist, creeping their way up to her excited tits. In just minutes, she was hornier than she'd ever been in her life.</p>
<p>Hugh grabbed the shirt and she lifted her arms, letting him pull it off her. He drank in the site of her -- the pushup bra made her tits look spectacular. He pulled her down and kissed the soft tops while his hand squeezed and caressed her hips. He'd never seen a woman look so sexy.</p>
<p>"Take me," she whispered into his ear. "I need you inside me".</p>
<p>Hugh shifted his hands to the straps of her panties. She raised herself up so he could slide them down her long legs. She positioned herself on top of him, his thick head against her soaked vulva. She wanted to savor the moment, draw it out a little more, have a little more play time. But her body moved of its own accord, sliding down, letting his thick cock spread her pussy wide. She gasped in excitement as inch after inch slid into her, every inch grinding against her excited clit.</p>
<p>"Yes," she moaned. "There's that big cock."</p>
<p>The bare skin-to-skin contact made them both mad with lust. Hugh had always liked the feel of her, but her pussy felt so tight and warm on him. And Lyta couldn't believe how massive his uncovered cock felt inside her. As though he was even bigger without the latex. Her pussy opened up, getting wetter with each passing moment, allowing him all the way in. Without the latex, Lyta's natural wetness was more than enough for them. She felt the tingle of pending orgasm beginning already.</p>
<p>"I'm going to cum so fast for you," she moaned.</p>
<p>She began posting on him, gradually building speed as her vagina got used to his size. Her excitement level continued to rocket up. She couldn't remember ever being this horny. Before this, she'd gone months without sex without any problem. But now, three weeks without riding him seemed like forever. And her body was losing itself in satisfying its need.</p>
<p>"I'm going to make this up to myself," she thought. "I'm going to have him fuck me every night this month."</p>
<p>Just the thought of that made her shudder and moan. She imagined herself lying on her back, night after night, as Hugh pounded her through orgasm after orgasm. And she felt her first orgasm bloom deep inside her pussy. She began riding him harder and harder, his big cock touching all the sensitive spots deep in her pussy. Hugh's balls began to clench as he approached his first release in three weeks.</p>
<p>"Honey," grunted Hugh. "I'm not going to last long."</p>
<p>"It's OK," she gasped. "Neither am I. Cum inside me. Fill me up."</p>
<p>Hugh's cock swelled deep inside her and that sent Lyta right over the falls. She couldn't even cry out as the climax seared through her body. All she could do was sit atop her lover, shaking with pleasure.</p>
<p>And then Hugh cried out as he exploded. His consciousness wavered as he sent rope after rope of potent cum deep into her unprotected pussy. The reality of inseminating his beautiful lover was even better than he imagined.</p>
<p>Lyta could only shudder and moan as her climax went on, spurred to new heights by the feel of Hugh's abundant cum filling her up. Big globs of it began to leak out around his thick cock, making squishing sounds as he continued to thrust up into her.</p>
<p>"He's cumming so much in me," she thought. "No one's ever cum so much in me."</p>
<p>It felt like they held that position for hours, his cock spurting deep inside her and her pussy squeezing him for all he was worth. Then they finally both shuddered and she collapsed on top of him, their sweaty bodies a tangled mass.</p>
<p>For a while, they just lay their breathing. Finally, Hugh took a deep shuddering breath.</p>
<p>"Well, that was a hell of a way to end that abstention thing," said Hugh.</p>
<p>"I'll say," she replied, her eyes still closed and her head against his chest. "You filled me up so much I'll probably be leaking your cum for a week."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a thought occurred to her.</p>
<p>"Oh shit," she said.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I was so eager for this, I forgot. This isn't my safe time."</p>
<p>There was a long pause. Lyta was surprised to find that she wasn't freaked out. She'd had one or two scares before. But this time felt different. It was almost... arousing to think about.</p>
<p>Hugh took a second to process what she'd said. Like Lyta, he should have been freaking out. And like Lyta, he found himself calmly assessing.</p>
<p>"You mean... I may have just..."</p>
<p>"I hope not. I'll take the morning after pill. Hopefully, my little egg can dodge all those sperm you just put so deep in me."</p>
<p>Hugh's massive cock twitched deep in her pussy and Lyta felt a thrill of excitement go through her. She realized there was a part of him that wanted to get her pregnant. And a part of her that wanted him to. That was, after all, what sex was all about at its most basic level. She was still going to get the pill but, in the moment, there was a thrill to the risk they were taking.</p>
<p>Without another world, Hugh rolled them off the couch and onto the floor. Lyta raised her legs high as he began stroking into her again, his cock making slurping noises as it churned the load he'd already put into her.</p>
<p>"Wow, you're hard again?"</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>
<p>"Does the thought of knocking me up excite you?" she asked, wriggling against him.</p>
<p>Hugh didn't reply. But the increased pace and depth of his thrusts was all the answer she needed. Lyta's excitement rocketed back up again. Hugh bent down and they kissed passionately as he continued to plow into her. They'd kissed many times but the intensity of this one was off the scale. They pawed and groped at each other like animals. She raised he hips a bit, allowing him to reach even deeper, giving herself to him completely.</p>
<p>"Fuck me all night," she moaned. "Cum in me all night."</p>
<p>"I intend to," he grunted in reply.</p>
<p>She lay back on the floor, her hips raised, just taking the pounding he was giving her. The sex had always been great, but the absence of the condom made it amazing. She could feel every inch of his cock and he could feel the warm pressure of her tight vagina. Everything was focused down to their primal mating. Lyta felt like she was cumming the entire time, interrupted by occasional explosions.</p>
<p>"This feels fucking amazing," she managed to moan after an endless time.</p>
<p>"You're telling me," he replied.</p>
<p>"I want you to take me all night," she gurgled. "Until I beg you for mercy. Keep going until you can't get hard anymore."</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I have big plans for you tonight."</p>
<p>Without the condom, she was ridiculously wet and accommodating. They had never felt so well-matched. Hugh began plowing her with renewed vigor, as though he hadn't just blown the biggest load of his life. Lyta's excitement rocketed up again and the intense animalism of it all. Rational thought fled her head. If she knew for certain that letting him cum inside her would get her pregnant, she would have let him.</p>
<p>"Lyta, I'm going to cum again," he growled.</p>
<p>Her brain told her to make him pull out, to let him cum like a fountain all over her. Maybe it wasn't too late. But her body was refusing to listen. Every time she tried to speak, she thought of his massive bloated balls overflowing with the huge load he'd built up. She thought of the eruption she'd accidentally coaxed out of him three weeks earlier. She thought of how much he'd filled her in their first explosion. And her body responded, moving of its own accord. Her legs tightened around him, her hips angled to get him as deep as possible.</p>
<p>"Honey, I'm close," he said. His cock throbbed dangerously deep inside her, the fat bloated head right against her cervix. His words sent a shiver down her spine and a spasm through her hips. The wave was cresting and she was powerless to resist. She fought against it but the words came out of their own accord.</p>
<p>"Cum inside me again."</p>
<p>His cock swelled massively in her and she began going over the falls.</p>
<p>"But you might get pregnant."</p>
<p>"I don't care," she cried out. "I'm cumming. Shoot in me. Fill me up again."</p>
<p>Her words released something in Hugh. He grabbed her hips and pushed into her. Her eyes went wide as he penetrated deeper than he ever had. He'd passed a point of no return. He was going to cum inside her even if she suddenly begged him not to. And that loss of control, that feeling of inevitability, pushed her over the falls. Her pussy began squeezing in climax as the most intense orgasm of her life erupted from deep inside. Her mouth opened in a silent cry; her eyes went wide.</p>
<p>Hugh swelled inside her. He'd always been big but now he felt gigantic. She'd never felt him this deep or this wide. Every inch of her pussy was crying out in pain and pleasure.</p>
<p>"Yes!" she cried. "Knock me up!"</p>
<p>He bellowed like a bull as his balls unleashed again. His testicles clenched agonizingly, his prostate swelled. The orgasm was right on the edge of being agony instead of ecstasy. But then his mighty cock started twitching deep inside her pussy. On some level, he knew he should pull out but his body would not obey him. He pushed his cock as deep as he could as the first long thick spurt roared out of his penis, thoroughly saturating her unprotected pussy with tens of millions of more healthy potent sperm, adding to the hundreds of millions he'd pumped into her earlier.</p>
<p>He let her raise her hips up, his cock making slurping noises as it moved in her cum-filled vagina. And he pushed back in, unleashing another long spurt of cum, sending another hundred million sperm out to find and fertilize her little egg. He'd had sex with Lyta dozens of times. But cumming in her unprotected pussy was a level of pleasure he'd never imagined. For a second, he imagined her perfect belly swelling with his baby. And that brought the biggest spurt yet, a thick gout of cum that was certain to breed her. He was cumming even more than he had the first time.</p>
<p>All Lyta could think was, "I love this. He's knocking me up and I love it. I'm such a slut, letting my booty call get my pregnant."</p>
<p>Once again, they collapsed into a sweaty mass. Hugh's cock slipped out of her as he rolled off her and she moaned, feeling the loss. But then he put his arm around her and she curled up against his side, feeling utterly blissful.</p>
<p>They must have dozed off for a while because when Hugh woke, Lyta was once again stroking his semi-hard cock. He tilted his head and kissed her on the forehead. She tilted hers up and kissed him back.</p>
<p>"Lyta, I-"</p>
<p>Her big brown eyes locked onto his.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I think... I think I might be falling for you," he said before he could stop himself.</p>
<p>For a moment, the words hung in the air. Then she kissed him again.</p>
<p>"Well, that's good because I fell for you a few weeks ago."</p>
<p>They kissed for a while, their kisses growing more affectionate and passionate. Eventually, Hugh rolled on top of her again, his reinvigorated cock pressing against her well-used pussy.</p>
<p>"We go again?" she said happily.</p>
<p>"If you're willing to."</p>
<p>"I'm more than willing. Like I said, take me as many times as you want. I haven't begged for mercy yet."</p>
<p>"Should I get a condom this time?"</p>
<p>Lyta laughed.</p>
<p>"You already put so much of that stuff so deep in me, I can't think any more will make a difference."</p>
<p>Suddenly, she remembered something her cousin had told her when the former was trying to get pregnant. That having sex multiple times a day as the best approach. Because it made it more likely that the man's sperm would overwhelm the woman's bodily defenses. The thought of her body being overwelmed by Hugh's abundant sperm -- almost being impregnated against its will -- pushed her arousal even higher.</p>
<p>She pushed him off her and got onto all fours.</p>
<p>"Take me from behind," she cooed. "Knock me up like a slut."</p>
<p>Hugh didn't need to be told twice. He kneeled behind her, drinking in the sight of her impossible curvy hips and tiny waist. He lined his nine inch cock with her cum-soaked pussy. She moaned again.</p>
<p>"Take me again. I'm so yours."</p>
<p>With a grunt, he pushed deep inside her, until he was completely encased. They moaned together, both feeling exquisite pleasure from the union.</p>
<p>"You feel so right inside me," she gasped.</p>
<p>Hugh grabbed her hips and began making long deep strokes, pulling his cock almost completely out and then slowly plowing it into the deepest part of her vagina. Cum squished out and rolled down her thighs in thick rivulets. Lyta came again from the feeling.</p>
<p>"He's servicing me like a bull," she thought. "He's put so much cum in me."</p>
<p>Time flattened again as they went on and on. Lyta felt like she was low-level cumming the entire time, each stroke mercilessly stopping her from coming down from her orgasmic high and just dragging it on, plunge after plunge after plunge. She tried to tell him to stop for the sake of her sanity, but the words wouldn't come out. Her voice acted on its own, moaning and calling out for him to fuck her harder and deeper.</p>
<p>Hugh was right on the brink of cumming from the second he entered her. But at the same time, he had control and could delay it as long as he wanted. He felt like he could go all night like this, fucking his little friend to climax after climax until the sun came up.</p>
<p>Finally, his control slipped. His cock swelled massively. Lyta felt the change in his stroke and managed to grunt out coherent words.</p>
<p>"Yes, my darling. Fill me up again. Fill me up!"</p>
<p>Hugh cried out as his cum sprayed deep into Lyta. Even though he'd already cum twice, he was amazed at how much he was spurting this time. Surge after surge, rope after rope filled her pussy until it squished out from her vulva. And still he kept going. It was agonizing and satisfying at the same time. For a moment, he imagined her little belly swelling with his child and that vision seemed to draw even more cum from his bloated balls. He felt like if she did indeed get pregnant, this was the insemination that would do it. His previous blasts had laid the path. Now more healthy vigorous sperm were racing to find her vulnerable egg.</p>
<p>They collapsed again, gasping for air. Hugh rolled off her, his cock finally softening. His balls felt like they were literally shrinking down from the glutted cannonballs they'd felt like earlier that evening. His cock ached from cumming so hard so often in such a short span of time.</p>
<p>"Ok," he gasped. "I am never fucking doing that again."</p>
<p>"What, cumming in me?"</p>
<p>"No that whole November thing. Once is enough. More than enough. I'm not sure I'll ever cum right again."</p>
<p>"Well, don't worry about it. I won't let you go that long again."</p>
<p>She snuggled up against him and Hugh sighed. Their night. Their month. Their life. Was only just beginning.</p>
