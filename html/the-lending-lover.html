<p>The tavern doors swung open, briefly disturbing the dim solace of Flannery's Pub. I squinted at the approaching silhouette. Allison soon took a seat beside me.</p>
<p>"You're late. I had to drink both our beers," I joked.</p>
<p>Allison laughed. "Sorry, I got tied up with an interesting couple today... Anyway, what are you having?"</p>
<p>I gestured to the bartender to bring us both another round of my last selection. Allison and I chatted for a bit, catching up on what we'd both done in the past week or two since we last saw each other. We had been friends since high school. She was a fertility coach, helping couples through the baby-making process who needed advice or assistance navigating obstacles they faced in the process. I was a service technician for a large food equipment company. Needless to say, she had better stories about work than I did.</p>
<p>"So what was interesting about this couple?" I asked, eventually returning to her initial comment. Admittedly, I looked forward to any commentary on her experiences, which occasionally erred on the explicit side.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, you know how it goes; couple wants a baby, one of them faces infertility issues- this time the guy. They've been mulling over the options. There's just one little wrinkle with this one..."</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"Um..." Allison started, clearly unsure how to explain the situation. "So this woman wants to do everything naturally, which is great, but she's a little unusual in that she's hell bent on extending that to conception as well."</p>
<p>"Meaning, what?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Meaning... she wants to find a surrogate. Not as a sperm donor the traditional way, mind you. She wants to cultivate a relationship with a guy... uh... to impregnate her the natural way." Allison looked at me, half-amused, waiting to gauge my reaction.</p>
<p>I almost spit out my beer with a laugh. "What?!" I asked. "Does that happen?"</p>
<p>"It's not like I haven't heard of it, but it's the first time I've ever encountered it myself," she chuckled.</p>
<p>"But wait... what about her husband. He's okay with this?"</p>
<p>"He seems like he's sorta understanding? But who really knows..."</p>
<p>"Huh... I don't even know how to respond to that." Allison giggled. "So who's the lucky guy who gets all the free sex?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Well first of all, it's not just free sex. They're paying him thousands of dollars for this."</p>
<p>"Wait, what? I know a million guys that would have done it for free."</p>
<p>"I know! But that's how it goes. There's apparently an expected rate for this, per lovemaking session. It's a little bit on the down-low, but with a contract and all." I stared blankly at her. "Anyway... there hasn't been an offer yet. I have to find the guy first, so they can screen him."</p>
<p>"Hmm..." I said, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Allison snorted. "You're not considering it, are you? Please don't tell me you are."</p>
<p>"... Maybe. I could use the money..."</p>
<p>Allison burst out laughing. "Oh man, why did I have to tell you this..."</p>
<p>I chuckled. "Why do you care? So what if I did it?"</p>
<p>"Because it's so weird! I'd never have pegged you as someone to do that. You'd have sex with a woman you just met and get her pregnant for money?"</p>
<p>"I mean... yeah?" We both continued to laugh. Secretly I found the idea highly arousing, but I could tell how embarrassed Allison was getting by how red her face had turned.</p>
<p>"I think this is just the beer talking," she finally concluded.</p>
<p>"Maybe so, but why don't you tell them about me, and we can all sort it out properly together when sober."</p>
<p>I half expected Allison to ignore my request, but as it turned out she did contact them, told the couple all about me, and ended up piquing their interest. A few days later, Allison called me to sheepishly facilitate a meeting in which we'd discuss the matter face-to-face. She didn't seem thrilled to get me involved. In the meantime, I would have to take a series of tests to prove I was healthy and fit for the task.</p>
<p>What was done, was done, but I didn't quite know what I was in for.</p>
<p>The following weekend I was to drive to the next town over to meet the couple and Allison, and make sense of all this. I had no idea how this would all work. I simply went there, dressed to impress, with no real expectations. The couple lived on a quiet, tree-lined residential street. Picket fences, perfect lawns, kids on bicycles; the whole nine yards. I pulled into the driveway behind Allison's car, then got out and nervously approached the door.</p>
<p>I knocked and there was no answer. I knocked again. Suddenly the door opened and a young woman appeared. I was taken aback. She was absolutely beautiful: long brown hair, with subtle curls, big bright eyes, and a beautiful smile with pouty, pink lips. She had a sleek, sexy body, and was wearing a pair of tight jeans that showed off her beautiful, round ass. Our eyes met, and for a moment I felt as if we were both realizing that maybe, just maybe, if all goes well, she and I were inexplicably going to have sex together. The chemistry was undeniably there.</p>
<p>"You must be Nick!" she said, cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Y-yes, sorry- hi, nice to meet you!" I replied, awkwardly extending my hand. She smiled and shook it, then stepped to the side.</p>
<p>"Likewise. I'm Kate. Come in!" I felt her eyes all over me; analyzing.</p>
<p>I stepped inside, finding their home to be modest and welcoming. She directed me toward the living room, where I spotted Allison sitting on the sofa. She saw me and smirked. A man strolled up to me, wearing faded jeans and a flannel shirt.</p>
<p>"Hey. Jeremy," he said, introducing himself simply, and extending his hand. We shook.</p>
<p>"Nick," I said. He studied me carefully. I felt weird, being assessed by this man who's approval I needed to fuck his wife. The whole situation felt exceedingly awkward.</p>
<p>"So! Can I get you a lemonade?" asked Kate.</p>
<p>I saw that Allison had one, so I said, "Sure." She was back in a few minutes with my drink, then invited me to sit down. I exchanged nervous glances with Allison, until Kate began to address the matter at hand.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I know this must be a little weird, right?" she said, smiling at me.</p>
<p>"That had occurred to me, yes," I replied.</p>
<p>Kate giggled. "Well, sorry about that. I should explain. Basically, Jeremy and I want to have a baby, but he's... um... facing some problems in that department and we need to look for alternatives." Jeremy shifted nervously in his seat, and then glanced over at me. "But it's important to me that any child that I have be conceived, born, and raised naturally. Maybe that's just due to the way I was brought up myself. I don't want to have this done in a lab somewhere, you know?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Anyway, um... we need to find someone who's understanding and sensitive to what we're up against, and can be, you know, quiet about the whole thing..."</p>
<p>"Right, I understand," I added. I could tell Kate was also a little anxious about this whole situation, despite her cheerful nature, and that made me feel a little relieved.</p>
<p>"Great. Also... it's important to me that it not be, like, some stranger that just shows up to... well, you know. I'd like to at least get to know the person we choose a little bit." She glanced over nervously at her husband, then back at me. "I just feel like... if I can't make a baby out of an act of love... I'd like it to feel at least as close to that as possible. Like, through a good friendship, or something."</p>
<p>For a moment, Kate and I just gazed at each other. I knew I was instantly attracted to her, and it sure felt like the feeling was mutual. I couldn't imagine what her husband must have felt in that moment, seeing us interact like this, essentially asking for him to approve what felt like an affair. My heart started racing as she looked at me, expectantly.</p>
<p>"Um... sure, I can totally understand that," I said, trying to break the awkward silence. "I'd probably feel the same way." Kate beamed at me.</p>
<p>Allison chimed in, understanding that things had gotten a little awkward. "Why don't we discuss some of the practical matters, and then you and Jeremy can take as long as you need to discuss, before getting back to me and Nick with a decision."</p>
<p>"Sure, that sounds great," said Kate.</p>
<p>Allison and Kate proceeded to discuss the legal matters, how payment would work, and other details. All of this went fine, especially listening to how I'd be paid handsomely. However, when it came time to discuss how the scheduling of my "sessions" with Kate would work, it quickly became awkward again.</p>
<p>"You and Kate would have to engage in a lovemaking session about every other day, while I track her ovulation schedule," Allison had said. "You'll be using the techniques that I draw up for you, which is nothing usual. For example, we'll want you to use certain positions to enhance the likelihood that pregnancy will occur."</p>
<p>That was the first direct mention of sex. I started to tremble slightly, sitting next to Kate. She kept looking over at me, getting a sense of how I was absorbing this information. This was nothing like I had imagined. In my fantasy, I just showed up from time to time to fuck a cute woman however I liked. This was strict, disciplined, and thoughtfully planned out. I wasn't yet sure how it would go.</p>
<p>Still, as I took my own secret peeks at Kate, I began to wonder if she felt excited about this. I wondered what her body looked like; if it was as impossibly arousing as I already thought it was. I wondered if she was looking forward to seeing another man's penis, beside her husband's, and feeling it inside her. I began to throb in my pants just thinking about the two of us, two complete strangers, embracing each other naked in their bed, and then making love together.</p>
<p>For a moment I had stopped listening, absorbed in these thoughts. I quickly snapped out of it when I heard Kate say, "And you have no problem if Jeremy is there, right?"</p>
<p>I nearly choked.</p>
<p>"Oh, sure, y-yeah, no problem," I stammered. Did she mean that her husband would be in the room while we made love? Would he be watching us? Was this really happening?</p>
<p>Jeremy smirked at me. "Yeah, you know, just to make sure things remain kosher," he said.</p>
<p>"Right, sure, totally," I said, pretending that I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
<p>"Great!" said Kate.</p>
<p>Soon all the practical matters had been discussed, and we decided to leave it there to let Kate and Jeremy discuss it on their own. They offered Allison and I lunch. We couldn't say no, as they had already bought plenty of supplies for a backward cookout. Jeremy got the grill going, and Allison helped Kate in the kitchen.</p>
<p>I offered to help Jeremy, but he said he was all set. After a few moments of awkward silence I finally addressed the real topic on my mind, head on.</p>
<p>"Sorry, uh, for putting you in an uncomfortable position here. With this whole scenario, I mean," I said, slowly stumbling through my statement.</p>
<p>Jeremy smiled, but didn't look up from what he was doing. "No problem. You didn't put me there. I put myself there." He let out a small chuckle that put me more at ease. "But it's okay. This is important to her. To both of us."</p>
<p>"All right," is all I could think to say.</p>
<p>"I'm just going to take a step back and go with the flow," he continued, before finally looking up at me. "Just do what you need to do to make a baby happen, and it'll all be good."</p>
<p>I felt at least a little better knowing that Jeremy wasn't going to punch my lights out the moment I climbed into bed with his wife, and that he was fully conscious of what he was asking me to do. Or what Kate was asking for, anyway. I gave myself permission to forge ahead, without spending so much time worrying about his presence in the matter.</p>
<p>For the next couple of hours, I noticed that Kate wasted no opportunity to chat with me so we could get to know each other better. I felt as if I was on a date, as we excitedly shared childhood stories, discovered mutual interests, and joked around over beers. Jeremy remained a little standoffish, but seemed to be a decent guy. I learned that he ran a small landscaping business. Kate was a teacher and taught a 5th grade class in town. They had been married a couple of years.</p>
<p>All the while I gazed at her, thinking about how lovely she was, how spirited and happy she seemed, how much I wished I had met her first. When it was time to go, Kate seemed sad to see me leave. Jeremy finally waved Allison and I off and we headed out to our cars while Kate watched from the doorway. I had the distinct sense I was going to be approved by Kate, and this sent a rush through my body.</p>
<p>"Wow, okay. That was interesting," Allison whispered to me as we headed down the driveway.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it sure was," I said, still thinking about Kate.</p>
<p>"How did you feel about it? Are you still keen on the idea?"</p>
<p>"It's not as I imagined it," I said, chuckling, "but sure."</p>
<p>Allison smirked. "Okay. Well then let's talk as soon as I hear back from them."</p>
<p>We got into our cars and drove off.</p>
<p>I didn't hear anything at all for a couple days, and then finally my phone rang. It was Allison.</p>
<p>"Hey, what's up? Did you hear back from Kate and Jeremy?" I asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>"Yeah. So it looks like we're on."</p>
<p>"Okay," I said simply, hiding the fact that I was secretly relieved.</p>
<p>"I'm sorta still registering that this is happening..." she said.</p>
<p>"Me too!" I laughed. "I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that he'll... you know... be present."</p>
<p>"Oh, totally. That's gotta be super weird. You know, Kate confided in me that he was confused about this whole thing at first, but she worked on him for a while until he came around."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I can imagine..."</p>
<p>"Anyway, that's not the only... um... thing that's gonna be weird."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Well there's one more wrinkle," Allison said.</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"You know, part of my job is to coach people on ways they can increase their chances of getting pregnant, and I've been doing that with Kate."</p>
<p>"Right, I understand that you'll be explaining about the best positions to use and so forth."</p>
<p>"Exactly. But... they, uh... they want me to be present too. To make sure you're following my recommendations correctly- at least just for the first session." My heart skipped a beat and I didn't say a word. "Um... are you still alive?" Allison asked nervously.</p>
<p>"Seriously? They want you to be there for the first session? You'll be there to watch us have sex?"</p>
<p>"Basically... yeah."</p>
<p>I could hear the nervousness in her voice. Allison and I talked occasionally about our sexual partners, and it was always arousing. She was a beautiful woman, but there happened to have never been anything between us. Now we were faced with a scenario where she'd not only see me naked, but make love to another woman in front of her.</p>
<p>"Do they know we're friends?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, they know. I think they actually think that will make it easier. Maybe she thinks we've been a couple before, or something. I dunno."</p>
<p>"Did you agree to all this?"</p>
<p>"Well... yeah. They put me on the spot."</p>
<p>"Wow, okay."</p>
<p>"Are you okay with it?"</p>
<p>"I guess? Are you?"</p>
<p>"I guess I am too..." Allison said. There was nervous silence for a few moments, before Allison continued. "Anyway, shall I confirm with them that you'll accept and are ready to move ahead?"</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Thus it was established; I was going to fuck this beautiful woman I was inexplicably already having feelings for, while her husband and one of my best friends watched. It didn't seem real to me, but our first "session" was to take place in a matter of days, and it was about to get real, real fast.</p>
<p>"I can't believe I'm doing this," I said to myself, over and over, when the day arrived. At first, all I could think about was dropping my drawers in front of Allison and the expression on her face when she saw my cock pop out. I started blocking this fear by thinking about a wild, exciting romp in the sheets with Kate, but it kept getting obscured with the sight of Jeremy's face, watching us with irritation. I was such a bundle of nerves that I instinctively grabbed a condom on my way out the door, as I usually would when going to see a woman, forgetting that I very specifically was not going to be using them for a while.</p>
<p>The drive felt longer than it was. I cranked up some music, trying to get psyched for what was about to occur, but the nervousness still broke through. I began to feel anxious about whether or not I could perform with such a knot forming in my stomach, but I told myself that it would pass the moment I saw Kate take off all her clothes. I focused on her, and how strangely attractive she was, as a means to get through it all.</p>
<p>I arrived a few minutes late and rushed to the door of Kate and Jeremy's house. After knocking, Kate opened the door and let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>"Ah! Hi Nick. I was starting to get worried," she said, with a sheepish smile. I could tell she was lightly trembling, and seemed more timid than our first encounter. On the other hand, she clearly just had her hair done, making her curls dramatic and soft. She'd taken extra care with her makeup and was wearing a perfume that I immediately was drawn to, as if she knew exactly what would fit my taste. I appreciated the time she'd taken to prepare for the occasion, and found it sweet. Truthfully, I'd done a little of the same.</p>
<p>"Hi, sorry I'm a little late," I said.</p>
<p>"No problem," she replied. Then she whispered, "Are you... ready for this?" She looked up at me, hopeful.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I think so, a little nervous maybe," I admitted.</p>
<p>"Me too," she said with an exhale. "Excited too, though."</p>
<p>We smiled at each other. "Me too," I replied. She beamed. Kate then squeezed me tight, in private, far from the watchful gaze of her husband. She held me close for a few moments and I felt a deep tenderness from her for the first time. I softened in her embrace and held her close. Then we headed out to the living room. I could barely walk with so many butterflies in my stomach.</p>
<p>Jeremy and Allison were waiting for us in the living room, as expected. Jeremy had his arms folded and paced slowly across the floor. One could cut the tension in the air with a knife. When I appeared, he looked up at me and cocked his head thoughtfully. Allison wiped her palms on her jeans and stood up to welcome us.</p>
<p>Everyone exchanged hellos and then I took a seat beside Kate on the coach. Jeremy joined her on the other side. I noticed that Allison had set up a slideshow on her laptop.</p>
<p>She began, "So if you're ready, we'll get started. I'm going to begin by going through the instructions for today's session, and for the sessions that follow."</p>
<p>Allison proceeded to flip through slides, giving us a detailed overview of what we should be doing both on our own and in the bedroom to achieve the desired goal. For example, one of the slides read, "Stay Healthy!"</p>
<p>"At this point I've already given you both a worksheet to track your vitamin intake, especially the prenatal ones. Beyond that, you'll want to suspend exercise, but still remain in shape by watching what you eat and maintaining a healthy body weight. Remember, no drinking if you can help it. But if you cheat now and then, it won't become a serious problem. Nick- remember, absolutely no saunas!"</p>
<p>Each slide was accompanied by discussions about these disciplines we were to follow, or tips to keep in mind. Allison also explained that there were some vaginal lubricants which were generally considered to be fertility friendly, but that they'd agreed to avoid them altogether after determining that Kate "already tends toward being especially lubricated", naturally. This comment caused Kate to turn red. I wondered how Allison had confirmed this matter.</p>
<p>After covering a slide that explained in detail how Kate's six-day fertility window worked, and the subsequent timing of our sessions, Allison finally got into the nitty-gritty, with a slide called, "In The Bedroom."</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Allison said, "Now, we need to talk frankly about what's going to happen in a few minutes when we head into the bedroom together." I shifted nervously in my seat. Kate glanced over at me from the corner of her eye. Allison continued, "It's important that we start with some amount of foreplay. For you, I am recommending that once you're both undressed, you engage in some spooning first. A man's sperm count will be higher if he gets properly aroused first, through some gentle caressing and body contact."</p>
<p>Kate and I nodded stiffly at her.</p>
<p>Allison went on to explain how it was important that I try to follow the mantra "hold off" which meant that I was to prevent myself from ejaculating too quickly, to allow for the best possible "priming of the pump" as she put it. I felt terribly awkward listening to my friend talking about this subject in reference to me. She seemed increasingly nervous herself, and we both knew that she'd be witnessing precisely what she was talking about in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>When the slide flipped, it read, "Pregnancy Approved Positions."</p>
<p>Allison said, "I'm going to recommend two different positions for you to try, both of which will help maximize the chances of pregnancy occurring. First is the classic one: missionary position."</p>
<p>The slide depicted a simple, non-detailed drawing of a couple in this position. Their bodies were a solid tan color, with a thin black outline. The woman had breasts just lightly indicated, with two pink dots for the nipples. The man leaned over her. An erect penis was drawn between his legs, angled between hers, where a pink oval was shown to indicate her open vagina. A red arrow traveled along a dotted path from his penis toward the opening between her legs.</p>
<p>Kate and I chuckled at the appearance of this drawing, and then we shared a smile at each other, which reduced a little bit of the anxiety, at least.</p>
<p>Allison laughed too, and apologized for the simplicity of the drawing. "At any rate," she said, "This is what it should look like. We're going to make one modification, which is to place a small pillow under Kate's pelvis to promote an upward tilt of the vagina, so that Nick's penis can enter her at the best angle."</p>
<p>I gulped, picturing this in my head. The slide flipped to the next position.</p>
<p>"The other position we're going to try is a rear-entry. Kate will kneel and lean forward, while Nick enters her from behind, so that the penis can reach the cervix more easily. We'll try both of these, see what feels good, and decide together when we'd like Nick to ejaculate. Overall, nothing exotic, just the tried-and-true positions for pregnancy."</p>
<p>I began shaking, listening to Allison talking so explicitly about our body parts. I felt as if I was starting to perspire. I looked down and saw that Kate's hand was trembling too.</p>
<p>"Nick, I'm sorry to say- no woman-on-top. You'll definitely be doing all the work here." Kate smirked at me. I chuckled and nodded.</p>
<p>"Lastly, Kate will lie on her back for ten minutes after sex, with her pelvis slightly raised, to give Nick's sperm the best possible chance to do their thing. Is all of this clear?" We nodded.</p>
<p>"All right!" said Allison, with a deep breath, "Whenever everyone's ready, we can head into the bedroom and give this a try!"</p>
<p>My heart started to race instantly. This was it. It was time to do the deed in front of everyone.</p>
<p>Kate stood up quickly. She said, "Okay, just give me a few minutes to get ready. I'll be right back." She hurried off into the house, leaving me sitting next to Jeremy, with a gap between us. Allison stood over us, patiently while I began tapping my foot nervously. No one spoke a word. I dared to look over at Jeremy at one point. He turned and glanced at me, narrowing his eyes and peering at me inquisitively. I quickly looked at Allison, and we stared at each other for a few minutes, our silence speaking volumes.</p>
<p>After what felt like an eternity, Kate returned. "O-okay, ready," she said, her voice briefly quivering. Jeremy quickly stood up and turned to face me. I got up slowly from the couch. Allison gave me a look, as if to check if I was really ready, then gestured to tell me to follow Kate.</p>
<p>I rounded the couch and joined Kate, who seemed to be breathing heavily. She began to walk us through the living room, to the stairs, and upward toward the second floor. Sitting above the bannister along the stairway were several photos of Kate and Jeremy together, apparently on vacation, or posing with family members. In almost all the photos Jeremy was his usual reserved self, while Kate made silly faces, or just smiled happily. I couldn't help but feel they were mismatched. I couldn't help but feel jealous.</p>
<p>By the time we reached the top of the stairs, my heart was beating out of my chest. We turned a corner and walked into the master bedroom. There was a large, king-sized bed. Across from it was a large dresser, covered with jewelry boxes, perfume, and a couple more small photos. A bright stream of sunlight poured in from the bedroom window, illuminating the subtle floral print of the wallpaper. I greedily took in the details of my surroundings, wanting to know everything about Kate's life, and to distract me from the sheer anxiety I was feeling.</p>
<p>Kate took a deep breath in and said, "Okay, here we are."</p>
<p>Allison took control of the situation, saying, "I think the best thing to do would be for Nick and I to leave Jeremy and Kate here for a few minutes. Kate, you should get fully undressed, and get under the covers, then Jeremy can come get us. In the meantime, I will take Nick to the bathroom and let him get ready there. Do you have a robe, maybe? Or a towel?"</p>
<p>Kate nodded. She returned with one of Jeremy's robes. Jeremy peered at us quietly. Kate thrust it forward, and I accepted it.</p>
<p>"That'll work," said Allison. "We'll leave you two then, and just get us when you're ready."</p>
<p>"Okay," said Kate with a nervous sigh.</p>
<p>Allison and I left the room and closed the door behind us. She took me down the hall to a small upstairs bathroom.</p>
<p>"Why don't you get undressed in there, and put on the robe. Then we'll go back to the bedroom together when you're done."</p>
<p>"Okay," I said.</p>
<p>I went into the bathroom and shut the door behind me. Again, I observed my surroundings. Kate's toothbrush was red. She used a fancy European shampoo that looked expensive. She had left a pair of panties in a small hamper. I picked them up and felt how soft they were, then I quickly set them back down the way I had found them and realized I'd better start undressing.</p>
<p>I removed my socks and placed them on the bathroom counter. Then I removed my pants, folded them, and continued building the pile of clothes. I unbuttoned my shirt, then removed it, along with my t-shirt. There I stood in just my boxers, in a strange bathroom belonging to a couple I barely knew. I tried to dismiss the sense of awkwardness, as I slipped down my underwear and stepped out of them, before adding the final piece of clothing to the pile.</p>
<p>I looked at myself in the mirror, naked. Kate's mirror. The one she probably looked at her own naked body in countless times. I looked down at the long, flaccid penis which hung between my legs. I felt instantly insecure, not knowing how attractive Kate would find my body. Not knowing how seeing me naked would affect my relationship with Allison. Not knowing how I'd feel exposing my penis in front of Kate's husband. I quickly slipped Jeremy's robe on and paused before opening the door.</p>
<p>Moments later, I heard Jeremy's voice in the hall. "She's ready," he was saying. With my heart pounding, I opened the door and stepped outside wearing nothing but a soft, black robe.</p>
<p>Allison and Jeremy turned suddenly to see me emerge from the bathroom. Allison instinctively gave me a glance up and down, and I knew that it was fully registering that I was naked under there. Jeremy simply stared at me, then turned and began heading back down the hallway toward the closed door of his bedroom. Allison and I followed.</p>
<p>When we entered the bedroom, Jeremy stepped off to the side and I stopped short. There was Kate laying under the covers, just as Allison had asked. She had them pulled up to her neck, clutching them tightly. We made eye contact and exchanged nervous smiles. I could see how frightened she was, and knew she could see the same in me.</p>
<p>Allison moved further into the room and stepped off to the opposite side of the bed. There she watched Kate and I face each other, coming to terms with what was about to happen. It was clear that no one was going to say anything, so once again Allison had to take the reigns.</p>
<p>"Um... okay, so Nick, whenever you're comfortable, you can go ahead and remove the robe. Just place it on the end of the bed, and we can get started." Like Kate, her voice was quivering. She was, after all, asking me to take my clothes off in front of her.</p>
<p>"Okay," I mumbled. However, I found that I couldn't move for a moment. I felt everyone's stares upon me, upon my body. Especially Kate, who stared out over the sheets at me, waiting to see my naked body.</p>
<p>I slowly undid the belt of the robe, which in my nervousness I had tied with an excessive tightness. I caught the two halves of the robe as they began to part, preventing it from opening before the group, even though delaying this any further was of no use. There was nothing left to do but to remove the robe entirely, and reveal myself nude in front of everyone.</p>
<p>I cast a look at the ground, unable to look at anyone's eyes, as I shyly pulled the robe open and let it fall from my shoulders. Looking down toward my feet, I saw my penis flop out into the open. It was just beginning to become semi-erect, responding to the anticipation at hand, and the rush of air that it met with. I caught the robe as it fell, then stepped forward and deposited it at the end of the bed.</p>
<p>Finally, I dared to look up. First, I saw Allison's eyes. Unsurprisingly, she was staring directly between my legs. Her eyes had widened, and I could see her take a hard swallow. As I stood there watching her observe my cock for the first time, a million thoughts raced through my head. With trepidation, I turned and looked over at Kate. She, too, was gazing directly at my penis. I watched her eyes move about, taking in the sight of my curly cluster of soft brown pubic hair, from which my long shaft extended, then all the way to the thick head, which dangled down well below my testicles.</p>
<p>Watching Kate absorbed in the sight of my cock filled me with an intense mixture of excitement and anxiety. When she finally glanced up at me, our eyes met and she realized that I had caught her staring. Kate turned bright red and bit her lip, but we then exchanged smiles again.</p>
<p>"Um... okay..." said Allison, trying to get ahold of herself. "Kate... you can... uh... lower the sheets now if you like."</p>
<p>Kate's eyes shot over at Allison, terrified. I was equally terrified, as I felt an intense surge of arousal forming within me. I was desperate to see Kate's nude body, but also afraid of getting an erection immediately thereafter, and becoming embarrassed. Like I had, Kate paused for a few moments, trying to work up the courage. Then she finally took a deep breath and began to push the sheets down from her neck, sliding them over her naked body.</p>
<p>I watched with breathless anticipation as the soft, white sheets moved slowly over her skin toward her chest. They began to slide up and over the mounds of her breasts. Then, all of a sudden, Kate's boobs sprang free from the pressure of the sheets bearing down upon her. They were gorgeous, full breasts, with large, dark areolas that stood out dramatically against her fair skin. Her nipples were erect and pronounced. As she continued to reveal herself, I noticed the heavy, liquid movement of her boobs. We had not yet even achieved pregnancy together, but it looked almost as if she was already full of milk out of sheer anticipation, even though I knew this could not be the case.</p>
<p>As I gazed longingly at her beautiful, round breasts, I felt her eyes staring back at me with the same insecurity and arousal that I was feeling. Then I watched as she continued to move the sheets down her body until they reached her navel, which looked deep, dark, and soft. Now I could see Kate visibly trembling as they continued to move forward to reach her groin.</p>
<p>She slowed the advance of the sheets the moment a small bit of pubic hair became visible, then came a little more. Nervously, she continued to move the sheets fully over her genitals, until I saw everything, all at once. Between Kate's legs was a wispy patch of dark brown pubic hair, in a neat little triangle. Beneath that, where the hair began to vanish, I could clearly make out the two pinkish lips of her beautiful pussy, swelling slightly, and puffed up with arousal. She was now showing me all of herself, and witnessing all of me.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Jeremy scanning my face and gauging my reaction to seeing his wife unclothed. However, I was too busy watching Kate as she leaned forward and pushed the sheets the rest of the way, over her legs and past her feet. As she did this, I marveled at the sight of her soft boobs swinging in front of her chest and then settling back into place as she lay back down to watch me nervously. Maybe it was the result of her visible nervousness, but something about her body made her look totally, completely naked, vulnerable, and erotically charged. I suddenly wanted to make love to her so badly that I wanted to scream.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, I was so enamored by the sight of her exposed body that I suddenly felt the throbbing start between my legs. I stood there helplessly as my penis began to quickly swell and grow stiff, long, and hard. It began to rise into the air, reaching out dramatically from my body toward the bed, and toward Kate's nude body. I saw her eyes open wider as she took in the sight of my massive, swollen cock, now twitching before her with anticipation. Allison covered her mouth and looked away, then turned and peeked back at it, fully in a state of disbelief over what she was seeing.</p>
<p>"O-okay, um, Nick, why don't you join Kate in bed now," she said, struggling to find her words.</p>
<p>I nodded and began to circle around the bed on Allison's side. She shot a look down between my legs as I came near. My swollen cock swung heavily in front of my body as I approached Kate's body. She looked up at it with an innocent amazement, her mouth slightly open, her gaze transfixed squarely upon my throbbing penis.</p>
<p>I gently climbed into bed, then moved over Kate's body to the other side, realizing that I didn't want to face Jeremy while we spooned.</p>
<p>Allison continued, "So... we don't have to worry so much about Nick's arousal I guess, since, um, he already has a fully erect penis. But let's go ahead with the spooning and cuddling, to prompt his sperm to get moving."</p>
<p>I scooted my body close to Kate's. As she turned to the side, I caught sight of her beautiful, round bubble butt that I so admired earlier, packed tightly into her jeans. I gingerly pressed my body up against hers. Soon my massive, throbbing erection was buried in the soft canal between her butt cheeks, sandwiched between two mounds of warm, soft flesh. I could feel Kate shiver as she felt it surging and pulsing there. I wrapped my arm around her, then cupped her right breast, gently squeezing it in my hand to feel its soft warmth, as well.</p>
<p>"Mmm," she sighed, softly enough for only me to hear. Together we lay there trembling together in anticipation, until she began to soften and relax into my arms. A sweet, blissful smile formed on her face. I grinned, and buried my face in her neck, inhaling her enchanting scent. I felt myself aching with pleasure against her body as we remained there, pressed together.</p>
<p>"Remember to really enjoy the moment, do what feels right, what comes natural, what expresses how you want to feel when you make a baby together," Allison said, coaching us along and, above all else, trying to reduce our anxiety.</p>
<p>We continued to snuggle together, albeit heavily aware that we were being watched. I continued to caress Kate's breasts, increasingly aroused by the feeling of her hardening nipples under my fingers. She began to squirm slightly. To my surprise, Kate seemed eager to reach back and feel for my erection. I adjusted my body slightly to make it more accessible. She grasped it gently, feeling its hardness in her hand, and then began to stroke it lightly. I softly sighed, expressing enjoyment at her touch. I saw the grin widen on her face as she brew braver, stroking my cock with more enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Allison leaned over and whispered, "Make sure to stimulate her vagina as well, so that she produces the lubrication you'll need."</p>
<p>I could feel my heart beating in my chest, against Kate's back, as my hand traveled down over her breasts, along her stomach, and then over her bellybutton, until I felt the soft hair of her pubic mound against my fingers. She parted her legs slightly to permit me access. As my fingers traveled over her outer labia and separated it slightly, I could feel the humid warmth radiating from her vagina, and knew how aroused she'd already become.</p>
<p>Kate gasped softly as I slid my fingers between the lips of her pussy, then gently rubbed them back and forth. She began to whimper softly as I playfully stroked her labia and circled her clit. I felt myself throbbing even harder in her hand. A small amount of precum began to leak from my penis, making her fingers sticky. This was no surprise, as Allison had forbidden any masturbation immediately prior to our first session.</p>
<p>I plunged my middle finger through the opening of Kate's vagina, and felt it slip smoothly into her slippery canal. She moaned softly and let go of my cock. I moved my finger gently in and out of her pussy, feeling it becoming slick and wet with her juices. I continued to bury my face in Kate's neck, kissing it softly, as we writhed together. Then I pulled my finger out of her and brought my hand up to her shoulder. Discreetly, I inhaled, finding myself intoxicated by the deeply feminine odor of Kate's body, which still emanated from my fingers.</p>
<p>Kate turned slightly so that she could look into my eyes. She gave me a wild, desperate look, and I knew that she was ready; that she was aching for me to proceed and enter her. I shifted to the side to let her move onto her back, then I sat up and moved down her body, preparing to position myself for penetration.</p>
<p>"Let me get the pillow," Allison quickly said, rushing to grab a small pillow that had been left on the night table.</p>
<p>I moved Kate's legs apart and then came to kneel between them. When Allison returned, she came up onto the side of the bed so that she could sit comfortably next to Kate's body. She briefly looked over at me, distracted by the sight of my massive, erect penis, sticking out in front of her face. She regained control, then carefully slipped her hand under Kate's lower back, and prompted her to lift slightly so that she could place the small pillow there. I watched as Kate's legs widened further and her beautiful pussy rose into the air, angled upward toward my face. She gazed at my eyes as I looked at it longingly.</p>
<p>Allison continued to coach us in a quiet, respectful tone, saying, "Okay, Kate, I'm now going to invite Nick to take his penis and insert it into your vagina, and then I want you to tell me if any adjustment is needed to make sure that it enters you at the angle that we discussed." Kate looked up at her with wide eyes and quickly nodded.</p>
<p>I heard Jeremy clear his throat and come closer to the bed, but I couldn't bear to look over at him. Allison gestured to me. I began to shift forward toward Kate's pussy as she began to spread her legs wider for me. Her boobs gently rocked back and forth as her chest began to rise and fall with a quicker pace. We looked deep into each other's eyes, as I prepared to penetrate her for the first time.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>Allison watched closely as I grasped my swinging cock to steady it, then angled my erection at the entrance to Kate's vagina. I began to ease my hips forward, until my penis began to sink into her pink, wet pussy. Kate quickly tensed up and grasped my hand as she felt the sensation of my thick shaft squeezing into her tight canal.</p>
<p>Allison asked, "How does that feel? Does it feel right?"</p>
<p>Kate nodded enthusiastically, while watching my expression. Her face broke out into a big smile, and she laughed, "Yeah."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but laugh as well, and smile back at her. We gazed at each other excitedly, and then turned our attention to the sight of my engorged member tunneling in and out of her pussy. She watched in amazement as I slowly thrust back and forth. Her pussy stretched and squeezed against me, accepting the full length and girth of my aching cock.</p>
<p>I could not believe how amazing it felt. It had been so long since I entered a woman without a condom. The feeling of her slippery, wet flesh against my bare cock sent me into a state of pure bliss. I began to thrust faster, driving my throbbing penis through her hairy, wet pussy as she began to moan.</p>
<p>"Oh god," I couldn't help but mumble, "This feels so good..."</p>
<p>Kate's eyes sparkled as she looked up at me and giggled softly. She began to jerk her hips slightly, thrusting in unison with me.</p>
<p>"Ngh, yes... Nick..." she softly moaned.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of my eye I could see Allison sitting there beside us, trembling herself, watching my cock gliding in and out of Kate's vagina, emerging each time glistening wet from the juices beginning to leak from her pussy. Allison could no doubt smell our arousal, as I could; the heady odor of my swollen penis, and the feminine aroma of Kate's womanhood.</p>
<p>Kate began to moan louder and louder as we frantically fucked each other. I was driven wild by the sight of Kate's sensational boobs which jostled about in response to my thrusts. I clutched them, gently squeezing and teasing her nipples as they wiggled in my hands.</p>
<p>"Oh god! Nick!" she screamed, bucking her hips with pleasure. I groaned at the sight of her intense pleasure.</p>
<p>Allison quickly repeated, "Hold off, hold off," reminding me to keep an orgasm at bay. I wanted so badly to release inside Kate, for us to feel that intense explosion of pleasure together, but I knew that I had to wait.</p>
<p>"Maybe we should try the other position," I said, hoping that the reconfiguration would give me a moment to collect myself. Kate nodded with excitement and allowed me to pull my cock out of her. She flipped over and stuck her round butt up in the air, then leaned forward to place her chest on the bed and spread her knees apart, revealing a lightly hairy, glistening hole.</p>
<p>"Good!" said Allison, "No adjustments needed." She turned to me, smiling, and said, "Go ahead."</p>
<p>I eagerly grasped Kate's soft butt cheeks and thrust my cock forward, plunging it back into her sopping wet pussy. She instantly cried out with pleasure. I threw my head back and groaned at the sensation of my penis buried deep inside Kate's tight canal. I thrust harder, watching her beautiful round ass wobbling as my pelvis collided with it over and over. Allison watched in amazement as my massive cock drove repeatedly into Kate like a piston.</p>
<p>For a moment I lost myself in the supreme bliss of our intense fucking. I listened to the slapping of our bodies as I pounded against her ass. I listened to the soft sucking sound of her messy, wet pussy as it repeatedly received my cock, still aching helplessly for an orgasm that I could not yet allow. When I snapped out of the trance, I finally caught sight of Jeremy. He, too, was deeply engrossed in the sight of my shiny, throbbing erection tunneling into his wife's vagina as she drenched my cock in her cum.</p>
<p>"Oh my god! Oh my god!" Kate screamed as she buried her face in the bed sheets. "Fuck!" she cried out, "... me!"</p>
<p>I curiously looked down at Jeremy's crotch. Sure enough, he had a bulge. He was getting turned on watching his own wife fucking a stranger. I turned my attention back to Kate as I continued to pound her from behind, moaning louder and louder.</p>
<p>"Ngh! How long do I have to wait?! I could come at any time!" I exclaimed, feeling my cock tingling and throbbing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Kate lifted her head and said, "Quick, let's switch back to missionary, and you can come inside me!"</p>
<p>She flipped back over and Allison quickly restored the pillow to adjust my angle of entry again. I resumed thrusting my cock into Kate's hairy pussy, and watching her boobs bouncing joyfully about her chest.</p>
<p>"Yes! Keep going!" Kate laughed excitedly, no longer showing any embarrassment. She resumed her own thrusts, eagerly watching my cock penetrate her in breathless anticipation of my orgasm.</p>
<p>"Oh god, Kate! I can't believe how tight and wet you are!" I exclaimed, briefly forgetting that Jeremy was right beside me.</p>
<p>"Yes! Make me a baby! Come for me! Come inside me!" Kate exclaimed, furiously jerking her hips as our bodies convulsed together.</p>
<p>Finally, I felt a powerful surge of pleasure tear through my body. I drove my penis forward with an intense final thrust before I felt the orgasm take hold. My cock started spasming wildly, and I slowly moved it forward and back as it began to squirt uncontrollably inside Kate's pussy, pumping spurt after spurt of semen into her vagina.</p>
<p>"Oh my god! I can feel you! I can feel you coming inside me!" she cried out.</p>
<p>We gazed longingly at each other as I continued to release inside her, until the spasms began to slow down and then stop. I leaned back, huffing and puffing, ready to collapse beside Kate. I pulled myself out of her, finding my cock soaked in a mixture of each of our secretions. A trail of whitish cum began to ooze from her pussy, and Allison made a slight adjustment to ensure that Kate's pelvis was raised as much as was comfortable. I rolled over to the side and laid next to Kate, where she turned to face me with a big, bright smile.</p>
<p>"We did it!" she whispered.</p>
<p>"Yes, we did!" I whispered back.</p>
<p>She was beaming and gazed up at the ceiling happily, finding a comfortable position where she could relax for the next ten minutes. Allison looked over at me with a smile, which I returned. I'd finally lost any embarrassment I had about being naked and aroused in front of her. I decided to let them discuss what was happening now, and how to proceed with the post-lovemaking steps that Kate was to follow.</p>
<p>I grabbed the robe and threw it on. Jeremy turned to look at me as I headed to exit the room. I couldn't tell if he was upset, or aroused, or what. He just stared at me, as if analyzing my every move.</p>
<p>I made it down the hall and into the bathroom, then closed and locked the door. I took a deep breath, as if it were the first one I'd taken since I'd entered the bedroom. I looked at myself in the mirror and laughed. "We did it," I said, repeating Kate's words. I felt as high as a kite.</p>
<p>Later, Jeremy and I waited downstairs in the living room. He paced back and forth. We wordlessly acknowledged each other, and both breathed a sigh of relief when Allison came down the stairs with Kate, who was now wearing her robe. They were smiling and nodding at each other, as if having just finished a conversation about what had transpired.</p>
<p>"Okay! She's good to go," said Allison. "Remember, you'll repeat this again in two days time, and then two days after that. If you need any more input from me, I'm just a phone call away."</p>
<p>"Thanks Allison!" exclaimed Kate, hugging her.</p>
<p>"No problem," she replied.</p>
<p>Kate's eyes settled on mine, and they generally remained connected until I left. My heart was still throbbing with adrenaline, and a strange, blossoming affection. When Allison had finished collecting her things, we both exited, waving to Kate who hung out in the doorway.</p>
<p>"So wow... that was..." Allison whispered, as we made our way down the driveway.</p>
<p>"... Interesting," I said, completing her sentence. I suddenly had deja vu from the last time we left their house together.</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p>I noticed Allison was still a little too red-faced and embarrassed to look at me. I didn't blame her, given how weird it must have been for her to be such a close observer to my sexual encounter with Kate.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah... yeah- sorry," she laughed. "Just... still processing what I just saw. We've been friends for so long and... you know." She smirked. I smiled at her. "Anyway, let's talk soon. You can... um... tell me how the rest of this goes."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Still smirking, Allison got into her car and pulled away. As I started my car, I looked up toward the house. Kate was still there, with her beautiful dark curls and huge smile. She looked alert when she saw me glance at her, then quickly started waving. I waved back. It was painful to leave.</p>
<p>The following morning I received an unexpected phone call.</p>
<p>"Hi Nick!" Kate said, cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Oh, hey Kate! What's up?" I replied, surprised and excited to hear from her.</p>
<p>"Nothing, just lounging around the house. Jeremy is on job all day in Mount Hope, so I'm by myself today... My life is pretty boring when the students are on summer break. Hey, you wouldn't want to get lunch, would you?" She laughed. "I hope that's not awkward. It's just... weird to have done that yesterday and then part ways, just like that."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, I understand. The whole situation is strange for sure," I laughed, "But I feel the same."</p>
<p>"Do you live far?"</p>
<p>"Nope, about fifteen or twenty minutes away."</p>
<p>"Oh cool, well what do you like to eat?"</p>
<p>"Um... I like to hang out at Rodney's Bar and Grill sometimes."</p>
<p>"Great, I love Rodney's! Want to meet there? Maybe we can do a beer flight."</p>
<p>"Sure! Oh, but wait... we're not supposed to drink, remember?"</p>
<p>"Oh, right," I could almost hear her frowning. "Well, we're allow to cheat a little, right?"</p>
<p>I laughed and said, "Why, yes! Yes we are!"</p>
<p>"Great, it's a date!"</p>
<p>"Excellent!" My heart skipped a beat. Did she really mean to use the word "date"? Deep down I wished it really was.</p>
<p>I raced to Rodney's and grabbed us a seat. Shortly thereafter, Kate arrived. She squeezed me tight and then took a seat.</p>
<p>"Hey, good to see you again," I said, awkwardly. I realized it had been a long time since a woman had made me this nervous.</p>
<p>"Yes!" She looked me up and down. "I'd already forgotten what you look like with clothes on." We both laughed. She turned red, and giggled, "Sorry, that was awkward."</p>
<p>"No problem," I chuckled. Secretly, I felt that her remark was revealing and I was excited to hear her suggest that she might have been thinking about my body, as I was hers.</p>
<p>"Anyway," she began, shaking off the embarrassment from her previous comment, "I appreciate you meeting me here. I just... I dunno... it's important for me to spend a little time with you. To get to know you better. It's just kinda weird to not have a loving relationship with the person who's making a baby with me."</p>
<p>"Even though we're... not married?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I mean... I don't know how to explain. But I'd like to get as close as we can, to at least approximate it." She laughed. "I'm sorry, I don't think I'm making sense."</p>
<p>"No, no, it's okay," I said, reassuringly, "I get it. And I'm happy to do that. Honestly, this whole experience makes me want to feel close to you as well."</p>
<p>"Really?" she said, seemingly relieved.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>Kate beamed at me. We ordered some chicken wings and decided upon a beer flight to share, that way we were at least consuming less alcohol. I found myself having a fantastic time with Kate, a beautiful woman that I was increasingly drawn to, and who naturally didn't want to think of me, the man giving her a child, as a complete stranger. I couldn't help but long for the next moment we'd share in bed together.</p>
<p>Halfway through our "date" she finally addressed the elephant in the room. "Hey, so... how was yesterday?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean, did it go okay for you? I don't even know if you find me attractive," she said with a nervous laugh.</p>
<p>I nearly spit out my beer. "Oh- gosh. It went great... y-you're beautiful!" I scrambled to say. She giggled. "I mean... I'm a guy, so admittedly there's some fundamental excitement to begin with... but, you're really amazing. I'm excited to do this with you." She gave me a deeply affectionate stare all of a sudden, but then caught herself and recovered. I continued, "Are you... comfortable? Was it okay for you too?"</p>
<p>"Oh- yes! You're fantastic!" she said smiling. "And well equipped for the job," she giggled. "I wanted to ask you... um... if you want me to shave or anything? Down there..."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, you don't need to do anything, you're perfect just the way you are," I replied.</p>
<p>We exchanged tender smiles for a while, sipping our beers in perfect silence. I felt like a giddy kid all of a sudden, and felt that she was experiencing the same thing. We began to talk about all sorts of things, further developing our relationship and tightening our bond. Finally, we both realized how much time had passed.</p>
<p>"Yikes, I'd better go," she said.</p>
<p>"Yeah! It's getting late."</p>
<p>I settled the bill and led Kate out to the parking lot.</p>
<p>"That was really fun!" she said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, absolutely, I'd be happy to hang out any time."</p>
<p>"Me too," said Kate, grinning.</p>
<p>I paused awkwardly. I knew it wasn't really a date, but somehow I was still hoping for a kiss. Suddenly, she stepped close to me and planted her lips on mine. I kissed her deeply. When we parted lips, I could see how much she had enjoyed it.</p>
<p>"Don't tell him I did that," Kate said with a smirk.</p>
<p>"Okay," I laughed.</p>
<p>"See you tomorrow, then?" she asked, with a twinkle in her eye.</p>
<p>"Looking forward to it!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Okay. No hanky-panky business 'til then. Gotta save that baby-stuff for me!" she giggled, getting into her car.</p>
<p>"Ugh, I'll do my best," I joked.</p>
<p>We both laughed and I waved her off, then watched her car until it was out of sight.</p>
<p>I spent the following day waiting desperately to get home, shower and change, and then hurry to Kate's for our second session. I cranked the radio on the way there, laughing with disbelief at the fact that I was on my way to fuck a beautiful woman that I was becoming attached to, and who clearly had chemistry of her own with me. Jeremy was as far out of my mind as could be. It was just me and Kate, and infinite possibilities.</p>
<p>The moment I arrived at their house, it was clear that this session was going to be totally unlike the last. Before I could even knock at the door, it swung open and Kate threw her arms around me.</p>
<p>"Welcome back!" she squealed.</p>
<p>"Thanks!"</p>
<p>"How we doin' down here? Primed and ready?" she whispered, slipping her hand casually down to my groin. I could feel myself already getting hard.</p>
<p>"Cocked and loaded!" I replied.</p>
<p>Kate laughed excitedly. I was mesmerized, watching her curls flying in the air. "C'mere," she said, tugging me forward excitedly, before slamming the door shut.</p>
<p>"Hey," said Jeremy, who was standing in the living room with his arms folded.</p>
<p>"Hey," I replied.</p>
<p>Kate turned to me and said, "Okay, I'm gonna get ready. You can head upstairs to the bedroom."</p>
<p>"Will do."</p>
<p>She ran off and I headed upstairs to the bedroom. I heard Jeremy slowly begin to follow once I reached the stairway, but I heard him slip off to the upstairs bathroom first. I walked into the master bedroom and looked around. I saw that Kate had already left the support pillow on the bed. I also saw that the photos on the dresser had been ever so slightly moved. A prominent one of Kate and Jeremy had shifted so as to no longer face the bed. I wondered if this was a coincidence or not.</p>
<p>"Hey there," I heard a voice say behind me. I turned to look and found Kate standing seductively in the doorway in her best pair of lacy bra and panties.</p>
<p>"Good lord," I said, astonished at her beautiful figure.</p>
<p>She laughed, then did a playful catwalk toward me. Her body moved up against mine and we exchanged grins. I felt the zipper of my pants shoot down, then the button popped free. She was clearly feeling frisky, as was I, especially since Jeremy had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>I slipped my hands around to cup her cushy bottom and she pressed her forehead to mine. I squeezed her gorgeous tush excitedly and she let out a laugh. Quickly, she began to unbutton my shirt and then pulled it off. She flung it onto the end of the bed and gave me an impish look as she ran her hands over my bare chest.</p>
<p>Giggling, she quickly ran over to the side of the bed and then turned to face me. I heard Jeremy walking into the room behind me. He cleared his throat, which I now understood was his way of announcing that he was there.</p>
<p>Kate seemed unfazed by his presence. She continued to lock eyes with me, grinning happily as she reached around and began to undo her bra. I heard it release, and then watched as she pulled it off, letting her bare breasts spill out into the open. She giggled at the sight of my widening grin. With exaggerated movements, she cast her bra off to the side, making sure her boobs wiggled dramatically, with their dark, pronounced nipples. Then she hopped onto the bed and laid out flat.</p>
<p>Kate gave me a look, as if expecting something. I knew that she wanted me to join her and remove her panties. But first I grasped the waist of my already loosened pants. Kate gave me an intense, wild stare, straight between my legs, as I stuck my thumbs into my boxers and slid them down as well. My nearly-erect cock popped out and gently bounced in the air. As I gazed at her devilish grin, my excitement and anticipation grew. Within moments my penis swelled into a full-fledged boner and swung about stiffly as I approached Kate.</p>
<p>I quickly climbed onto the bed and began to caress Kate's body. She bit her lip and watched me curiously as I looked down at her black, lacy panties. I began to tease her, gently massaging her labia through the delicate fabric between her legs. She exhaled and began to moan softly. After a little while, I could feel the fabric beginning to grow damp. I grasped the band of her panties and began to slide them down over her long legs, and watched in amazement as her beautiful pussy began to appear.</p>
<p>"Remember!" squealed Kate, "Foreplay first!"</p>
<p>"I haven't forgotten!" I exclaimed. I playfully buried my face between Kate's full breasts and inhaled deeply, intoxicating myself on her perfume, the same selection as before. She giggled and squirmed beneath my weight. I moved to her nipples, which stood at attention, and began to suckle playfully.</p>
<p>"Oh! Um..." I heard Kate saying, and felt her glance over my shoulder at Jeremy. I suddenly realized maybe I had crossed a line. He was still expecting us to do the bare minimum; that I was supposed to engage in basic caresses, insert my penis inside Kate, ejaculate as quickly as possible, and be done with it. Logic dictated that we weren't supposed to make any extra fun of the experience. However, before I could react, I felt Kate turn back to me, enjoying the sensation of my tongue against her hardened nipples. I realized that Jeremy must have seemed okay with it. Okay enough, anyway.</p>
<p>I decided to enjoy the freedom I was risking. I sucked and teased her nipples hungrily, greatly aroused by the sight of Kate's large breasts as they jostled about, responding to my playful nipping. Kate was vocal about her enjoyment, alternating between laughs and soft moans. When I had finished, I caught her grinning at me with a sinister look in my eye.</p>
<p>"Uh oh, I know that look..." I chuckled.</p>
<p>"Oh you're gonna get it now," she snickered, pushing me back onto the bed. I landed on the sheets and felt my cock spring up in the air. Kate crawled forward and grasped it firmly. She gave me a teasing look before she began to apply long, slow strokes up and down the full length of my shaft.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"How's this for foreplay, hmm?" she asked, as I started to groan. "I'm going to make your penis niiice and hard..." She giggled and started pumping me quickly, adding twists, and changing up her speed and pressure.</p>
<p>"Jesus..." I moaned, as I felt myself becoming fully engorged, fiercely throbbing in response to her strokes. I looked up at her. Kate's face was right in front of my massive, erect cock, which she remained transfixed on with utter fascination, watching it twitch and pulse with pleasure. I so badly wanted her to suck it, but I knew for sure that would not go over well with Jeremy.</p>
<p>I nervously glanced over at him as he slowly made his way around the far end of the bed. In a concerned tone, Kate whispered, "Is it making you uncomfortable that he's here?"</p>
<p>"It's a little weird, but don't worry about it," I whispered back.</p>
<p>"Just pretend he's not here. It's just you and me," she said, smiling warmly. I nodded.</p>
<p>"Oh god, Kate," I soon groaned, "That feels amazing."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?" she laughed, becoming increasingly animated in response to my excitement. Her boobs danced about excitedly with the force of her strokes, and as I watched them wagging in front of her chest it only enhanced my pleasure tenfold.</p>
<p>"How about this?" she said, scooping her breasts together and leaning forward. She sandwiched my cock between them and began to move up and down, letting my hard shaft slip back and forth between her soft skin. It tunneled through her cleavage, until my swollen head stuck out and reached for her chin, then it slipped back down between her breasts and vanished again. Over and over she massaged my cock with her breasts, watching my reactions with sheer amusement.</p>
<p>I was shocked at how playful and frisky she was starting to become, with her husband standing just a few feet away. I wondered if she didn't get the adventure out of him that she desired in the bedroom. Out of the corner of my eye I could see him shifting nervously, watching both of us from his stiff standing position. I began to worry that they'd get into a fight after I left; that he'd blow up at Kate, and make her upset. But then I decided that he agreed to all this; that this is what Kate wanted, and we had every right to follow Allison's directives, which was exactly what we were doing.</p>
<p>Kate stopped massaging my cock when she saw how pleasured I'd become. She sat back on the bed, sitting cross-legged, revealing her hairy crotch and swollen breasts, still full of amusement and excitement.</p>
<p>"Now what?" she said, smirking. She reached forward and gently cupped my balls. "Are the boys suitably full?"</p>
<p>I laughed. "There's only one way to find out!"</p>
<p>Kate squealed happily as I flung apart her legs and let her fall back onto the bed sheets. I marveled at her glossy, pink inner flesh as her hairy pussy spread apart. Kate briefly closed her eyes and moaned as I stroked my fingers along her inner thigh and watched her quiver with anticipation. Then I began to playfully stroke her labia, teasing it gently and feeling her begin to moisten.</p>
<p>"Ready?" I asked, grinning.</p>
<p>"Yes! Get that sucker inside me!" she laughed, eyeing my massive erection.</p>
<p>Kate reached down and spread her labia further apart, revealing her deep, wet hole and inviting me inside. I scooted the support pillow under her back, then positioned my swollen cock before her vagina. I moved my hips forward, pushing with effort into her tight canal. Kate's eyes widened suddenly and she quickly inhaled.</p>
<p>"Oh, does that hurt?" I asked.</p>
<p>Kate gave an embarrassed laugh. "No, no! It's just - ngh - that your penis is so thick when it's erect. I'm not used to it... but it feels really good!"</p>
<p>I chuckled. "Okay, good." It didn't occur to me until later that she inadvertently dissed her husband in that moment, without realizing it. Jeremy crept closer to the bed. I could hear him breathing deeply.</p>
<p>Kate and I locked eyes as I hulked over her, slowly moving my cock in and out of her pussy until she became adjusted to my girth. Soon I found her thrusting her own pelvis forward, excitedly trying to increase her own pleasure. She grasped my butt, pressing me forward, forcing me to plunge my cock deeper inside her as she moaned loudly.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, Nick!" she cried out. "I'm so wet! I'm so wet for you!"</p>
<p>She gazed down at her pussy in amazement as it squeaked and oozed all over the place. What Allison had said was right; Kate was especially forthcoming in that department. Each time my cock partially withdrew from her pussy, I found it absolutely glazed in her slick cum which was beginning to make her entire pubic area sloppy and soaked.</p>
<p>Jeremy timidly inched his way closer to the bed, then rested one side of his body on the edge, settling into a seated position. I snuck secret looks at him. He began to tour his wife's body with his eyes, first absorbed in the sight of her large breasts bouncing joyfully upon her chest as we fucked, and then moving down to take a close look at my throbbing cock grinding inside her pussy, making her increasingly a mess from our mutual pleasure.</p>
<p>"H-how does that feel?" Jeremy finally said, as his voice briefly broke.</p>
<p>Kate looked up at him in surprise. "Oh- good," she said. We continued to fuck, unsure what to make of his sudden break from silence. A few moments later, he spoke up again.</p>
<p>"You're absolutely soaking. Remember that time I made you squirt?" he said, feeling slightly bolder.</p>
<p>Kate's eyes widened in surprise, then she smirked. "Yeah," she said, nodding to him.</p>
<p>I glanced at Jeremy curiously. He appeared to be getting off on this. All this time I had been thinking he was going to be angry, but he seemed to actually enjoy the sight of a stranger fucking his own wife. I felt a rush, and began to drive my hard cock harder and harder through the sloppy, hairy entrance to his wife's wet pussy. He gazed in wonder at the sight of my shaft gliding in and out of her, listening to the slippery, fluid sounds she made. As he crept closer, I could see the bulge in his pants, establishing total confirmation of his excitement.</p>
<p>Jeremy reached forward and began to caress Kate's jerking boobs, saying, "You're doing great, honey. Take that hard cock deep inside you, make him come..." Though still showing signs of reservation, he seemed lost in his own world, as if succumbing to the building fantasy of seeing Kate and I in a fit of passion.</p>
<p>"Mgh! Yes!" Kate cried out, first staring into her husband's eyes, and then mine. She seemed to be both surprised and turned on by Jeremy's arousal, and from the expression on her face I could tell that it was growing rapidly. Kate appeared as if pleading with me to make her climax. I pressed against her parted thighs, pumping my cock inside her with growing urgency, struggling to maintain my own sense of control.</p>
<p>"Ngh! Ngh! Nick!" Kate finally began to scream. "I'm going to have an orgasm!" She grasped my arms and began to flick her hips rapidly in unison with mine. Her nostrils flared, and she looked like a bull about to charge. "Yes! Oh god- Nick!" she wailed as an intense orgasm struck. I felt her entire body quake and send tremors through my arms which she squeezed with passion. "I'm coming!"</p>
<p>Kate released a flood, soaking my cock and dripping all over the sheets, which began to turn translucent with the large, wet stain that formed. I pulled out of her pussy, preparing to give her a short break, as she tried to regain her senses after the powerful release. Jeremy moved his hand down her body and slipped it between her legs. I was surprised to see that he drove his fingers between her lips, dousing them in her creamy wetness.</p>
<p>Kate looked up at the two of us in bewilderment and amusement.</p>
<p>"Doggy style?" I said.</p>
<p>Kate grinned and quickly nodded, then I helped her flip over. She stuck her ass up in the air and spread her knees to either side. I watched as her stance widened, permitting full access to her pussy. Kate's light tuft of pubic hair was slick and wet, glistening with her own secretions. She glanced back at me, giving me a desperate look, aching for me to reenter. I grasped the cheeks of her butt and pushed my cock back inside, watching her inner labia part and engulf my cock as it slid deep into her satiny pink canal.</p>
<p>I began to grind against her, watching my cock glide smoothly inside and out as her tight pussy stretched and clung to my shaft, smearing it with her creamy, feminine juices, which showed no sign of letting up. Jeremy sat beside us, watching my pelvis slam against her buttocks, causing her cheeks to undulate and wobble. We both listened to the loud smacking sounds as I drove inside her again and again. The air filled with the smell of her raw, feminine arousal and the heady, masculine scent of my cock as we pounded together in a furious fit of lust.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, it feels so good! I can't stand it!" Kate wailed, as I began to feel a surge coming on. I was reaching my limit, and wanted nothing more than to feel the joy of release inside her once again.</p>
<p>Jeremy was breathing rapidly, powerfully turned-on by the sight of his wife so full of passion and pleasure. He gazed down at the sight of her swinging boobs which moved like pendulums beneath her chest, brushing her dark, erect nipples against the soft bed sheets. Jeremy began to rub her back gently, and then she buried her face in the mattress which muffled her cries of pleasure.</p>
<p>When she came up for again again, it was to announce a second torrent of pleasure. "Oh, fuck- Nick! Fuck! Fuck meee!" she screamed as her head swung about, sending her curls flying. "I want to feel you shoot your load inside me again!"</p>
<p>That was all I could bear to hear, before I felt a tingling sensation rise within me and then explode throughout my body. I rammed my pelvis with one final, loud smack against Kate's soft ass, before I began shooting a flood of semen deep inside her. Moaning, I grasped her butt helplessly as the spasms came one after the other. I felt my cock throbbing wildly within her wet canal as I continued to pump it full of ejaculate.</p>
<p>"Oh my god! Yes!" Kate exclaimed joyfully, feeling me coming inside her. She began laughing with excitement while I finished. I pulled out, leaving a milky-white, hairy mess behind, then I collapsed along side her to catch my breath. She lowered herself to the bed and rolled over, scooting close to my side. We laid there together in a state of bliss. I felt her fingers search for mine in the slight gap between our bodies. She squeezed my hand tight, and I looked over to see her smiling blissfully.</p>
<p>Jeremy began to caress his wife's body again, smiling himself. We remained like that for the full ten minutes of Kate's post-coital procedure, then got up to get dressed.</p>
<p>I felt sad leaving Kate the first time, but this time was even worse. I wanted to lay there in bed with her all day, but once again I had to face the fact that it was time to return to real life. The frustration was immense.</p>
<p>It soon became clear that I was not the only one having difficulty dealing with this new relationship. As before, I received a call from Kate the following morning.</p>
<p>"Hey there," she said, sounding melancholy.</p>
<p>"Hi Kate, what's new?"</p>
<p>"Bored again," she laughed. "I'm not being a bother, am I?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely not," I laughed. "Is Jeremy still working on site today?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, as usual," she grumbled.</p>
<p>"Want me to come keep you company?" I quickly asked.</p>
<p>"Yes! My thoughts exactly."</p>
<p>"Okay! I'll be right there," I said.</p>
<p>I made it to Kate's house in record time and hurried inside. It was fun arriving at her place when Jeremy wasn't around. It felt like there was risk to it. Like we were doing something covertly. In a way, we were, since he had no idea we were meeting during non-scheduled session times. However, it was easy to brush off, since we already had license to fuck anyway.</p>
<p>We flopped down on the couch together. I offered to rub Kate's feet. She seemed thrilled, laid down, and placed them in my lap. Kate had beautiful toes.</p>
<p>"So that was interesting, yesterday..." I said, burning with curiosity.</p>
<p>"What? Making love?"</p>
<p>"Jeremy, I mean. The way he sort of... got involved..."</p>
<p>"Oh! Yeah..." she said, smirking.</p>
<p>"Did he say why he did that?"</p>
<p>"Did you talk about it?"</p>
<p>She laughed. "No..."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I was as surprised as you were."</p>
<p>"Huh. And he wasn't mad about me, uh, you know... taking your nipples in my mouth?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he didn't say anything about it. The only thing he ever mentioned, before this whole thing started is..."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Um... that he doesn't want... another man's penis in my mouth. Or for you to go down on me."</p>
<p>"Ah. I was wondering. How do you feel about that?"</p>
<p>She shrugged. "I dunno. I sorta feel like that's part of sex, so I don't see why it can't be a part of our foreplay. I guess he's just a little jealous?"</p>
<p>"Right... I suppose I can understand how he'd only want us to do the absolute minimum required to get you pregnant." Kate seemed thoughtful. "What's up?" I added.</p>
<p>"Well... I understand his reluctance but, I mean, that's what people do when they make love together. I kinda feel like we're not fully sharing ourselves in the way that I want with my partner in this." She sighed. "Besides, Jeremy rarely goes down on me. I get it on my birthday and such. I think he doesn't totally like it, and yet he expects a blow job from me all the time."</p>
<p>"Really?" I asked, appreciating that Kate was opening up to me about her sex life with Jeremy.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Weird, I love it."</p>
<p>"Going down on a woman?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, totally."</p>
<p>Kate's face lit up. She hesitated for a moment, then cautiously asked, "Well, would you... be willing to eat my pussy? Since he's not here?" I could tell she was almost embarrassed to ask.</p>
<p>I grinned. "Of course!" She sighed with relief and then grinned back at me. I patted her on the butt to indicate that she should get up, and she sprang off the couch excitedly.</p>
<p>Within an instant, we were both pulling off all our clothes until we stood before each other naked in the living room. I gazed at Kate's gorgeous, nude body before she ran up to me and threw her arms around me. She pressed her body forward, burying her soft breasts against my chest, then began to kiss me deeply. I felt myself becoming hard and pressing firmly against her belly as our tongues explored one another.</p>
<p>When we released, I asked, "Ready?"</p>
<p>She grinned and bit her lip, then nodded. I led Kate to the couch and sat her down, then parted her legs and prepared to kneel down before her.</p>
<p>"Wait-" she said, abruptly, "Not here." Kate got up and led me to the easy chair in the corner. "Here. This is Jeremy's chair," she said, with a wicked grin forming on her face. I laughed.</p>
<p>She threw herself down in the chair and flung her legs apart, exposing herself fully to me. Her eyes sparkled with excitement as the prospect of being eaten, which apparently came about so rarely. I knelt down on the rug in front of her and leaned in close, shaking with anticipation. For two sessions I had been intoxicated with her scent from afar, but had yet to enjoy her womanhood up close. I wanted badly to taste her, and to offer her all the pleasure I could in this manner.</p>
<p>I placed my nose close to her labia as it stretched apart, and enjoyed her divine odor, then I dragged my tongue up through her delicate folds, tasting for the first time the creamy wetness that she had a tendency to be so generous with.</p>
<p>"Oooh goood, yeah," she droned, as she felt my tongue begin to explore her private areas.</p>
<p>I tickled all around her labia, and danced across her clit, feeling Kate squirming in her husband's favorite chair. Then I began to suck at her lips, causing her to flinch with pleasure. I spread her pussy with my fingers to gain access to every inch of her velvety, pink flesh, exploring every nook and cranny with my tongue until she was soaking. Finally, I targeted her clit, now protruding and tingling with pleasure. I flicked back and forth across it, enjoying the sound of her gasps and moans.</p>
<p>"Jesus, Nick! Oh my god, what are you doing to me?" she laughed as her body began to tremor. I felt my face becoming drenched in her liquid emissions, and she bucked her hips so strongly that she practically mashed my face against her slick, wet pussy.</p>
<p>After she could take no more, I leaned back and looked at Kate's face. She was overwhelmed with joy and appreciation, so much so that it began to fuel a mad lust. "Get over here, switch with me."</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm gonna suck your dick. On Jeremy's chair. I don't care if he doesn't like it. I want to taste you too." She was grinning wildly.</p>
<p>"Hell yeah!" I exclaimed, switching places with Kate. As I threw myself down in the seat, my cock sprung to life and bounced happily in front of her eyes. She squealed happily at the sight of it; massive, hard, and throbbing, then grabbed at it to stop it from swinging about. She gazed at my erect penis with wide eyes before leaning in and running her soft tongue over my balls and slowly up my shaft to the very tip.</p>
<p>Kate licked her lips and eyed me seductively. "God, I love your cock," she groaned.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?" I laughed.</p>
<p>"Mmm hmm," she said, nodding and eying it hungrily. She went in with urgency, swallowing me completely and beginning to suck wildly, as if she'd been desperate to do this. I groaned at the sight and sensation of my cock gliding in and out of her mouth, becoming coated and wet with her saliva. Her soft tongue massaged my shaft and head with expert precision. I continued to moan, making my pleasure known.</p>
<p>She briefly let me pop out of her mouth, where I continued to twitch and throb in the cool air. "See that, Jeremy?" she said aloud, "I'm sucking Nick's huge dick in your chair!" We both started laughing. "So much for not having another man's penis in my mouth!" It was incredibly erotic and amusing to see Kate comfortable enough to air all her sexual frustrations in front of me, and for us to face them together.</p>
<p>She went back in for a second helping, filling the air with the sounds of smacking lips and wet sucking sounds until I began to writhe with such intense pleasure that I had to beg her to stop. "Careful! Remember I need to save myself for tomorrow."</p>
<p>She laughed. "Sorry, I got carried away." Kate stood up and pulled me out of the chair, then squeezed me tight. We stood in the center of the room, holding each other close. "Tell me- what else do you want. I want to share everything with you," she whispered into my ear.</p>
<p>"Hmm... well..." I said, smirking.</p>
<p>She grinned at me. "Tell me! I want to know."</p>
<p>"Okay. I can't help but wish we could try some different positions, not just the ones Allison prescribed. Specifically... I kinda wish you could ride me," I admitted. "Not that I don't love the positions we're using, but variety is the spice of life."</p>
<p>Kate giggled. "Your wish is my command," she said.</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Really!"</p>
<p>I quickly threw myself down on the couch, laying lengthwise with my throbbing cock sticking straight up in the air. She giggled as she climbed on top of me, straddling her legs to either side of my body. She lowered her butt and I felt the pressure of her body press down upon mine as my cock sunk deep inside her.</p>
<p>"Mmmmm..." she moaned as it penetrated her liquid depths.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, that feels so good," I muttered.</p>
<p>She grinned and gazed down at me, then placed her hands gently on my chest and began rocking back and forth, forcing my cock to tunnel back and forth through her warm, slippery hole. Slowly she began increasing her speed, until she was gently bouncing up and down. Her soft breasts bounced loosely before my eyes and I gazed up at her dancing nipples in wonder. She reached up, stretching her arms over her head and then ran them through her long, beautiful hair, laughing joyfully as she rode my cock.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>"It's so wonderful!" she laughed.</p>
<p>Groaning, I grasped at her bouncing tits and squeezed them happily, then felt them jiggling against my palms as she moved rhythmically against my body. I slid my hands down along the side of her body and continued to moan, overwhelmed with the pleasure of her passionate riding. Seeing how much I enjoyed the sight of her bouncing breasts, she shook her torso playfully back and forth, making them sway dramatically before my eyes.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ, they're beautiful," I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"They're all yours," she said with a devilish grin. Kate leaned forward and let her boobs spill over my face. I buried my nose in her cleavage and rubbed my face back and forth as she continued to gyrate her hips against mine. When she let me come up for air, she saw my blissful expression and laughed.</p>
<p>"I love what you do to my body..." she teased. "I love to see you admiring my boobs. I love feeling your hard cock inside me, and how wet you make me." She began laughing. "No one's ever done the things you do to me before!"</p>
<p>"Kate..." I moaned breathlessly, "I don't want this to stop... I've never been with anyone like you..." I saw her face light up and her chest swell with excitement. She began to ride me faster. The beautiful, dark brown curls of her hair began to cling to the side of her face as our sweaty bodies continued to writhe together in a state of mutual ecstasy. I continued to watch her nipples lurch and swing over me until Kate saw me begin to lose control.</p>
<p>"Ohhh god!" I groaned. She suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>"Wait, wait, don't come inside me!" she laughed. "Save that for tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"Ugh," I exclaimed, throwing my head back with disappointment.</p>
<p>She giggled. "I'm sorry!"</p>
<p>"I know, I know," I laughed. "It's so hard, though!"</p>
<p>"I have an idea," she said, giving me a naughty grin. "I'm feeling... dirty. I think it's time for a shower."</p>
<p>"Bring it on," I exclaimed, enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Kate giggled and hopped to her feet, then began to hurry toward the stairs. I followed, as if trying to catch her. She squealed and tried to escape my grasp. It was a joy to chase her through the house, naked, letting everything hang out. When we reached the bathroom, I didn't bother to even close the door. Kate quickly turned the water on and stepped in. I climbed in after her.</p>
<p>"Mmm..." she moaned, as the warm water came raining down over our bodies. She pulled me close and I wrapped my arms around her. Kate buried her face in my neck and sighed softly. After a few moments of enjoying the sensation of the water streaming down between us, she lifted her face and kissed me. We kissed passionately for a long time, soothed by the warmth of the water and each other's naked body.</p>
<p>I could hear her breathing rapidly, and sensed the erotic thrill she was receiving from this experience. I pinned her against the wall and she gave me a wild, dirty look. I lifted one of Kate's legs and moved it to the side, then eased my hips forward and entered her again.</p>
<p>"Oh god, yes," she cooed, feeling my cock slipping back inside her.</p>
<p>I slowly gyrated my hips against her, fucking Kate slowly and sensually against the pink wall tiles, while watching the rivulets of water snake down her chest and vanish into the hollow between her breasts. As we moved together rhythmically, I could see Kate slipping into a dreamlike state of absolute bliss, until finally she could stand no more and frantically pressed her lips against mine once again, overwhelmed with emotion.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, she whispered, "Hey, can I confess something to you?"</p>
<p>"Of course," I said.</p>
<p>"I feel bad about what I said earlier. Joking about what I was doing to you, in spite of Jeremy. I don't really want to exclude him from whatever we are. I'd rather he just understand my desire for... broader experiences."</p>
<p>"I can understand that," I said. "There are a lot of people like you. Men and women. Who want a marriage, but also want more, from other people. Plenty of couples make that work."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Really," I said.</p>
<p>She seemed thoughtful, and didn't reply.</p>
<p>I held her close under the steady stream of water, feeling like I never wanted to leave her embrace. But as before, a good thing eventually had to come to an end.</p>
<p>The following day's session couldn't come fast enough. After our little escapade left me aching for a release that I could not have, I was looking forward to another encounter more than ever. However, our third lovemaking session was strikingly different.</p>
<p>Kate and I were both on a high from our mutual chemistry, to the point that Jeremy might as well not have even been there. Kate dared to give me a kiss in his presence when I arrived, signaling right away that things had evolved even further. Rather than feel shocked, I went along with it, immediately indicating my readiness for a torrid fuck. While Jeremy seemed taken aback at first, he also went with the flow, watching us tear off our clothes before we even left the living room, and run up the stairway bare as the day we were born, already in a state of full arousal.</p>
<p>"There it is, there's the cock that's going to make me a mommy," Kate squealed, turning to face me upon reaching the bedroom. She grasped my erection and began to stroke it happily. I was already leaking in anticipation of her body. I grinned and cupped her breasts, then planted kisses all over them before working my way up to her neck. We walked backward together until we collapsed onto the bed together.</p>
<p>Jeremy watched with curious interest as we began to stroke and caress each other's body with more enthusiasm than ever. As before, he sat at the edge of the bed, this time smirking slightly, watching the two of us lost fully in each other's presence. Before long, Kate and I launched into our most aggressive, lustful fuck yet. While we continued to obey his rules forbidding oral sex, we nevertheless made no secret of our feverish desire for each other.</p>
<p>"Je-sus!" she wailed, "Nick!" I grunted as I drove my penis inside her with wild enthusiasm. Kate began laughing. "I can't get enough of your massive, fucking cock. I think I'm addicted!" she joked.</p>
<p>"You and me both!" I groaned. "I love that sweet pussy of yours!" Inside I laughed at how free we'd become sharing our feelings openly despite her husband's presence.</p>
<p>Kate's breasts bounced rhythmically on her chest as I felt her creamy wetness tug at my cock with a fierce suction. I was dizzy with pleasure, intoxicated on her feminine odor and my musky scent intermingling as our bodies moved together. A raw, fierce lust burned in our eyes as we stared each other down, feverishly grinding our bodies together in unison as if daring the other to endure the kind of intense pleasure we knew we could provide. I'd never been so horny and in touch with my animalistic urges than I was in that moment, sensing that the thrill, the intensity, and the madness was entirely mutual, cherished equally by each other.</p>
<p>I pressed Kate's knees back toward the bed and leaned against her, urging my cock as deep as it could possibly go, until I could feel her warm breath against my neck, wrapping me with her trembling arms to pull me as close as humanly possible.</p>
<p>At some point our little bubble became suddenly crowded, as Jeremy reached forward and caressed his wife's face. I got a sense from his expression that he was suffering a great deal of arousal that he felt unable to do anything about. To my surprise, he finally let out a frustrated sigh and unzipped his pants. Tugging them down, I caught sight of his erect penis springing free. He frantically grasped for Kate's hand and guided it to his cock, gesturing as if to tell her to stroke it.</p>
<p>Kate showed surprise, but nevertheless began to pump his cock sympathetically and with an amused expression until he began groaning. I continued to fuck her as she leaned to the side and slipped his penis into her mouth, bobbing her head back and forth to suck it and give him the pleasure he couldn't stand to resist any longer.</p>
<p>What seemed awkward to me at first, soon became strangely arousing, seeing Kate sucking her husband's cock while I penetrated her pussy. The three of us continued to exchange pleasure in this manner until Kate gestured that it was time to flip over. Once I began driving my cock inside her from behind, Jeremy leaned back and began to frantically stroke his own while watching his wife's breasts swing back and forth like pendulums.</p>
<p>Kate seemed wildly aroused by the sight of his masturbation, inspired by our intense fucking. Yet she continued to scream my name. "Oh fuck! Nick! Right there!" she shouted as if I had struck her g-spot. Before long she was once again begging me to fill her with my cum, and I was nearing the point where I could not help but comply.</p>
<p>"Oh god, I'm going to come so hard!" I shouted.</p>
<p>"Yes! Fill me now! I want all your cum!" she squealed.</p>
<p>The dam burst and I began setting loose the most relentless flood of semen yet, such that Kate could barely keep it all contained inside. I labored over her body, arching my back and jerking my hips forward as the spasms came so hard and so relentlessly that it was nearly more than I could bear. I fell backward, limp and exhausted, amazed at the sight of her flushed, oozing pussy. After pulling out, my cock still twitched and issued small spurts of white fluid, as if it would go on forever.</p>
<p>As if nothing at all had happened, Jeremy tucked his erection back into his pants and hopped off the bed, then helped me flip Kate over onto her back to the position prescribed to her by Allison. I tried to gauge her reaction. Was she disturbed by her husband's sudden participation? Did it ultimately please her? I couldn't tell much, but she seemed perfectly satisfied in her current state, and with the apparent lack of conflict between myself and her husband.</p>
<p>"Shit," Kate suddenly whispered, as I crawled to her side.</p>
<p>"What?" I replied.</p>
<p>"I just realized... this is the end of my fertile window." She pouted.</p>
<p>"Oh, right." I dawned on both of us that if I successfully got her pregnant, we'd have to stop. If I didn't get her pregnant, we'd still have to stop until the next cycle, which seemed an unbearably long time to wait.</p>
<p>We laid there in silence, contemplating the matter. Again, our time together ended on a melancholy note, and concern for the unknown future that lay ahead.</p>
<p>Days passed and I hadn't spoken to Kate. I half expected to talk to her every day, since that was the trend so far. I found myself checking my phone constantly, to see if I had missed her call, but there were no such notifications. I had just worked up the nerve to call her myself, when finally the phone rang out of the blue. I glanced over and saw her name flash across the screen.</p>
<p>"Hey!" I said excitedly, pressing the phone to my ear. "I was hoping you'd call."</p>
<p>"Hi Nick. Ha, yeah I missed you too," she replied. While she still seemed her usual upbeat self, there was a noticeable reduction in her high-spiritedness that I was more than able to observe, given the solid bond that had formed between us. "What are you up to today? Wanna meet up for a few?"</p>
<p>"Sure, I can swing by your place after lunch."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm in town today. Can you meet me at the Starbucks?"</p>
<p>"Oh, okay. Say, one-o'clock, then?"</p>
<p>"That sounds great."</p>
<p>I quickly grew nervous. I could tell something was up, but I wasn't sure what. I made my way out to a rushed lunch, then into town to find a seat at the cafe. I began slowly sipping a black coffee while searching for any sign of Kate. A few minutes later she strolled in, then made eye contact with me. Her face lit up and she waved, then gestured to wait a moment while she got a drink.</p>
<p>I watched her move through the room, along the line to the cashier to get her latte, and then toward my table. She was the most beautiful woman in the room, and I felt as if everyone was thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>"Hey there," she said, taking her seat in front of me.</p>
<p>"Hi!" I said, taking a large gulp of coffee.</p>
<p>"So- big news," she said with a slight smile.</p>
<p>"Yep..." she seemed to be stalling, then gave a small laugh when she saw me observing this. "I'm... pregnant," she said, exhaling deeply. "We did it."</p>
<p>"Oh! That's great!" I quickly said.</p>
<p>I knew this day was coming. Granted, I immediately began suppressing the selfish disappointment that it couldn't have taken just a little longer, to afford us more time together, but I couldn't think of that yet. I was genuinely happy for Kate. I wanted her to have everything that she desired, but deep down I felt the heartbreak lingering on the horizon.</p>
<p>"Yeah!" she said, smiling again before taking another sip of coffee. "I couldn't wait for the home testing window so I rushed to get my blood results." She seemed quiet and thoughtful. I looked at her curiously.</p>
<p>"You're okay, right? This is what you wanted..."</p>
<p>"Oh, absolutely!" she said, sitting up erect. "I can't wait to be a mommy!" She beamed. "It's just that... I've been enjoying us. What we have. Whatever it is." I nodded with understanding and sighed. "And I feel like we can't have it anymore after this. I guess that's leaving me a little... confused."</p>
<p>This hit me like a ton of bricks. We were both on the same wavelength, but I was doing my best to avoid thinking about it. There was just no way to do that now.</p>
<p>"Nick? Are you there?" she said, observing my silence.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, sorry. I guess I had been trying not to think about it, but I feel the same way."</p>
<p>"I'm glad you feel the same," she said, taking my hand. "What should we do?" She gazed into my eyes. Hers were beginning to turn wet and shiny.</p>
<p>I thought for a moment, reflecting back at our time together; at our increasingly adventurous lovemaking sessions, at the absolute joy we felt when we were together, and even at the awkwardness of Jeremy's presence when we were in bed together.</p>
<p>"Listen..." I said, "I didn't want to get too deep into this earlier, because I didn't want to make you uncomfortable, but... have you ever had the feeling that Jeremy kinda... enjoys what we're doing, also?"</p>
<p>Kate laughed, "I've noticed that, but I guess I find it hard to believe."</p>
<p>"Well, why don't you tell him that you're enjoying this and want it to continue. If we're right, maybe he'll... I dunno... be okay with it somehow."</p>
<p>"You mean... like an open marriage?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess. Like I said the other day, it works out for lots of couples. For all you know, he might want the same thing."</p>
<p>"It's not like I don't love Jeremy, I do, and I wouldn't want to jeopardize that. But I also love what we have at the same time, which is different. I guess you're right that this is what it's like for those people who... you know... aren't monogamous." She paused for a moment. "And if he doesn't like the idea? What if he gets mad?"</p>
<p>"I dunno, just pass it off as the hormones talking. Residual emotions from our sessions together, and that it will pass. Then we'll figure something out, I guess."</p>
<p>She giggled and said, "Okay..."</p>
<p>The mood suddenly lifted. We both suddenly felt like there was a chance this might continue in a way that worked for everyone. Deep down, some part of me feared that Jeremy would think the idea was ridiculous and forbid us from ever seeing one another again, but I blocked these thoughts from my mind with urgency, clutching to every last shred of hope that I could.</p>
<p>Kate continued, "Would it be okay if you were there when I asked? For support?"</p>
<p>"If you want. I can adjust my own reaction, depending on what he says."</p>
<p>Kate took a deep breath in, then paused. Finally she said, "Okay, let's do it." She squeezed my hand and we grinned at each other. "Are you excited?"</p>
<p>"For what, talking to Jeremy?"</p>
<p>"No, silly. I mean, for me to be pregnant! I'm going to be carrying our child!"</p>
<p>"Oh- yes!"</p>
<p>"I have actually thought we should continue to make love during pregnancy. I've read that it can change my hormonal state in a way that impacts the child in beneficial ways."</p>
<p>"Ha, that's good. Tell Jeremy that."</p>
<p>She laughed. "It's true!"</p>
<p>"I hope so!" We both chuckled.</p>
<p>"Can you imagine us making love together, when I'm several weeks along?" she asked wistfully.</p>
<p>I imagined us making love in her bed, spooning as I enter Kate from behind, my hand softly resting on her round belly, or cupping her swollen, milk-laden breasts as they rest heavy against my palms. I groaned. She laughed.</p>
<p>"I guess that's my answer!" she said cheerfully.</p>
<p>I did everything I could to keep this excitement alive until the end of our meeting. I didn't want to leave her again in a state of limbo.</p>
<p>That weekend we had planned to meet at Rodney's for dinner, supposedly as a celebration of sorts, to officially acknowledge the success of our efforts. Still, I was a bundle of nerves. Nothing much was at stake, just the fate of my relationship with the loveliest woman I'd ever met.</p>
<p>We ordered a bunch of food to share. Jeremy and I made our way through the craft beer selection, much to the dismay of Kate, who watched us with jealousy. All things considered, Jeremy wasn't a bad guy to hang out with. It just took him much longer to open up than most people. I still wasn't sure how he'd react when Kate dropped the news, however. At least the conversation thus far had put him in a relatively jovial mood.</p>
<p>I toasted to their pregnancy, and to the success of our sessions, wishing them well, but all the while wondering when Kate would finally drop the bomb. I worried that the more she let us drink, the more she risked a unwanted reaction from her husband, but I had to trust that she knew what she was doing.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the meal, Kate gave me a look and I knew what was coming. I nodded. She breathed in deeply.</p>
<p>"So hon, there's something that I've wanted to tell you that's weighing on my mind. I suppose it's good that Nick is here, so he can hear it too."</p>
<p>Jeremy perked up. "Let's hear it," he said.</p>
<p>"First of all, I want to say how much I've really appreciated your understanding and trust in letting me obtain the natural conception that I wanted to achieve. That was important to me, and I think it has worked out well, and we have Nick to thank for that."</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"That said... I have felt for the last couple days that the job isn't finished. I feel that there's still a role for him to play in this process. Though we're going to raise this child as our own, it's still biologically his. The man who fathers a child still has a role to play during development, be it additional emotional support, the continued growth of a bond between the two of us, how that impacts my hormonal state, and the signals that passes to a growing child in the womb. I started this process because I wanted everything about childbirth to be natural, but it is not natural for him to abruptly exit the process just like that."</p>
<p>Jeremy stared at her, blinking.</p>
<p>"This has nothing to do with you. You have done nothing wrong. You are a wonderful husband, and will be a wonderful father. But Nick and I need to see this through. We need more time together. We need further intimacy together. We need to complete this process the way a typical couple would, for psychological and emotional reasons. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>Kate didn't wait for his reply. She was getting increasingly emotional, as if anticipating his objection. Suddenly, she cut to the chase.</p>
<p>"And look- lots of people aren't cut out for one-hundred percent monogamous relationships. I'm not even looking to supplement our marriage with something you cannot provide. I am merely expecting to maintain, to some degree, an intimate bond with the person who gave us this wonderful gift of a child, who I let into my home, and my heart, with the understanding that he could provide us with something special. I guess what I've found is that it's not a simple transaction, like paying someone for a service. There's a real, human connection involved that doesn't just go away the moment the transaction is complete. It's different from what you and I have, but I don't see how it would be wrong to have both."</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>Jeremy looked like he was about to reply, but Kate cut him off as she became increasingly animated and passionate. I started to smirk, because I could not help myself.</p>
<p>"And furthermore! I understand your reluctance with certain things. As a man, and a husband, you want respect. You have feelings, and sensitivities, and I understand that. I will always honor that. But I think you should reevaluate some of the artificial boundaries that you've drawn."</p>
<p>Jeremy remained perfectly frozen, as Kate continued.</p>
<p>"No oral sex? What is that!? This is what normal people do when they're being intimate, when they're sharing themselves with each other. Why should this have been any different? I think that ought to change. I think you ought to see the beauty in that, and not see it as a violation of our marriage, because it is not!"</p>
<p>Kate was breathing quickly. It appeared that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders; that she'd been freed of a tremendous source of frustration. I was astounded with her eruption of emotion and defense of me, and what we shared. In that moment she revealed what I had begun to suspect; that she just wasn't the type to limit herself to one sexual partner. I wanted to laugh and cheer, but I kept my mouth shut.</p>
<p>Jeremy seemed taken aback and sat quietly in his chair, watching his wife finish her speech, not uttering a single word. I wondered: would be blow up at her? Would this be the end? Did she just dial it up a few notches too many?</p>
<p>It appeared Kate was done, or at least taking a while to gather her next set of thoughts. She stared at Jeremy expecting some kind of response now. He calmly looked back and forth at the two of us with no indication of what he was truly thinking or feeling from his surprised expression. The awkward moment lingered for what seemed like an eternity before he finally took a deep breath and sat back thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Jeremy took a big gulp of beer, before a smirk began to creep across his face. "One condition, no exceptions, and I'll accept everything you've said," he replied, placing his hands firmly on the table.</p>
<p>Kate looked at him with surprise. "What's that?" she said, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>He seemed to be trembling slightly, and leaned in close. "You respect my right to be there, and watch, or whatever, any time I want," he said, in a low voice.</p>
<p>Kate's eyes opened wide and she shot a look at me. Our mutual expressions of shock turned to confusion, and then to amusement. Kate and Jeremy had both laid it all out on the table. She loved fucking another man, and he loved watching her do it. Things were as they were, and there was no reason to hide from it any longer.</p>
<p>As his answer began to crystallize in our minds and our concerns over the future started to abruptly vanish, Kate and I continued to lock eyes, savoring that moment. The year ahead flashed through my mind; Kate's growing belly and plump, swelling breasts, our passionate fucking in the bedroom, on the couch, in the shower, wherever we wanted. The freedom to go down on pregnant Kate, and for her to freely suck my cock. Any position or style of pleasure we wanted was permitted now, so long as Jeremy was given an opportunity for access.</p>
<p>Jeremy and I took another swig of beer, both smirking. It looked as if Kate wasn't breathing. I feared she was about to turn blue. She finally gasped for air and clutched my hand.</p>
<p>Then, at the exact same time, all three of us burst into a round of happy laughter.</p>


<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>Nick grabbed his keys before he'd even finished chewing the last bite of breakfast. His phone lit up with another alert and he smiled.</p>
<p>"Geez, hang on, I'm on my way," he remarked. He loved when Kate's desire fueled such impatience. She'd even sent him the always-sexy peach emoji three times in a row. He replied with an eggplant and water droplets. By the time he got outside, he'd received a grinning face with star eyes. Nick loved how corny she could be at times. Somehow, it turned him on like nothing else did.</p>
<p>He merged onto the highway and cranked the volume on his car stereo, as he had become accustomed to doing on the way to Kate's. Nick's body surged with adrenaline and anticipation. Visiting her home for an early morning quickie had become an occasional delight whenever he had a service appointment scheduled for work on the same side of town.</p>
<p>As he pulled onto her street, he recognized Jeremy's car heading off in the opposite direction. They exchanged brief glances, which expressed nothing, but Nick breathed a sigh of relief. Nick didn't mind his occasional presence, as Jeremy had demanded, but it was always nice to have Kate all to himself.</p>
<p>Granted, it wasn't so bad when Jeremy was around. Since establishing their special arrangement, Kate's husband watched she and Nick enjoy each other every now and then. At first he sat in the corner, watching them together while pleasuring himself. After a while, he began to join in, taking turns with Nick as they both fucked his wife. Kate seemed delighted to have not one but two cocks at her disposal.</p>
<p>Initially Nick had wondered whether Kate needed him to satisfy her needs in ways Jeremy did not, but he came to discover that he seemed perfectly well equipped for the job. Nick found relief in the apparent fact that his relationship with Kate really did just start as a means to get pregnant by a surrogate, if only so that it would put his mind at ease about ongoing awkwardness with Jeremy.</p>
<p>Knowing that Nick was on his way, Kate always left the front door unlocked. He'd slip into the house to hear the sound of breakfast sizzling in the kitchen. Peeking inside, he'd find Kate at the stove in a fuzzy pink robe. He'd come up behind her, quietly, then untie it and slip his hands around her waist, over her growing belly. Months after Kate announced her pregnancy, she was really starting to show.</p>
<p>Kate closed her eyes and smiled, sighing softly, then slowly turned to offer Nick a deep kiss. She moved her hands down between his legs to feel how hard her pregnant body made him, and started to giggle.</p>
<p>After a rushed breakfast, Kate hurried upstairs, tugging Nick behind her. There she turned and let her robe slip from her body, revealing her swollen breasts, round tummy, and lacy pink panties. Nick quickly got undressed and followed her to the bed, grinning as he saw the excitement welling up inside his lover and the mischievous glint in her eye.</p>
<p>Kate laid back on the unmade bed, which still smelled of sleep, and the faint, feminine odor of her body which stubbornly lingered on the rumpled sheets. He gazed at her heavy breasts, laden with milk, and tipped with dark, sensitive nipples. They moved with such slow, dramatic motion the more enlarged they got. Nick craved the blissful moment when he buried his face in the deep crevice between her warm tits, and he stayed there for several moments, smiling.</p>
<p>When he came up for air, Kate was already grasping for his stiff cock. When she made contact she sighed with pleasure and gave him a playful squeeze. She loved the feeling of him surging from within her firm grip, aching for the pleasures of her body. Nick slid Kate's panties off, slowly, taking his time in adoring her beautiful pussy which was already showing signs of arousal.</p>
<p>"Oooh, look what you found," Kate said playfully, as he ran his fingers through her wet folds. He moved his hand up through the soft fuzz of her pubic hair, leaving a trail of moisture glistening all the way up to her belly button. Kate reached down and lifted his hand, moving it closer to his mouth and making him suck her juices off his fingers.</p>
<p>"I don't know why you bother to eat breakfast before you leave, when you can just come here and eat me," she giggled.</p>
<p>"That was breakfast, this is dessert," he said, grinning, before burying his face between her legs. His tongue navigated her glistening, satiny flesh as she moaned with pleasure, cupping her breasts and arching her back suddenly.</p>
<p>"Fuck, Nick..." she whimpered as he helped himself to her swollen womanhood until his face was a mess with her pleasure. "I can't stand it--" she moaned when he finally emerged. "Where's that cock of yours?" She grasped at it again, eying it hungrily. She gave it a few quick strokes, then growled, "I've been waiting to feel that magnificent thing inside me all morning!"</p>
<p>"Oh really..." he teased, "Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" she shouted. "Fuck me, already!"</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Goddammit Nick!" she laughed. "Get that big cock of yours inside me right now!"</p>
<p>They continued to laugh together as he sunk his hard, thick erection deep into her pink depths. Nick felt her body come alive as he entered. She moaned softly as he smoothly penetrated her, causing their bodies to ease together as closely as possible. Kate wrapped her arms around Nick, clutching his arched, muscular back. She gazed up into his eyes, drunk on the sensation of his massive member stretching and filling her completely from the inside, and softly throbbing with pleasure.</p>
<p>"Is this okay?" asked Nick, as he began to thrust slowly. He was increasingly aware of the difficulties Kate began to face as her pregnancy developed.</p>
<p>"Yes... I think so..." she replied, adjusting herself for comfort.</p>
<p>As Nick continued to slowly drive his cock in and out, he began to softly caress her rounded stomach, enjoying the smooth contour of her soft skin. Her large, weighty breasts undulated with a steady rhythm, as her pussy, spread wide for him, received his aching thrusts. Everything was more pronounced during her pregnancy; her pleasure, the swell of her excited body, her scent, the relentless emissions that squirted excitedly from her body.</p>
<p>They fucked passionately, hopelessly connected, addicted to each other's body like a drug. Then Kate pushed Nick back onto the bed, full of determination and lust, and ready to take charge. She lifted herself onto his body and forced his cock back inside her. Her messy hair, still cast astray by sleep, fell all over her face as she rolled her head back and softly parted her lips. She rode his cock forcefully, arching her back and putting the movement of her full breasts on display as her hips rose and fell.</p>
<p>Nick reached up and cupped her engorged tits, running his fingers over her deep, dark, sensitive nipples.</p>
<p>"Jesus, NIck!" Kate moaned, barely able to look him in the eyes. He could see how overwhelmed with pleasure she was as she frantically whipped her hips against his. He urged his hips against hers in a fit of passion, driven wild by the sensation of his tingling cock gliding through her warm canal.</p>
<p>Finally their eyes met, widened and glistening with emotion, coming to the mutual realization that they were both about to experience the peak of pleasure together. Kate cried out as she began to spasm and squirt. Her head fell forward and she clutched his chest as the waves of pleasure took hold. Nick felt himself struck by the same pleasures; unloading with urgency inside her warm body. Kate could feel him flooding her with spurt after spurt of cum as he gazed helplessly into her eyes.</p>
<p>They collapsed against one another, exhausted and listening to the rhythm of each other's strained breaths. Kate leaned into Nick's body, nuzzling him softly, as if having found the safest place in the world. They lay in bed together, lost in a pleasant daydream, until Nick finally snapped out of it and turned to face her.</p>
<p>"Is it getting harder for you? Now that you've grown so big, I mean," he asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Can you tell?" she said, self-consciously.</p>
<p>"A little. But I would assume that's normal. We just need to adjust and do what's easiest for you, I guess."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Kate sighed again, seemingly disappointed at the difficulties of lovemaking that were beginning to come to light as her pregnancy advanced. "I've been thinking about that. You know, trying some different techniques now that I'm getting so big."</p>
<p>"Sure, no big deal," Nick said, smiling reassuringly.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of pondering this, Kate added, "Maybe we should ask Allison. She helped us get pregnant, after all."</p>
<p>"Oh... Yeah. I would think she has some tips," said Nick.</p>
<p>However, he was conflicted. Having Allison watch Nick and Kate making love, in her role as Kate's fertility coach, was something he thought about-- a lot. The more he thought about it, the more he became confused about his relationship with Allison.</p>
<p>Lately, things had become even more confused. After spending the morning engaged in a wild, passionate fuck with Kate, a happily married woman, Nick often ended his day meeting Allison for a beer where they caught a football game together and shared everything about their lives. Sometimes this time spilled into the weekend, where they'd find excuses to do casual activities together.</p>
<p>Deep down, he knew something was weighing on Allison's mind just as much as it was with him, but neither of them appeared to have any intent to confront it.</p>
<p>Jeremy pulled up in front of a large, Victorian house on the west side. Being the wealthy part of town, he often took jobs in the area, where the clientele had large yards and even larger ideas of how they should be landscaped. After he took a quick glance around the property himself, he instructed his men to continue the routine assessment while he met with the client.</p>
<p>Making his way up the path to the front door, Jeremy could smell the money. He hoped it was the typical rich old lady who would come to treat him like a son and shower praise on him for the mundane tasks he and his team performed, subsequently paying him handsomely for it. He rang the doorbell and waited. After several moments the door opened and a young woman appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>Jeremy was taken aback, given how much she differed from what he was expecting. She had medium-length black hair cut into a gentle bob, piercing eyes, and a sassy smile. The girl wore an oversized designer plaid shirt and black tights. He pegged her as one of the new young professionals that were starting to buy real estate in the area and slowly change the demographics. Maybe she was in real estate herself, or else she worked downtown at one of the new financial firms that were moving in.</p>
<p>"Hello?" she said impatiently, with a smirk. She looked Jeremy up and down, curiously.</p>
<p>"Oh, hi, I'm Jeremy. I'm the landscap--"</p>
<p>"Oh! Yes, hi. Thanks for coming," the girl said, suddenly looking past him and discovering the trucks. "I'm Claire." She held her hand out. They shook. "Do you want to come in?"</p>
<p>"Sure," he said, following her inside.</p>
<p>"Just take your shoes off. New floors," she said, smiling.</p>
<p>Jeremy removed his shoes, and had to admit that the renovation inside the house was quite impressive. "Who did your reno? It's very nice," he said.</p>
<p>"Me," she said, confidently crossing her arms. "Isn't it?" She looked around, pleased, then smiled back at Jeremy. She pegged him as a simple guy from the other side of town. Tall, strong, handsome, probably not a rocket scientist, but more than made up for it in bed. Claire noticed he didn't wear a wedding ring; part of a routine assessment that she gave any man that she met.</p>
<p>She gave Jeremy a quick tour and then offered him some coffee in the kitchen where they sat down and began to discuss her ideas, which he quickly realized were going to be a real, worthwhile challenge, and an interesting job to take on. He found Claire to be sharper and more knowledgeable than he would have guessed, and she found him to be exactly the kind of insightful, experienced landscape contractor that she was looking for.</p>
<p>When they had finished laying out the groundwork for the job, Claire excused herself to get a glass of water. Jeremy watched her stroll across the kitchen with such a cool, sophisticated air about her; both laid back and authoritative at the same time. She bent over the sink to stick a glass under the water filter attached to the running faucet. He found himself gazing down at her perfectly round ass and the long, smooth line of the curve separating her cheeks. There was no doubt about it: he found her incredibly fascinating and attractive.</p>
<p>Claire shot a look back at Jeremy. For a few brief moments, she realized he didn't know she was watching him. She followed his eyes and knew where he was looking. She wanted to laugh but didn't want to startle him. She felt herself blushing. Was she really blushing at this hunky, lumberjack of a guy, checking out her ass? Claire's mind immediately went to a dirty place, full of steamy love affairs and secret outdoor trysts that risked discovery by the other workers.</p>
<p>Jeremy looked up and caught Claire watching him. He quickly looked away, embarrassed. Claire finally let out a chuckle and finished her water.</p>
<p>"So... I guess we're done here," she said, returning to the kitchen table with a smile.</p>
<p>"Yup," said Jeremy, suddenly feeling anxious.</p>
<p>"Great! I look forward to what we're going to do together," she said, realizing that sounded a lot like something else, given where her mind was just at.</p>
<p>"Me too," he said, smiling. "I'll... um... convey your ideas to my team and we'll get started."</p>
<p>"Sounds good," she said, finding the conversation suddenly awkward. She decided to try to make a joke. "It's always fun to pay a man to trim my bushes." Claire turned red. "Did I really just say that?" she asked herself. She was laughing inside.</p>
<p>Jeremy turned red also and laughed awkwardly. "Okay, I'll get moving," he said, getting up.</p>
<p>Claire escorted Jeremy to the door and watched him get his shoes back on, then head outside and down the path. "Yup, excellent ass," she mused, watching him go.</p>
<p>Jeremy instinctively glanced over his shoulder and spotted Claire checking him out. He found himself getting an unexpected thrill. She looked up at him, as if she didn't care that he noticed she was ogling him back. Claire gave him a smirk, then swung around and shut the door behind her.</p>
<p>As he made his way back to his team, he began to enjoy the sudden high he was feeling. This was one of those jobs, he thought, that he would look forward to every day.</p>
<p>That weekend, Nick joined Allison downtown on a shopping trip. "I need a new pair of jeans," she had simply said. That was all Nick needed to hear to offer to tag along and offer his opinion. He didn't need much of an excuse to spend time with her, nor she with him. Together they danced around the idea of getting together, never really daring to confront it directly.</p>
<p>"Okay, you can sit here and I'll come out and model them for you," Allison said, heading toward the fitting room with her selections.</p>
<p>"Oh, I can't come in?" Nick joked.</p>
<p>"Ha, you wish!" Allison snickered, offering him a wink as she vanished through the doorway. The door swung shut and Nick heard the lock click. His eyes traveled down to the gap between the floor and the door. Shadows moved back and forth. Then they stopped. He heard the faint sound of fabric sliding off. He knew Allison was standing inside in her underwear. He longed for a quick peek even. Anything to satisfy his growing desire for her.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the lock clicked again and the door swung open. Allison stood there leaning against the door frame, sarcastically running her hand along the long line of her left leg, and teasing Nick with a sexy stance.</p>
<p>"How do I look?"</p>
<p>Nick gazed at her body and the tight denim that clung to her sexy curves. "Wh-- huh?" he mumbled, having not fully processed what she asked.</p>
<p>Allison laughed. "Okay, that's a sign of approval if I ever heard one!" She turned around and bent her knees slightly. "How does my ass look?" She glanced back at Nick with a smirk.</p>
<p>"Hmm. Give me a few minutes to do a proper analysis. Can you maybe move it about, a little bit?" Nick replied with equal sarcasm. He leaned back in his seat and put his hands behind his head, making a show of enjoying the view.</p>
<p>Allison laughed again and briefly twerked for Nick, then snickered and escaped inside the fitting room again.</p>
<p>After making her purchase, Nick and Allison made their way to a cafe for some sandwiches, finding a private nook in the corner by a window. Following some playful banter throughout lunch, Allison grabbed her mug, sunk into a pile of colorful pillows, and gave a relaxed sigh.</p>
<p>"Oh, so-- guess who I heard from," she said.</p>
<p>"Who?" replied Nick.</p>
<p>"Kate," she responded with a laugh. "Now she wants some tips on lovemaking while pregnant. I'm supposed to go there next week and... um... offer some guidance like I did last time." She smirked at Nick.</p>
<p>Suddenly overcome with surprise, and without thinking, Nick let slip, "Oh, so... you're okay with that? I figured you'd find out sooner or later, but..."</p>
<p>"Yeah I'm okay with it, after what I witnessed the first time, nothing else is gonna faze me..."</p>
<p>Nick couldn't decide if he should feel relieved, or hurt that Allison wasn't jealous. He replied, "Oh okay, i wasn't sure, you know, how you're react, finding out about me and her."</p>
<p>Allison froze, then said, "Huh?"</p>
<p>Nick looked at her confused. "About how we're still making love. I wasn't sure how you'd react."</p>
<p>"Y-you're still... Sorry, what?" Allison said, barely able to speak.</p>
<p>"You mean, she didn't-- shit," Nick said, finally realizing that Allison wasn't aware that her guidance was as much for Kate and he, as it was for her and Jeremy.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" said Allison, clutching her mug so hard that Nick thought it might break.</p>
<p>"Um... well... she's asking for those tips for her and me too, not just Jeremy," he said with a gulp.</p>
<p>"You're... still fucking her?"</p>
<p>"Well she thought-- she and Jeremy thought that it would be a good idea that we continue making love through her pregnancy because... um... she expressed a need for the emotional bond to continue, and--"</p>
<p>Allison interrupted by rolling her eyes. "And of course you went right along with it." She gave a defensive laugh.</p>
<p>"Well-- I--"</p>
<p>"No, it's okay, I get it. I don't blame you. She's a pretty girl, obviously." She paused for a moment. "Do you love her? She's married..."</p>
<p>"Oh! No, it's nothing like that. I know she's married. It's... complicated."</p>
<p>"I'll say!"</p>
<p>"I just haven't been so lucky with women for a while. And the opportunity presented itself to have certain needs met in the meantime, and it just kinda happened."</p>
<p>"Well, maybe your lack of luck is really just you being so preoccupied with Kate that you're not fully considering your other options," Allison said, setting her coffee mug down on the table.</p>
<p>They spent the rest of the afternoon suffering an awkward tension that Nick knew he'd caused, and didn't know how to fix. Still, Nick got the answer he wanted: Allison was clearly jealous. Allison clearly wanted him. He wanted her too, and this news didn't change anything. Rather, it only seemed to make them more desperate for each other.</p>
<p>A few days into the landscaping job, Jeremy found himself excited to start each morning waltzing up to the large Victorian home where Claire waited for him. They'd find some excuse to elaborate on updates about the progress of the job, just so they could spend a little more time flirting. It quickly became apparent to both of them that there was some strong sexual chemistry brewing, which only fueled their suggestive banter and edged Claire closer and closer to making a real move.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>One thing kept burning in Jeremy's mind: did Kate really mean all the things she said about a more open marriage? More specifically, was it an invitation to him to find his own partner on the side, or did his wife's special relationship with Nick uniquely have to do with her pregnancy?</p>
<p>Jeremy decided that he wouldn't dare tell Kate about Claire if anything happened, just in case. That wouldn't be hard. Kate didn't know anything about any of Jeremy's customers. She just wasn't interested in his landscaping business the way Claire seemed to be.</p>
<p>Moreover, he found himself thinking more and more about being the blue-collar guy in a fantasy about fucking the woman who hired him. He seriously considered the possibility, then waffled, unsure about the situation with Kate. But Claire was mesmerizing; thin, petite, with perky breasts. She was upbeat and energetic. She seemed genuinely interested in him.</p>
<p>Claire explored the same possibilities in her imagination. What if she seduced the landscape contractor? He was good-looking, strong, masculine. He seemed a little naive, maybe easily dominated. She could do with him what she pleased and then let him go. She couldn't stop admiring his body, so Claire began wearing sexier things, spending time each morning before he arrived selecting what she thought might entice him. She knew he liked her in tights already. Picking the right top would make him uncomfortable in all the best ways.</p>
<p>The front door swung open and Claire greeted Jeremy like she did every day: showing off her body in subtle ways and giving him a sly look before welcoming him in.</p>
<p>"Well, the pachysandra is going down," Jeremy started. "Oh, and we noticed some leaf spots on the maple we'll need to look at. I'm not sure if you've--"</p>
<p>Claire cut him off. "First things first. I need coffee. You?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that'd be great," he replied, as they made their way to the kitchen. Jeremy watched her wag her ass all the way to the coffee machine. He couldn't help but believe she was doing it on purpose. He wanted to scream, it was so perfect. Just sixty seconds after the door opened, he was already throbbing in his pants.</p>
<p>Claire couldn't stand it any more. She felt as if she was going to lose her mind, and laughed to herself at the thought of just walking over and tearing his clothes off. As she slid some mugs up to the coffee machine and prepared to fill them up, she felt herself getting wet already. The mere sight of Jeremy was enough to trigger all sorts of flashes of what naughty things she imagined them doing together in secret. She imagined him coming up behind her while she poured coffee, spinning her around and giving her the look, before they...</p>
<p>"Can I help with anything?" said Jeremy.</p>
<p>"Oh, sure, come here," replied Claire, as her heart started beating. She felt Jeremy come up behind her, but he stopped short before getting too close. She backed away from the counter slightly, until she felt his body begin to rest against hers. Jeremy began to panic as she moved her buttocks backward until it was up against his crotch. He was hard, and he feared she would know it.</p>
<p>Claire thought she felt something, but had to be sure. She pressed firmly against his body as she lifted the mugs. She felt what seemed to be his manhood pressing back against her ass, she innocently rubbed it against him as she turned, presenting two, hot coffees with a grin. Yes, indeed, she had felt his erection.</p>
<p>"So... um... " she said, unable to stop herself from smirking. "Do you want some sugar?"</p>
<p>Jeremy blinked at her.</p>
<p>Claire leaned closer.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the dam burst. Claire swung the mugs back onto the counter where they splashed everywhere. She lunged at Jeremy, and the two pressed their lips together. They found themselves swept up in an outpouring of passion and frantic, hungry kisses, as their minds raced with excitement at the realization of what was happening. After several moments they pulled away from each other and shared the same look; as if to say, "Did that really just happen?"</p>
<p>Finally, Claire laughed and said, "Fuck it. Let's do this." She grabbed his shirt and had it over his head in no time, then gawked at his bare, muscular chest. Jeremy frantically searched for all the buttons on Claire's shirt until he was able to help her out of it, revealing the outline of her breasts tightly packed inside a lacy red bra.</p>
<p>They continued to search madly for each other's mouth, while grabbing frantically at each other's clothing, desperate to undress each other. Claire managed to get Jeremy's belt undone and dropped his pants. Jeremy unsnapped Claire's bra, and felt a sudden thrill as he watched her gorgeous, perky tits spring out. Claire caught his reaction and smirked, then tugged him forward by the waistband of his boxer briefs.</p>
<p>"Let's see what you've got down here for me," she said, grinning.</p>
<p>Claire squatted down in front of Jeremy and slowly began to drag his underwear down, inch by inch, as he stared at her in disbelief. Moments later Jeremy's half-erect cock popped free and bounced in front of Claire's face. She studied it briefly with a look of fascination. Jeremy could feel himself throbbing harder as he saw the delight in her eyes. It slowly began to rise even further into the air, until his massive, swollen shaft stuck virtually straight up in the air.</p>
<p>Claire reached forward and began to caress Jeremy's stiffened cock, occasionally glancing up at him as if to express how impressed she was with his length and girth. She found herself salivating, and without warning, plunged his cock into her mouth. Jeremy groaned as he felt the sensation of Claire's soft mouth hungrily sucking on his manhood. Claire felt Jeremy pulsing against her tongue as she tasted him.</p>
<p>After a few moments, she sweetly kissed his penis, and then ran her tongue sensually up and down the full length of his shaft. Claire was instantly enthralled by his cock; its arousing, musky scent, its steely hardness, and its perfect, erotic shape.</p>
<p>Seeing her becoming so aroused was too much for Jeremy. He lifted Claire back up until she stood before him, bearing her chest seductively. He dove in, hungrily suckling at her petite breasts and exploring the hard nubs of her pink nipples with his tongue. Claire shivered with pleasure as he helped himself to her body. She could feel the stain forming on her black tights as she began to tingle wildly between her legs.</p>
<p>As if on cue, Jeremy frantically moved his hands down her body to explore her womanhood. He slipped his hand into her tights and felt his fingers make sudden contact with her silky, naturally lubricated flesh. She moaned loudly as he ran his fingers over her labia and plunged them through her delicate folds.</p>
<p>"Oh shit, Jeremy..." she said, suddenly overtaken with the surprise pleasure.</p>
<p>Jeremy pulled his hand out of her tights. His fingers were glistening. He could smell the enchanting scent of her wet pussy as he lifted it into the air. He couldn't take it anymore. Jeremy spun Claire around. She laughed and bent over onto the kitchen counter. He found himself staring at Claire's perfect, round ass, packed tightly into the thin, stretchy fabric of her black tights.</p>
<p>Jeremy slid his hands back into her clothes, and slid the tights down over her butt. Claire's two soft cheeks bloomed forth in front of his eyes with a slight wobble. He slid her clothing down completely, until she kicked them off, and then gazed upon her magnificent ass.</p>
<p>Claire quickly straddled her legs to either side, quivering with anticipation. His cock jumped excitedly at the sight of her pussy spreading open at the base of her ass; pink and velvety, glistening with moisture, with a soft wisp of dark pubic hair peeking out. Jeremy gripped her ass excitedly and began to ease his hips forward. He moaned as he felt his thick cock sink deeply into Claire's pussy until she had devoured him fully.</p>
<p>"Ohhh, fuck! Yes!" Claire hollered, as she instinctively pressed her hips back against his slow thrust. Jeremy lost himself briefly to a fierce lust as he began to drive his cock through her creamy slit, finding its home deep inside her. The repeat pounding of his body against hers caused the loose flesh of her buttocks to ripple and wobble in a way that only fueled Jeremy's burning desire.</p>
<p>Then he had a moment of clarity. He suddenly came to terms with the fact that he had his swollen cock inside another woman's pussy. Someone other than his wife. A beautiful, young customer who wanted his body as much as he wanted hers. As they fucked with the excitement of a first-time encounter, neither could believe that this was actually happening to them; that they could be so lucky.</p>
<p>They moved to the kitchen table. Claire ran her arm across the table top and cleared aside the papers that she'd left there. She hopped onto the hard, wooden surface and threw her legs apart. Jeremy caught his first full view of Claire's pink pussy as she spread it wide for him as if to beg for his cock once again. It bobbed in front of his body as he repositioned himself and then plunged it back inside her. She grabbed his sturdy arms to steady herself and bucked her hips against his, grinding her teeth with determination to be driven to the absolute summits of pleasure.</p>
<p>"Yes! Fuuuck meee!" she groaned, as her hair swung repeatedly over her widening eyes. She started straight at her partner's body; strong, powerful, muscular and veiny, brimming with sexual desire for her body, and sporting a massive erection that plunged repeatedly into her satiny depths.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, I'm gonna coooome!" she shrieked as her body exploded with pleasure. Jeremy fucked her with abandon, watching her eyes roll back into her head, and her breasts lurch excitedly with every thrust of his cock. Claire felt herself squirting repeatedly, drenching Jeremy's cock with her feminine juices over and over until they began to drip onto the tabletop.</p>
<p>"Ngh!" Jeremy groaned, suddenly pulling his cock out of Claire. He quickly began stroking it. She sprung into action, sitting upright and positioning herself before the head of his penis. She dropped her jaw and opened wide. Nothing made her feel more daring, more dirty, more devious than causing a guy to come all over her body.</p>
<p>Their eyes met as Jeremy felt the sudden surge of pleasure coursing through his body. Thick spurts of cum began to usher forth, splashing across Claire's mouth and tongue as she suppressed laughter and tried to keep up with his powerful emissions. Spasm after spasm continued to take charge of his body, as he watched his new, young lover accept his cum with hunger and zeal, until her lips were shiny and her chin was dripping.</p>
<p>"Wow..." she said, struggling with words. Jeremy stumbled backward, trying to regain his senses. She reached forward and lovingly massaged Jeremy's balls. "Poor things are gonna be sore tomorrow!" she giggled. He laughed.</p>
<p>Then, wordlessly, they stared at each other with the sudden enthusiasm of two insatiable lovers, slowly coming to terms with the wild future that now lay before them.</p>
<p>The following week, Nick found himself feeling anxious about visiting Kate for some hanky panky for the first time since their initial encounter so long ago. That morning he found himself feeling mildly nauseous, sweating a little, and having a rapid heart rate. This was, of course, not because of Kate herself. -- It was because Allison was joining them, just like she had during their first meeting.</p>
<p>The anxious thoughts started swarming in his head. Allison would sit everyone down, calmly begin to describe the various methods of lovemaking they should use, in explicit detail. Moreover, she would follow them to the bedroom, watch them undress and lead each other to a state of arousal, then guide them through the various intimate sexual acts that couples normally do not put on display for others.</p>
<p>All it once it was daunting, exciting, awkward, and arousing. Nick couldn't decide if he was looking forward to reliving that experience, or if he was afraid it would ruin everything that had been progressing with Allison. Would she be turned on at the sight of his nude body again? Or would it just stir up the hornet's nest of her jealousy again? What was she thinking? Was this a mistake? He couldn't make sense of it all.</p>
<p>The whole ride there, music failed to set fire to Nick's imagination as it usually did. All fantasies were dulled. His mind remained fixed on the worries he had about Allison, until finally he pulled up to Kate's house and found her exiting her car. She took one look at him, and he knew she was just as anxious as he was.</p>
<p>They made their way to the front door together, neither one ready to speak, until finally Allison opened her mouth.</p>
<p>"So, uh... are you... ready to do this again?"</p>
<p>"I think so..."</p>
<p>"You must be used to it now," she said, laughing nervously. "But it's still awkward for me."</p>
<p>Nick realized this was his chance to say something, or else risk letting Allison's anxiety obscure her understanding of how he really felt.</p>
<p>"Listen... Allison. I'm feeling a little awkward too. I can't deny that I've enjoyed what Kate and I have been doing. But... lately I've realized where my true feelings really lie." He thought he sounded stupid, fumbling over his words. However, Allison seemed to stopped breathing and looked up at him with wide eyes.</p>
<p>They found themselves standing in front of the door.</p>
<p>"I don't want any of this to come between us. The truth is, I've really enjoyed all the time we've spent together lately. I just don't want any of this to mess that up. So, if--"</p>
<p>Allison's jaw quivered as she gazed up at him with a tender expression. He knew that she wanted to say something, but was still processing what he had just said. She finally began to open her mouth to interject something, when the door swung open and Kate appeared.</p>
<p>"You guys! I'm so excited, get in here!" she squealed, oblivious to the critical moment Nick and Allison were in the midst of. They both looked at Kate, who stared back at them expectantly before moving aside to let them by.</p>
<p>Allison walked inside and Nick followed, cursing the fact that he'd not heard what she was about to say.</p>
<p>"This is gonna be so much fun! Allison, everything you helped us with last time was so, so great. We can't thank you enough!" exclaimed Kate.</p>
<p>"Oh, no problem," said Allison, sheepishly. She seemed lost in thought.</p>
<p>"And you-- get over here, mister," said Kate, tugging Nick forward by the waist of his pants. She planted a big kiss on his mouth and smirked at him.</p>
<p>The three of them made their way to the living room where Kate and Nick sat on the couch and waited for Allison to finish setting up her laptop for a presentation. When she finished, she turned to face her small audience. Allison made brief eye contact with Nick, and they acknowledged each other's nervousness for a moment, before she shook it off and got herself into a professional mode.</p>
<p>Allison hit a key on her keyboard and the screen switched to the first slide. It was an illustration of a young couple seated at the edge of their bed. The woman was visibly pregnant. They reached out to embrace each other, and appeared to be thoroughly excited about the special moment they were about to share together. It reminded Nick of the illustrations in sex education books designed to teach children, and made him chuckle.</p>
<p>"Well, that's a lot better than what you brought last time," laughed Kate.</p>
<p>Allison rolled her eyes. "Yes, no more pathetic line drawings. These came all the way from Sweden!" They all laughed, and the tension eased a bit.</p>
<p>"So," she began, "the first thing I have to say is that sexual intercourse during pregnancy is absolutely safe, and in some ways can be even more exciting and special than it normally is."</p>
<p>Kate smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Allison continued, "Today I will make you aware of what changes Kate's body is going through, and how that impacts intimacy. We'll also cover the sexual positions that you should avoid or that you should try, as they relate to a particular trimester, or to pregnancy in general."</p>
<p>She pressed a key on her laptop and the screen switched to the next slide. The same illustrated couple were now undressed from the waist up. The woman's breasts were rendered with an exaggerated shape and size. Her husband pointed at them with an expression of surprise.</p>
<p>Allison added, "Kate's breasts will continue to swell and will experience heightened sensitivity of the nipples. There may be some tenderness. Nick should take care when fondling them, but you can both take advantage of Kate's sensitivity for a more pleasurable, sensual experience during lovemaking."</p>
<p>Nick felt himself starting to become erect, listening to Allison talking about Kate's body.</p>
<p>The slide advanced. The couple was still sitting side-by-side on the bed, however, this time all their clothing was removed. The man's penis was standing up vertically in his lap. They both looked at it in astonishment. The woman held her hand over her mouth. Kate giggled, as if completing the illustrated woman's reaction.</p>
<p>Smirking, Allison resumed her narration. "So your options for foreplay remain largely unchanged. You are welcome to enjoy touching and enjoying each other's body just as you would normally, to stimulate arousal. Kate can still perform oral sex on Nick, for example."</p>
<p>The slide advanced again. This time, the blushing woman had her legs parted slightly, permitting her husband to view her vagina, which was depicted as swollen and parted slightly.</p>
<p>"However, Nick, the important thing to remember is that when you perform oral sex on Kate, you must be very careful not to allow any air to be trapped inside her vagina. Air bubbles can cause potentially serious complications."</p>
<p>Nick nodded.</p>
<p>"Aside from that, you may notice that Kate's genitals will be noticeably more engorged. So that's what we're seeing in this slide. That's absolutely normal, and happens to most women's vaginas during pregnancy. -- It can be a good thing! Increased blood flow to this area can mean more pleasure. Kate is already prone to becoming very wet, and this will only add to that. More lubrication is generally a good thing."</p>
<p>Kate turned and smiled at Nick, who smiled back at her. Allison watched them sharing this excitement and quieted down for a moment.</p>
<p>"Okay," she said, finally resuming, "Positions."</p>
<p>Allison flipped to the next slide. The couple was now lying in bed together. They were in a spooning position, both facing the same direction, with the man behind the woman. He reached around and cupped her breasts. She turned and glanced back at him with a large smile. His erect penis pointed straight forward, and appeared to enter his wife's vagina from behind.</p>
<p>"This is a good one. It's very sensual, and easy on the woman," Allison said, before explaining how it was performed.</p>
<p>The next slide appeared. It depicted the woman on her hands and knees. The man grabbed his wife's buttocks and thrust his penis inside her from behind. Both members of the loving couple had been given excited expressions and appeared to be blissfully happy sharing this intimacy. Nick was now fully throbbing in his pants, imagining Kate and he in the midst of this act, after the presentation was complete.</p>
<p>"Rear-entry is a great option, at least until the third trimester," Allison continued to explain, as she continued to flip through the slides, describing them in detail.</p>
<p>One slide depicted the couple reverse spooning; laying side-by-side, facing each other, at a slight angle. "Nick," Allison comically explained, "You'll be eye level with Kate's breasts, which I'm sure you'll enjoy, and you'll be able to thrust against each other without Kate's big belly getting in the way."</p>
<p>Allison showed a few other slides, including one of the couple sitting in a chair, with the woman straddling the man, as they gazed lovingly into each other's eyes.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"Avoid positions that would have Kate lying on the back, this complicates blood flow to the placenta," Allison noted. "Woman-on-top positions are generally a great option throughout pregnancy, as it avoids a lot of potential issues with other positions such as missionary, which you should avoid altogether."</p>
<p>The final slide was of the man lying flat as the woman squatted down onto his stiff erection. Her breasts appeared to be bouncing up and down, further illustrating the fact that she was happily riding his cock. The couple appeared to be laughing with joy and excitement, as the sensation of their erotic union sent them into a state of mutual ecstasy. The drawings were so simple, and yet so clear in their depiction of the emotion of this couple as they celebrated their love for one another, and their unfettered enjoyment of each other's body.</p>
<p>"And there you have it," said Allison, concluding her presentation. "Now for the... err... fun part; you'll get to try each of these positions, and discuss how they feel, then decide what works best for the both of you."</p>
<p>Kate got up excitedly, eager to begin the session, holding her hand upon her growing tummy, and unaware of any tension between Nick and Allison. They, on the other hand, exchanged brief looks, full of nervous hesitation.</p>
<p>"Let us retire to the boudoir," she said, sarcastically waving them toward the stairs. Allison and Nick's gaze remained fixed to each other as they began to follow Kate.</p>
<p>"I've really enjoyed it too," Allison whispered to Nick, responding to his earlier confession outside. He smiled at her with a sense of relief. She grasped his hand, and led him reassuringly up the stairway behind Kate, toward the bedroom. He could feel her palm, warm and trembling, straining tightly against his.</p>
<p>It felt different this time. Nick recalled how bewildered Allison was last time, and seemingly unaffected by the situation. It had been as if she didn't really come to terms with what she was about to see, until they were in the thick of it. Now, their feelings for each other had grown so much, that it was like the first time all over again, only more profound.</p>
<p>Allison felt dizzy and confused. She wanted so badly to see Nick's body again, but she so badly wanted to be the one to touch it, and to feel his loving embrace; his body against hers, in an intimate way that they'd never experienced together. She felt it was somehow her duty to help Kate, but at the same time, she felt as if she was betraying herself in the process. She tried to make sense of her place in Nick's world, if he already had Kate. She was starting to understand that she meant more to him, but she still questioned it with an anxious uncertainty every chance she got.</p>
<p>Kate led them into the familiar surroundings of her bedroom, stopped at the edge of the bed, and turned to reveal a wide grin.</p>
<p>"Now. Let's have some hot, kinky sex that won't leave me gasping and struggling so much," she laughed, holding her belly.</p>
<p>Nick smiled affectionately at her, as moved as he always was with Kate's unending enthusiasm for their special relationship. At the same time, he wavered back and forth between these glowing feelings and his concern about Allison. The intense guilt he felt about putting her in this position, knowing how far they'd come as friends, held him back.</p>
<p>Not waiting for Nick, Kate began to undress, pulling off her pants and tossing them on the end of the bed, and then removing her top and bra. Her enlarged breasts bounced free and settled softly into place in front of her chest. She cupped them and turned proudly toward Allison.</p>
<p>"Look how swollen they're getting!" she laughed. Allison smiled and nodded, staring at Kate's wide nipples, dramatically darkened through pregnancy. "I think Nick wishes they were always like this..." she added with a teasing smirk.</p>
<p>"They were already beautiful to begin with," Nick chuckled as he began to remove his clothes.</p>
<p>Grinning ear-to-ear, Kate slid her panties off and stood back up, sinking her hips to one side. Despite the girl time Allison had with Kate, since their first meeting, she still felt awkward seeing her new friend's naked body; with her fleshy butt cheeks jiggling as she shifted her weight from side to side. She noticed that Kate's pubic hair had grown a little thicker since last time, becoming a full, dark bush. Her grooming habits were not surprisingly getting less attention as her pregnancy advanced. Above all, the sight of her massive, swollen boobs and deep, dark nipples illustrated the undeniable reality of her fertile development.</p>
<p>Kate began her favorite sexy walk in Nick's direction as he began to reach for the zipper of his pants, saying playfully, "Already beautiful? Oh, so you don't appreciate how nice and big my boobs are getting? Hmm... that's too bad... they needed some attention from someone who appreciates them."</p>
<p>Nick laughed and managed to get his pants down. "No, no, I love them! They can get bigger!" he chuckled. Kate giggled and threw her arms around him, squeezing Nick tight and pressing her nipples firmly against his bare chest. Her breasts bulged dramatically to either side as they compressed against his skin.</p>
<p>She let him go, pointed to his underwear, and said, "Now get those things off!"</p>
<p>Allison watched with a passionately beating heart as Nick reached down and began to slide off his underwear. She loved everything about his body. His sexy chest, his flat, toned stomach. The sexy dimple of a bellybutton. She loved the little trail of almost imperceptible hair that ran from the base of it down to his crotch. She felt herself growing weak as the last piece of clothing on his body made its way over his cock, revealing the most intimate part of his body, which she savored the sight of with every fiber of her being.</p>
<p>Nick tossed the last of his clothes onto the small pile at the end of the bed and stood before Kate, breathing quickly, and dangling long and flaccid between his legs.</p>
<p>"Oh no, my favorite big guy isn't yet happy to see me!" she squealed, reaching down to caress his balls.</p>
<p>Allison cleared her throat and interjected, realizing that she'd forgotten to get into her instructor mindset. "Yes-- so-- um, feel free to engage in foreplay so that he's fully erect before we -- err, you -- proceed with these positions."</p>
<p>"With pleasure," Kate said, grinning. She squatted down and began to massage his shaft, watching it slowly fill with blood and enlarge before her eyes. Before long, it began to harden and rise high into the air. Kate looked at it proudly, then turned to her new BFF and said, "Doesn't he have the most beautiful penis? I want to just cover it in kisses!"</p>
<p>Allison smiled with amusement, despite a tingle of jealousy, as Kate leaned in and planted soft kisses all over Nick's skyward shaft. Then she opened her mouth and ran her tongue from the base to the tip.</p>
<p>"Mmmm," she said, glancing up at Nick who smiled down at her. She dove in, taking his cock in her mouth and sucking it slowly, with forceful, rhythmic motions that Allison could plainly see him enjoying. "God, I love your cock," she moaned, taking a brief break to admire it, before swallowing it whole again.</p>
<p>Allison could feel herself tingling between her legs, even growing a little wet, at the sight of Nick's long, hard cock gliding in and out of Kate's mouth as she gently caressed his balls. She shifted uncomfortably, but her thighs rubbing against one another only made it worse. She wanted to scream. No, she wanted to run over there and stuff his cock into her own mouth, to feel him throbbing on her tongue, to know his intimate scent and taste.</p>
<p>Nick's cock popped out of Kate's mouth, reddish and glistening with saliva. She stood up and let him admire the sight of her breasts as he ran his hands over them, enamored by their heavy weight and movement. Allison shook off her emotions as she watched the two lovers make their way slowly to the bed. Kate propped up the pillows and laid back, opening her hips slightly and placing her moistened, hairy pussy on display without any shame or embarrassment at Allison's presence.</p>
<p>Nick's cock twitched and surged with excitement as he made his way onto the bed, placing himself between her open legs, and admiring her long, nude body as if she were a goddess in repose.</p>
<p>Kate glanced over at Allison, who was still frozen in the same standing position along side the bed that she had been since they arrived. "Oh, you don't have to stand there the whole time, Allison. Come join us, I don't mind if you sit here on the bed next to us."</p>
<p>"Oh, o-kay," replied Allison, embarrassed to hear her voice cracking. She slipped quietly onto the bed, passing briefly beside their two naked bodies, before seating herself next to them. She was closer to Nick's erect penis than she had ever been. There it was, standing triumphantly in the air just inches in front of her, swollen and thick with passion.</p>
<p>She swallowed deeply, regained her composure, and then continued her instruction. "If you'd like to pleasure Kate now, just remember to go slowly. Her body and all of its senses are heightened now. The instincts you normally would have, to go right in and stimulate her vagina, might be too much and too fast, in her state." Kate nodded with understanding.</p>
<p>Nick crouched down between Kate's legs. He reached forward and began to spread her outer labia apart, revealing her silky, bright pink flesh nestled amongst the dark mass of pubic hair. He gently stroked her, finding her slick and fragrant, and sensitive to the touch. He observed her every response to his contact, getting a sense of where to focus his attention, and for how long.</p>
<p>Before long, he was salivating at the idea of going in for a taste. He nestled in between her legs and began to explore and pleasure her with his tongue. She immediately began to moan, tensing up and vanishing into herself, as if put in a trance. Allison held back on offering too much commentary and coaching, as she saw how receptive Nick was to her responses. She watched as Nick's tongue licked and sucked at the delicate pink flesh of Kate's pussy. Seeing Kate quiver and jerk her hips, Allison intuitively understood and felt her pleasure, briefly imagining being in Kate's place, and allowing Nick to get to know her body so intimately.</p>
<p>"Oh god, Nick..." Kate groaned, as she gently fondled her own breasts. She bucked her hips suddenly, surprised by a flash of raw pleasure. They all laughed at her startled reaction.</p>
<p>"Sorry," said Nick.</p>
<p>Kate giggled. "It's okay," she said, gazing down between her legs at her own vulva. "Look how swollen and wet my pussy is, just like she said!" she laughed. Nick grinned. "It's your fault! You did this to me!"</p>
<p>Nick sat back up, wiping his mouth and chin which had become coated in Kate's creamy juices. Allison's body was on fire. The smell of her friend's pussy, so much reminiscent of her own private arousal, only made it worse. If Allison couldn't have Nick, she wanted to at least slip her hand down, into her panties, and scratch the burning itch that pulsed there. But she just couldn't do that in front of them. Unable to stand it anymore, she panicked, and tried to distract herself with words.</p>
<p>"Now that you're paying attention to the evolving sensitivity of her breasts and genitals, you can apply the same attention and care to lovemaking. So why don't you try one of the positions we talked about now? Which one would you like to start with?" asked Allison.</p>
<p>"I'd like to straddle him, face to face. Do we need a chair?" replied Kate.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, as long as you're comfortable."</p>
<p>Nick moved to the edge of the bed so that his legs could hang over the side. Allison slid over to his side, and sheepishly looked down at his upright, erect penis which wavered back and forth in his lap. Kate got off the bed and circled around to face Nick.</p>
<p>Allison continued, "Now you're going to sit on Nick's lap, facing him so you can look into each other's eyes. Take his penis..." She trembled with emotion for Nick and for his aroused body as Kate reached forward and grabbed his erect member. "Now guide it into your vagina as you sit on his lap. You can wrap your legs around his body."</p>
<p>"Ngh..." Kate softly moaned as she guided his penis between her legs and let it sink inside her tight canal, while resting her body into his lap. Allison sat close enough that Kate's warm breath softly graced her cheek after moving across Nick's neck. "There's nothing more perfect than feeling you deep inside me..." she whispered to him, her eyes filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Nick started breathing deeply, as he felt her vaginal walls closing around his cock, squeezing it tightly, as if claiming ownership. He wanted to reply to her. He wanted to tell her how wonderful it felt. But with Allison right there next to him, he still felt so conflicted. He gazed back at her with a warm smile.</p>
<p>"Now you can make love this way, if it feels comfortable. It permits deep penetration of his penis into the vagina and back toward the cervix, while not possessing some of the risks of other positions. I also fosters an emotional connection when you can look deep into each other's eyes," Allison said. She couldn't believe she was following a script meant for husbands and wives; for people in love with one another.</p>
<p>Kate and Nick began to make love. Slowly, deliberately, and in a deeply connected state. Their eyes remained fixed to one another, with a desperate, loving gaze. It was painful for Allison to watch, as Kate's body remained taut with intense pleasure; her body sweetly rising and falling upon his with tender affection. Nick softly moaned as his engorged cock throbbed with pleasure. Allison found herself gazing at it; thick and long, and coated in Kate's cum as it stretched her pussy and sunk in and out of her dripping, pink hole.</p>
<p>"Oh god, oh god, yes..." Kate whimpered, wrapping her arms around him. Together they looked down at her pregnant belly, which they both supported between their undulating bodies.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with pleasure, Nick finally breathlessly uttered, "Mmmgh, Kate..."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, baby, tell me! Tell me what you're feeling..." she whispered into his ear.</p>
<p>Allison could tell how special and romantic they were feeling in this position, remaining actively connected to one another, and full of intense emotion. Slowly, she was dying inside. She wanted Nick so badly that she didn't know how much more she could take.</p>
<p>"Ngh, Kate..." Nick repeated, lost in a haze of pleasure. "It feels so good..." he said, writhing his hips uncontrollably against hers. "Ohh god... your sweet wet pussy..." he moaned, as he watched his cock sinking inside her body and emerging coated in a sticky film.</p>
<p>"Yes... yes baby... it's all for you... feel my wet pussy take you deep inside..." she cooed into his ear.</p>
<p>Allison was shaking with frustration and sexual feelings. Her own pussy was on fire, and she could feel it leaking and staining her panties.</p>
<p>As Nick and Kate went deeper into their lovemaking, it only made Allison feel worse. They began to try each one of the positions that she recommended. Kate got on her hands and knees and Nick plunged himself inside her from behind, rubbing and squeezing her ass as his erect penis moved through her like a piston. Allison could see how he lost control; how badly and urgently he wanted Kate's body. They tried spooning, and having Kate ride Nick as he lay down on the bed. All the while, Allison was forced to instruct them on how they should maximize their enjoyment together, and feel closer than they ever had before.</p>
<p>It was agony, watching their sweet, sensual lovemaking, so enamored by each other's body and the intimate access they provided each other. She could read the hunger and fulfillment in their eyes, she could smell the strong scent of their sex intermingling in the air. She could see how much they apparently cared for each other, and doubted her own place in the partnership.</p>
<p>Finally Nick began to tremble and moan louder, as Kate bounced slowly up and down on his cock. She let her boobs bounce freely and her pronounced nipples dance happily in the air above his drunken gaze. Sensing his pleasure peaking, Kate asked, "Baby, do you need to come? Do you want to come inside me?"</p>
<p>Nick nodded frantically. Kate held her belly and began to bounce faster against his aching body. He began to urge his hips against hers with equal urgency.</p>
<p>"Come for me, baby!" she exclaimed excitedly. "I want your cum inside me! Fill my wet pussy with your cum, just like when we made a baby together!"</p>
<p>Allison stopped breathing as she watched his cock pumping through her hairy mass of sloppy-wet pubic hair, deep into her gaping pink canal, aching to release itself and flood her from the inside.</p>
<p>"Ohhh fuck... Kate!" he exclaimed as his body tensed up and shuddered with spasms of pleasure. Kate squealed with delight as she felt him squirting, pumping waves of warm semen inside her. She leaned forward against his body and they took each other in an embrace, as he finished releasing himself.</p>
<p>Allison felt a rush of panic fill her from within, as her heart started racing. Dark thoughts ran through her head, such as the doubt that she'd ever have a chance to share such an epic moment with Nick herself. She felt dizzy and lightheaded. She wanted to lie down, but she was embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Um... I think I'll go get a glass of wa--" Allison began to say, as she rose from the bed. However, her legs went weak, and she stumbled. Nick slid over to the side of the bed quickly, grabbing her hand.</p>
<p>"Are you okay? What's the matter?" he said, frantically.</p>
<p>"Nothing... just... a little dizzy all of a sudden..."</p>
<p>"Okay, well have a seat. Don't get up so fast."</p>
<p>Allison returned to the bed and sat at the edge, holding her head.</p>
<p>Kate turned to Nick and said, "Why don't you go get cleaned up. I'll take care of her." Allison nodded at him in agreement, still embarrassed by what happened.</p>
<p>"Sure?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah," replied Allison. "I'm sorry I interrupted you!"</p>
<p>"No problem! We had just finished," Kate said with a grin, rubbing Allison's back.</p>
<p>Nick left the room and went to the bathroom. As he began to clean up, he reflected on what happened. The more he thought about it, the more he was able to focus on how bad he felt about Allison, instead of how enjoyable his experience with Kate was. Before long, he was starting to regret dragging her back into the situation, and wondered if he'd risked everything that their relationship had become.</p>
<p>After several minutes, he returned to the bedroom and found Kate and Allison sitting there with a serious expression on their faces. They both looked up suddenly when he arrived, with wide eyes. Nick could see that Allison was visibly shaken.</p>
<p>"What happened?" he asked, nervously.</p>
<p>"Uh... I think you'd better come here and sit down with us..." Kate said, patting the bed. "We need to talk." Nick felt a pang of fear. He slowly moved to the bed and sat beside them.</p>
<p>Kate continued, "I... um... just had a little talk with Allison. And... uh... she told me that the two of you have been becoming a lot closer as friends..." Allison gave Nick a wary expression. "I really had no idea you'd been spending so much time together! But... that's exciting! I guess I just didn't realize that this would be difficult for Allison to, you know, witness now."</p>
<p>Nick gulped and nodded at her.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Kate resumed, "Allison confessed that she's... um... developing strong feelings for you, and hasn't really had a chance to tell you that..." Allison was shaking. She looked down at Nick's hand and noticed he was shaking too. Kate paused for a moment, observing them, finding it romantic how much they trembled at this pivotal moment in their relationship.</p>
<p>"Allison got dizzy because she was watching us make love and feeling a lot of frustration because of that. I feel awful that I didn't know... but..." Kate stopped for a moment, and then smiled. "Let's just cut to the chase here. Allison wants you. Really badly. I mean... fuck, she can't get through a single day without touching herself and pretending it's you."</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"Kate!" Allison said, turning bright red.</p>
<p>Kate laughed. "I'm just telling him what you told me!"</p>
<p>Allison blurted, "You don't have to tell him that part!" She hid her face in her hands. Far from being embarrassed for her, Nick's heart soared with excitement and he smiled at Allison.</p>
<p>Kate, still chucking, added, "Look-- the point is, she's as hungry for your body as I am, and I certainly don't mind sharing-- sooo... how do you feel about all this?"</p>
<p>Allison looked up at Nick suddenly. He glanced back at the two women, silently awaiting his response, as if he'd really be able to find and produce any coherent words after what he just heard. Nick struggled to collect himself, and then said, "I-- um... I can't stop thinking about Allison. I can't get through the day without having her on my mind, any more than I can get through the day without breathing." He saw Allison's eyes tearing up.</p>
<p>Kate laughed, seeing the two of them frozen and breathless. "You can breathe!" she exclaimed. Nick and Allison both laughed and inhaled deeply. Kate added, "Oh my god, this is so cute! You two are secret love birds. I had no idea!" Allison gave her an embarrassed smile.</p>
<p>After a moment of being lost in thought, Kate continued, "So... you've obviously... never been together. Like Nick and me, I mean." Allison tensed up and shot her a scared look. She slowly shook her head no. Kate grinned back at her. "Well then, what are you waiting for?!" she giggled. "The floor is yours!"</p>
<p>Kate slid off to the side of the bed to make room for Allison and Nick. She crossed her legs and sat patiently, still naked and aroused from her session with Nick, and ready to share the fun with her friend.</p>
<p>Allison looked at her in horror. Her jaw quivered and she began shaking even more than she had been. Allison and Nick exchanged nervous glances. She was barely able to make eye contact with him. She couldn't believe what Kate was suggesting. She had proposed that she take off her clothes and join them in their state of nakedness, then make love to Nick for the first time, right there in front of Kate, just like that.</p>
<p>Panic set in. Allison's insecurities rose up. She froze in place, ready to reject the notion out of sheer embarrassment and fright, despite the fact that she wanted nothing more than to make wild, passionate love to Nick.</p>
<p>"O-okay..." said Nick, struggling to speak.</p>
<p>"O...kay..." replied Allison, surprising herself by angrily defying the fears that were trying to prevent her from achieving her goals. A million thoughts ran through her head. She couldn't believe she'd just accepted an invitation to sex with Nick. Just moments from now, she'd be naked in front of Nick. He'd be fucking her, just like she always wanted. She was terrified and excited all at once.</p>
<p>Kate watched them with fascination and absolute arousal, anticipating how romantic it would be, witnessing Nick seeing Allison's body for the first time, watching them make love, experiencing their very first moment of intimacy together. She wanted to see the precise moment, when two people, feeling a deep love for each other, felt their naked bodies connect for the first time, so perfectly and intimately.</p>
<p>"Go on..." said Kate, "Join us! Take off your clothes, Allison."</p>
<p>Allison shot a look back and forth between Kate and Nick. They both appeared to be watching her expectantly, just sitting there and waiting for her to bare her naked body. Allison wondered what Nick would think of it, what his reaction would be like, seeing her with no clothes on. She was surprised to not be more anxious about Kate's presence in the room, but realized at this point that she wanted Nick so badly that she wouldn't care of the whole town were there watching them.</p>
<p>Allison's trembling hands lifted from her lap as she silently reached for her top. With just this one single movement, the fact of what was about to happen became instantly real for Nick. He was about to make love to Allison for the first time. His penis quickly grew once again, becoming fully erect in a matter of seconds until it began to lift from his lap into the air. Allison watched him growing in front of her eyes, at the mere thought of seeing her naked, and it made her confidence grow.</p>
<p>She pulled her top over her head, and shimmied awkwardly out of her jeans. Allison found herself sitting on the bed in just her bra and panties, frozen again with fear and uncertainty. Nick aggressively toured her body with his eyes. He observed the slender line of her body, the soft bulge of her breasts around the cups of her bra, the smooth curve of her hips, and the soft mound between her legs, hidden behind the delicate fabric of her panties.</p>
<p>Allison felt herself reaching the point of no return. There was nothing left to do but reveal her private parts to the man she loved for the first time. Her rapid breath accentuated her breasts, which she hoped he would find as beautiful as Kate's. She panicked at the fact that she hadn't shaved down below recently, but quickly reminded herself that Kate was twice as hairy as she was. She tried to convince herself to move, to do something, anything, to prevent her from appearing to stall.</p>
<p>"Geez, come on girl! Look at him!" Kate laughed. "He wants to see those boobies so badly that I think he's gonna burst!"</p>
<p>They all chuckled. As awkward as it was having her friend in the room, Allison realized that Kate was nevertheless a tension reliever. She felt bad that she ever felt any jealously toward Kate. After all, she wouldn't be in the present situation if it weren't for Kate's suggestion. There was no question in her mind now that Kate was a true friend.</p>
<p>"Do you... can I help?" Nick asked, observing Allison's struggle. He felt bad that she was afraid, and wanted to relieve her of all her fears, so that they could share this moment together without any obstacle.</p>
<p>"Oh... okay..." Allison said, taking a deep breath.</p>
<p>Nick slid over the bed sheets until he was directly in front of her body. Allison looked down at his massive, swollen penis, revealing his absolute desire for her. She focused on his dramatic display of manhood for motivation, as Nick slowly reached around behind her back and began to undo her bra.</p>
<p>As Nick unhooked the strap and released some of the tension against her body, he saw the tight bulge of her breasts soften, as if anticipating their momentary freedom. He could hear Allison breathing deeply and quickly as he gently pulled the bra away from her body. All at once, Kate, Nick, and Allison herself were gazing down at her newly exposed breasts as they fell free from the cups and settled into place.</p>
<p>Nick's heart stopped the moment he saw Allison's breasts spring out into the open. They were perfectly bell shaped, separated by a sexy, deep chasm. Allison's medium-sized areolas were soft pink surrounding perky, reddish nipples. Her boobs were smooth and gently rounded, softly rising and falling with her heavy breathing, and slightly paler than the rest of her body, calling attention to the alluring fact that they were normally kept hidden.</p>
<p>He reached out with his hand and gently moved his palm over her bare flesh, caressing the soft curve of her left breast and running his fingers over her nipple as it quickly hardened. Nick could feel her warm body trembling as he touched her breasts, now with both hands, feeling them softly resist the pressure of his curious fingers.</p>
<p>Allison melted when she looked up and saw Nick's expression of deep longing and wonder. She closed her eyes and reveled in the erotic sensation of his hands exploring her half-naked body. When she opened them, she found him staring straight back at her with desperation. She reached out and caressed his face.</p>
<p>Nick fell forward, burying his face in her cleavage and inhaling deeply. He ran his nose between the warm globes of her breasts, feeling them sway and wiggle in response to his touch. She arched her back slightly, offering herself to him, and he began to cover them with kisses, finding his way to her nipples. He took them in his mouth one by one, suckling and teasing them with his mouth and tongue. Allison began to moan, absorbed by the sensation of her body connecting with his for the first time.</p>
<p>No sooner had Allison slipped into a state of blissful calm did she find her heart racing again, feeling Nick's hands slipping down along her body toward her panties. She felt herself instinctively falling back onto the soft bed sheets, feeling the movement of her breasts as they swung freely upon her chest. This was it. She was about to bear herself completely to Nick; no more walls, no more secrets. She longed for Nick to finally touch her vagina; to explore it and adore her body.</p>
<p>Nick's chest moved in and out with the heavy force of his breath, as he finally reached the elastic band of her panties and gripped it tightly. He found himself momentarily drowning in Allison's glossy eyes as she smiled, giving him wordless permission to slide down her underwear and reveal the jewel of her femininity to him.</p>
<p>He felt his cock throbbing and aching uncontrollably as he began to move her panties down over her hips, little by little. Nick watched as the tight band slipped over her pubic mound, instantly revealing a smooth triangle of short, dark brown hair. As he continued, Nick stared in amazement at the appearance of the two, soft lips of her pussy as they came into view. They were delicate and rounded; pinkish, with just a thin, light layer of pubic hair.</p>
<p>Nick quickly slid her panties off the rest of the way and tossed them aside, returning to the object of his affection. Allison's heart beat madly as she stared back at her new lover, so deeply enamored by the sight of her pussy. He quickly reached out and lovingly caressed her soft flesh, just as he had done with her breasts. He parted her outer lips, finding her pink and wet inside.</p>
<p>Their eyes connected as he slowly moved one finger inside her, feeling it glide smoothly through her tight canal, already slick with arousal. She bit her lip and quivered with hunger for his body, wanting more than ever to feel him inside her.</p>
<p>Kate watched breathlessly as Allison reached out and took hold of Nick's erect penis for the first time. She knew what that had been like, the first time she touched it. How hard and long it was. How badly it throbbed with pleasure and excitement. She watched the sense of wonder and erotic glee as Allison ran her fingers down his shaft to caress his testicles, and then back up toward the tip to slowly rub the thick knob of his sensitive head.</p>
<p>Kate instantly knew Allison's every desire, knowing how to read her expressions, feeling her every desire communicated from one woman to the other. She knew what Allison wanted next, and had every intention to guide her there.</p>
<p>"Do it," Kate whispered to Allison. "Taste him. Smell him. Take his penis in your mouth. Feel how badly he wants you." She watched the trembling couple as Allison moved herself nearer to Nick's crotch. She wrapped her hand around his massive cock which stood proudly before her eyes, desperate for her wet lips. Kate witnessed the dam finally burst, as Allison threw herself upon Nick's naked body, devouring his cock whole, and sucking him furiously.</p>
<p>She worked his cock as if her life depended on it. Nick groaned as she licked the full length of his shaft, and tickled his balls with her tongue. She twisted her hand around the base of his manhood while massaging the head with her warm tongue. She stroked him excitedly, watching the precum form at his tip, and then swallowed him again, hungrily sucking the salty, sticky fluid from his cock. She could feel him straining with pleasure. She could smell his incredible arousal; the musky, manly scent of his surging cock. She felt her body tingling and growing increasingly wet; for which there was only one possible cure.</p>
<p>"Oh Nick..." she moaned, suddenly wrapping her arms around his warm, naked body. "I've dreamt of that for so long! Every day I imagine kissing your penis and giving you so much pleasure... I love your body so much!"</p>
<p>Nick smiled back at his teary-eyed lover, feeling their naked bodies pressed together with so much energy and excitement. Welling up with emotion, he replied, "I think about it every day too! The softness of your skin, the feel of your breasts, feeling how wet and aroused you would get, tasting you..."</p>
<p>"Yes! Nick, I want to give that to you... taste me..." she exclaimed, burying her face in his neck. "Please! I want you to eat my pussy!" She couldn't believe what she was saying. It was as if someone else were speaking for her. Someone much braver than she was.</p>
<p>Allison threw herself back onto the sheets again, spreading her legs apart and inviting Nick to enjoy the most intimate parts of her womanhood. She ached for the pleasure she knew he could give her, the release she so badly wanted. Fueled by her mad lust for him, Nick rushed between her legs, enamored by the sight of her pink, glossy flesh spreading wide before his eyes. He inhaled deeply and filled his nostrils with the beautiful, feminine aroma of her aroused pussy. Then he ran his tongue across her sweet, velvety flesh and tasted her for the first time.</p>
<p>It was love at first taste, as Allison's creamy wetness coated his tongue. He drove it over her labia and then deep inside her vagina, hungry for her sweet nectar. Allison began to moan. Nick could feel her entire body tense up with pleasure. He explored every inch of her beautiful pussy with his curious tongue, anxious to know every delicate fold, every inch of her flesh. Soon her clit became raised and engorged, as if blooming before his eyes. He ran his tongue around it, massaging it gently and feeling her squirm all around him.</p>
<p>"Oh fuuuck! Nick!" she screamed, reaching down to clutch his hair. She pressed his face gently against her pubic mound as he worked her clit with his tongue, crying out with pleasure as she felt herself coming on his lips and tongue.</p>
<p>Despite having just suffered such pleasure herself, Kate found herself overwhelmed with raw excitement at the sight of Nick and Allison enraptured with each other's body. She cupped her breast as she reached down and rubbed herself furiously, coating her fingers with her own juices as she intuitively shared her friend's unbounded pleasure.</p>
<p>"Nick!" said Allison, as he pulled her up into his arms. She threw herself against his body, huffing and puffing. "I want your cock-- I want to feel you inside me!" He lifted her face until they were eye-to-eye. "Fuck me, Nick!" she exclaimed, almost out of breath.</p>
<p>Allison grabbed Nick's penis and guided it between her legs as he lowered her into missionary position. She gazed in astonishment at the sheer size of his engorged cock as he positioned it frantically at the entrance of her vagina. Her lustful gaze burned fiercely back at him as Nick urged his cock inside her, feeling Allison's pussy stretch and receive his tingling member.</p>
<p>Immediately their bodies began to writhe together, smoothly rocking back and forth as he glided inside and out. She looked down at his cock as it drove back and forth through her gaping hole, and began to laugh with joy. He began to laugh as well, feeling months of pent up sexual frustration starting to release all at once. Mesmerized by her gorgeous breasts dancing up and down on her chest, he continued to fuck her with wild abandon.</p>
<p>His lover's expression was a mixture of shock and bliss, as she fervently jerked her hips with an unquenchable desire to feel his penis penetrate her body as deep as it could possibly go. They fucked relentlessly, seemingly unable to tire now, only wanting more and more from one another.</p>
<p>Allison pushed Nick back onto the bed, and with a wild look in her eye climbed atop his body and stuffed his erection back into her dripping pussy. She began to ride him aggressively, squatting on his cock, becoming increasingly vocal, without a shred of the fear or embarrassment that was observable just a short while earlier.</p>
<p>Kate watched the wonderful display of raw emotion and sexual hunger set lose before her, feeling a surge of pride for having made it happen. She felt privileged to be able to watch her friend riding her lover with such emotion and excitement, still laughing with joy at the sight of his cock penetrating her body, and pressing her chest forward to invite Nick to enjoy the sight of her bouncing breasts.</p>
<p>After some time, Nick rose upward from the bed, allowing Allison to continue to ride his cock in a seated position. She threw her arms around him, breathing quickly, covering him with kisses. They kissed passionately, until finally Allison pulled away and exclaimed, "Nick-- I love you so much! I love feeling you inside me! I love everything about you!"</p>
<p>"I love you too!" Nick laughed, softly grasping her breasts as she rocked excitedly back and forth on his cock.</p>
<p>"Are you still able to come? I want to make you come!"</p>
<p>"... I think so..." Nick groaned as she began to gyrate her hips faster and faster. When he felt himself growing closer to climax, he lowered her back to missionary position and began feverishly thrusting inside her. Moments later, Allison was crying out again as spasms of pleasure relentlessly tore through her body. Feeling Allison quaking with a powerful orgasm, Nick felt himself about to peak himself. He fucked her wildly, jerking his hips and watching her creamy cum glaze his cock until it was slick and slimy with her feminine emissions.</p>
<p>"I'm going to come!" he groaned, suddenly pulling out.</p>
<p>Allison lurched forward and began to pump his cock excitedly. "Come for me! Make me messy! I want to be covered in you!"</p>
<p>He gazed down at Allison's eyes, full of tremendous anticipation, before he felt himself erupt, squirting wildly across her chest, surprised at the amount of cum he could still manage after being with Kate earlier.</p>
<p>Allison felt the warm splash of seminal fluid splash across her face and neck, and then down over her chest. She laughed excitedly as the scent of fresh ejaculate filled her nostrils and emphasized the final release of her lover's total pleasure.</p>
<p>Kate watched as the couple threw themselves together in one final, loving embrace; sharing a passionate kiss, absorbed in their mutual love and the monumental act of making love together for the first time. She felt a great tenderness wash over her body as she observed Allison sweetly curling up beside Nick's warm body, tucking her face into his neck, with an expression of safety and security that she had never seen before in her friend.</p>
<p>Allison lay there swimming with emotion. Nick had been like no other man she had ever been with. Past lovers only seemed to expect pleasure from her, while putting little effort into what they offered in return. Nick, on the other hand, listened to her body. He understood the language of its subtle movements, the way it expressed what she was thinking or feeling. Moreover, he knew how to respond. He anticipated what she wanted from him, and he gave it to her with all the care and affection that she could possibly desire.</p>
<p>Yes, this is what it meant to make love while being in love. She had heard herself say it. She heard him say it. And most of all she felt it, in each and every tender touch that they shared.</p>
<p>A slow procession of pickup trucks screeched to a halt in front of the old home, on its journey to restoration of its former glory. Jeremy and his men hopped out and began the busy work of preparing for a long day of planting the assortment of new trees and shrubs that Claire had envisioned for the yard.</p>
<p>With the amount of work to do, there was no time to meet with Claire that morning. Jeremy set right to the tasks at hand, organizing his team and starting to plot out the morning ahead. As the morning wore on, Jeremy could think of nothing but finally taking a break to report the mid-day status to Claire, where things would then move on to a decidedly more amorous matter.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>"Hey Richie-- you can start putting the mulch down. I'm gonna go up to the house and ask about the fringe trees," said Jeremy, as he headed off toward Claire's house, at long last. One of his employees looked up and nodded. "If you have any questions, just come and get me," he added.</p>
<p>Jeremy hustled toward the front door, trying to not clue his team into anything, but anxious to visit Claire after a long morning of difficult work which only left him craving his new lover that much more.</p>
<p>"There you are," said Claire, as Jeremy entered the foyer, letting the front door swing lazily shut. She grabbed his bicep and pulled herself close to his body, pressing her lips firmly against his. He reached around and grasped her buttocks and gave it a squeeze. "You've gone and gotten all hot and sweaty without me!" she laughed. Jeremy chuckled.</p>
<p>Claire tugged him through the foyer and led him to the living room. "Come, lets get you out of these dirty clothes," she added, with a sinister grin. They frantically undressed each other until they stood naked together in the center of the room with a pile of clothing at their feet.</p>
<p>Jeremy glanced over at the large windows flooding the room with the diffused light of an overcast day. He said, "In here? With all the windows? What if someone walks by?"</p>
<p>"Your guys are working on that side now, right?" Claire said, pointing back toward the front of the house.</p>
<p>"Yeah... but..."</p>
<p>"Well, there you go then. What are you afraid of them seeing? These?" she said, cupping his balls playfully.</p>
<p>Jeremy laughed. "I dunno. If I were them, I'd rather see these," he replied, reaching up to caress her perky, apple-shaped breasts. Her pink nipples quickly hardened at his touch.</p>
<p>Claire bit her lip excitedly, as her excitement rapidly increased, especially after thinking about one of the other workers catching them in the act. She felt Jeremy beginning to grow in her hand. The head of his penis quickly swelled and slid over her palm as his shaft lengthened and grew firm to the touch.</p>
<p>"Maybe they'll see me take your big cock in my mouth and suck it," she growled excitedly. She felt wicked and dirty, and she was loving it.</p>
<p>Jeremy grinned. "Would you like that?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Claire, suddenly breathing in deeply and becoming taut with sexual tension. "Ngh, and they probably want to watch you eat my pussy."</p>
<p>"Oh really?" said Jeremy, sliding his hand between Claire's legs. "This pussy right here?" He moved his fingers back and forth over her soft flesh, parting it and finding her already silky and wet.</p>
<p>"Ngh, yes, right there," moaned Claire.</p>
<p>"Well let's give them a show then," said Jeremy with a grin.</p>
<p>He couldn't believe how playful Claire was. As terrified as he was that someone from his team might actually walk by the windows, he couldn't help himself. Lately, with Nick around, Jeremy couldn't stop thinking about the impact of being infertile on his sex life with Kate. Seeing them together, and knowing that it was the reason, caused it to weigh constantly on his mind. Sex with Claire was freeing. She didn't know, and probably didn't care about his situation. He could enjoy himself fully, free from all concern. It was an escape.</p>
<p>The two of them stumbled toward the couch, until Claire let herself fall backward onto the wide cushions. Jeremy crawled on top of her, watching her chest rise and fall with heavy breaths. He returned one of her sinister looks and then forced her knees apart, causing her to laugh with excitement.</p>
<p>Jeremy leaned down and buried his face between Claire's legs, intoxicated by her feminine scent. He slowly ran his tongue through her intimate parts, separating her labia and exploring her depths.</p>
<p>"Mgh! Yes! Jeremy!" Claire groaned.</p>
<p>Fueled by her quivers of pleasure, Jeremy began to help himself enthusiastically to Claire's sopping wet pussy, giving her long, slow licks, sucking at her swollen lips, and working his way slowly toward her increasingly swollen clit. Soon Jeremy could feel his chin coated in Claire's juices and felt himself throbbing with anticipation for the moment when he'd plunge himself inside her tight, slippery depths.</p>
<p>"Jesus... Jeremy... fuck!" she screamed, writhing in pleasure, as he began to flick his tongue across her clitoris while easing his fingers inside her body.</p>
<p>Moments later, they heard a door creak.</p>
<p>"Hello?" a voice called out. Jeremy and Claire froze. "Jeremy? We need your input here..."</p>
<p>"Shit, it's Richie. I told him to come get me if he needed something," whispered Jeremy.</p>
<p>"Did you leave the door open?" asked Claire.</p>
<p>They heard cautious footsteps in the foyer. Jeremy and Claire quickly sprang from the couch. She pointed to a bookcase for Jeremy to hide behind, and he hurried there. She ran to a small alcove near the entrance to the room.</p>
<p>Moments later, Richie stepped into view, glancing into the living room as if searching for Jeremy.</p>
<p>"Hey, Jeremy?" he called out again.</p>
<p>Jeremy's heart raced, watching Claire standing naked just inches from one of his employees. Her body was tense and pressed tightly backward against the wall, gritting her teeth and smirking at the same time. He wanted to laugh at the stark contrast of Claire on her tiptoes, with her boobs sticking out from her chest, and the little patch of dark pubic hair between her legs, compared to Richie in his dirty oversized dad jeans and faded oilskin jacket.</p>
<p>Richie seemed bewildered, and ready to give up. Jeremy breathed a sigh of relief as he stepped away from the living room and made his way back through the foyer. Claire and Jeremy heard the front door swing open and closed again.</p>
<p>They rushed out from their hiding places and embraced in the center of the room.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, I can't believe that actually happened," laughed Claire. Jeremy could feel her chest heaving against his.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I should have told him specifically to ring the doorbell or something," Jeremy laughed back.</p>
<p>"It's okay. That was kinda thrilling," she said with a grin.</p>
<p>"Well, shit. I'd better get going. Take a rain check?"</p>
<p>Claire nodded with an exaggerated pout, and they quickly started to get dressed. The interruption of their intimacy left Claire frustrated and craving more. Jeremy had stopped suddenly in the midst of a storm of pleasure that left her reeling and lacking in satisfaction.</p>
<p>Jeremy's phone rang. He pulled it out of his pocket and Claire caught a brief glimpse of Kate's photo flashing across the screen. Jeremy quickly silenced it and stuffed it back into his pocket.</p>
<p>"Who's that?" Claire asked, curiously cocking her head.</p>
<p>"Oh... uh..." Jeremy started, realizing what he'd done. He panicked, but knew he couldn't get out of it. He'd been purposefully not thinking about Kate whenever he was with Claire. He couldn't deal with the guilt and the lack of certainty about how she'd react if she ever found out what he was up to. But he also suffered the fear of how Claire would react if she ever found out he was married.</p>
<p>"That's... um... my wife," he said, not looking Claire in the eyes.</p>
<p>"... You're married?" Claire said, surprised.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Huh. I didn't know that. I didn't see a wedding ring and thought..."</p>
<p>"Well, landscapers tend not to wear our wedding rings on the job. With the risk involved," he mumbled nervously.</p>
<p>"Ah, that makes sense." Claire suddenly felt stupid, but shook it off. There was a moment of awkward silence. Jeremy finally glanced up at Claire, who was studying him thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"So... like... we're having an affair then! ... I'm a mistress now?" she said, finally, beginning to crack a smile. Jeremy was surprised to see that she appeared turned on by the idea.</p>
<p>"I... guess..."</p>
<p>There was another moment of silence.</p>
<p>"Well..." Claire said thoughtfully. "You know what we have to do..." She got a devilish grin on her face that sparked a surprise anxiety in Jeremy.</p>
<p>"... What?" he asked, hesitantly.</p>
<p>Claire took a few slinky steps in Jeremy's direction, before placing her hand on his chest.</p>
<p>"Does your wife work?" she asked. "Maybe I can sneak over sometime and we can fool around at your house..." Claire seemed enthralled by this idea. The risk of getting caught, just like a few minutes earlier, set her mind on fire. Her body lit up with excitement just thinking about it.</p>
<p>"Oh... uh... she's currently on leave..." Jeremy said, feeling his heart racing.</p>
<p>"Oh," replied Claire, with disappointment. "But is she ever out? Is there some time we can arrange a play date?" she asked, with a hopeful twinkle in her eye.</p>
<p>"Well... I know she'll be out for a while with a friend on Tuesday afternoon..." Jeremy answered. He couldn't believe he was saying this. He couldn't believe he was actually going along with Claire's suggestion, despite the risks. But she had command over him like no one but Kate had ever had before.</p>
<p>"Tuesday afternoon it is, then," said Claire, with a sly grin.</p>
<p>Jeremy smiled nervously back at her, unsure what he was getting himself into.</p>
<p>Tuesday afternoon couldn't have come sooner for Kate and Allison. Ever since they started bonding over their mutual attraction to Nick, they had started to become inseparable friends. It was comforting for Kate to have someone like Allison to talk openly to about sex. Allison felt strangely appreciative to Kate for loosening her up about the whole situation, and for helping her break through the wall that had been preventing her relationship with Nick from evolving. Now, all of a sudden, she and Nick were fucking every chance they got. And Kate was involved, having hosted a couple sessions in her own bedroom, where she and Allison took delight in sharing their mutual lover's body.</p>
<p>They had planned a whole afternoon together. They caught a movie, had lunch overlooking the river, popped into a few clothing stores. All the while they gossiped about Nick and about Jeremy. Kate listened with fascination to Allison's stories about the various other couples she had coached, and the juicy details about the sex lives of these strangers.</p>
<p>They ended up at a festive Mexican joint along main street. Allison soon found herself in a silly state, inspired by a jumbo margarita, which Kate eyed wistfully as she sipped on a soda.</p>
<p>"Can I ask you something?" Allison said with a tipsy smirk.</p>
<p>"Sure!" Kate replied.</p>
<p>"Do you ever... compare them? Like... do you think about who you like fucking more, between your husband or Nick?" Allison asked. She noticed three woman having a girl's day out at the table behind Kate. They all glanced over from behind their own margaritas, gawking at what Allison had just said. She'd spoken too loudly, but she was too buzzed to care.</p>
<p>Kate giggled. "Honestly, not really. The situation is more like... two heads are better than one." They both burst into laughter. "No, seriously. They're both fun in bed, just in different ways. They like doing different things to me. Their penises feel a little different, you know? But variety is the spice of life!"</p>
<p>Allison was getting quite a kick out of the women who were increasingly tuned into their conversation. She spotted them giving each other looks of amused disbelief.</p>
<p>"What's Jeremy's cock feel like?" Allison asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I dunno how to explain. The proportions are a little different, and he's sorta angled..." Kate cocked her head comically. "This way?" She motioned with her hand. They both laughed. "Maybe now that you're acquainted with our bedroom, you can try it out sometime," she added with a snicker. The women behind Kate almost spit out their drinks.</p>
<p>Allison laughed. "I can't believe you're inviting me to fuck your husband!"</p>
<p>Kate shrugged. "Share the wealth, I say," she said with a smile, before taking another sip of soda.</p>
<p>"Has he ever... I mean... since you and Nick have something on the side... does he... you know... have someone?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not sure. If he does, I don't know about her."</p>
<p>Allison sighed happily. "Yeah, life is good."</p>
<p>Kate nodded enthusiastically at her new BFF. "Tell me about it. A girl's got needs, you know?" she giggled. "It's like, I can call Nick up any time and just say, 'Hey, get over here, stud,' and suddenly he's there, and pulling his clothes off."</p>
<p>Allison snorted a laugh. "Oh my god, I could use me some of that right now."</p>
<p>Kate grinned. "Oooh, someone's drunk and horny," she laughed. She hadn't felt this excited and free to gossip about her sexual desire since going out with her girlfriends in college. "You should call him! Tell him to meet us at my place."</p>
<p>"Ha! ... Should I?" replied Allison.</p>
<p>"Sure! I may not be drunk, but I've got the horny part down pat!"</p>
<p>Allison whipped out her phone excitedly. "Okay, I'll do it!" She found it hilarious that Kate was such a bad influence, giving her permission to let go of her inhibitions and feel free to be naughty.</p>
<p>The phone rang and Nick answered.</p>
<p>"Hey you," she said. Kate could hear Nick talking on the other end. "Guess who's had two margaritas and can't stop thinking about your cock?" She said this loudly, to make sure the table of women nearby could hear. Allison felt a surge of adrenaline. She was on a high from the alcohol, a new friendship, and her newfound sexual freedom. She felt like a giddy school girl again.</p>
<p>"Yep!" she said, responding to Nick's answer. "Kate is here too! Do you want to meet us at her place?"</p>
<p>Kate smirked and leaned in closely. She heard Nick say, "But I still have one more..."</p>
<p>"They can wait! You have two hot girls here, ready for some sexy, naked action!" Allison replied, sarcastically. The women behind Kate started laughing. Kate could hear Nick laughing on the other end. Finally, Allison said, "Okay, see you there!" and hung up.</p>
<p>"See? What did I tell you!" laughed Kate. "It's like having a personal Rent-A-Cock!" Allison started laughing so hard she turned bright red.</p>
<p>Kate turned and flagged down a server, saying, "Check, please!"</p>
<p>Nick finished his appointment and checked the time. He figured he might just have enough time to visit with Kate and Allison before rushing to his last customer. "Duty calls..." he chuckled to himself, excited by the thought of two beautiful women vying for his attention.</p>
<p>As he drove back across town, Nick reflected on how it ended up taking a wild sexual escapade with Kate to uncover the true sexual tension between he and Allison, who had been the one that brought them together in the first place. What he apparently desired most was right there in front of him, and now everything was moving so fast. Of course, Kate was great. He had become addicted to her, to her body, to what they routinely shared together. But she was happily married, and he had to accept that deep down it was destined to remain physical only.</p>
<p>Allison, on the other hand? That was still an open question about how far it would go.</p>
<p>Pulling up to the house, Nick found Kate and Allison getting out of the car. Their eyes lit up when they saw him approach, and welcomed him with open arms and a pinch on the rear-end. Now that all the ice was broken between them, their encounters had become full of unfettered excitement.</p>
<p>"Hey there, hot stuff," Allison said with a grin. They kissed.</p>
<p>Kate came up behind him and slipped her hands around his waist, then found his crotch. "You can have his lips, I found what I want," she giggled.</p>
<p>They made their way to the front door together, carrying on in anticipation of their upcoming reverie. However, the moment Kate put her key in the lock and turned the knob, she couldn't have known that she was about to open a door both literally and symbolically. As she stepped inside, she made room for Nick and Allison to pass by and turn the corner, then make their way into the living room. As Kate shut the door, she heard a gasp.</p>
<p>Nick froze. Allison covered her mouth with her hand, as she felt Kate approach from behind. The three gawked at the sight of Jeremy sitting in his favorite chair, with his pants down to his ankles. Clare knelt by his feet, wearing nothing but a simple black thong, fiercely sucking his cock. She went at it with enthusiasm, filling the room with slurping sounds, deeply aroused by the powerful surge of pleasure that caused him to grow so massive before her very eyes.</p>
<p>A stream of thoughts had been going through her mind. What if his wife ever found out? Could she satisfy Jeremy more than his wife did? The experience of sucking his cock right in their own home was so erotically thrilling that she felt herself become more sexually charged than she ever had before.</p>
<p>Jeremy looked up suddenly, discovering the unexpected presence of his wife and her friends in the room.</p>
<p>"Oh-- shit!" he exclaimed, reacting with a start.</p>
<p>Clare's eyes darted over to the group. Her eyes widened as she spit out Jeremy's shiny cock. She gasped, just as Allison had done, and sprung to her feet, flinging one arm across her bare breasts.</p>
<p>"Oh my god! Shit-- I... Um..." she started, before trailing off and glancing at Jeremy.</p>
<p>Nick and Allison exchanged looks, not sure what was about to happen. Kate broke the silence.</p>
<p>"Hi honey!" she said, as cheerfully as she always was. She casually walked across the room and deposited her bags on the couch, then turned and smiled at Clare. "Who's your friend?" she added.</p>
<p>Clare blinked at Kate from a state of full-on bewilderment. She appeared suspicious as Kate held out her hand, but reluctantly shook it.</p>
<p>"This... uh... is Clare..." Jeremy managed to say, with difficulty.</p>
<p>"Hi Clare," said Kate, "Nice to meet you!" She looked Clare up and down, then looked over at Jeremy, who sat in disbelief, clutching his swollen cock to hide it from view. Kate gave him an expression suggesting that she was impressed with his choice.</p>
<p>Kate looked back at Clare's body, cocking her head. "Not bad!" she laughed. Clare swallowed suddenly and stood there trembling, unsure how to react. Kate giggled and walked away. "Anyway, you guys can finish up and then grab some dessert if you want. We scored cupcakes! I'll leave 'em on the counter." She waltzed into the kitchen as if nothing happened. Nick and Allison quickly followed, not wishing to be left in the room with Clare and Jeremy.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, Kate poked her head out of the kitchen. She saw that Jeremy and Clare had gotten dressed again.</p>
<p>"Is it safe?" said Kate, with a smirk, then walking back into the living room.</p>
<p>"Oh-- um... actually I was just leaving. I don't-- I mean... I'm sorry, I didn't-- we didn't think you'd be home, and--" Clare muttered.</p>
<p>Kate laughed. "Come here," she said, leading Clare to the couch. Clare hesitantly followed her and slowly sat down, shooting Jeremy a fearful look in the process. He offered her no reaction. Nick and Allison crept into the kitchen doorway to listen.</p>
<p>"So..." Kate began. "You've obviously been fucking my husband. Tell me about it. How did it start?"</p>
<p>Clare gave her a dumbfounded look. She began to respond, her voice quivering. "Well... I, uh, hired Jeremy to do some landscaping. I just bought a house." Kate nodded at her. Clare looked terrified at having been caught. "And I invited him to come inside. We sorted out what he was going to do and... I-- I mean, I dunno... one thing just led to another..."</p>
<p>Nick could see that Clare's eyes were shiny. Jeremy appeared to be surprised that she was starting to confess everything to his wife. Kate studied Clare for a few moments, then laughed again. "That's great! Tell me more!"</p>
<p>Clare looked shocked. "You're not mad?"</p>
<p>"Nope. I mean... not as long as you satisfy one condition, no exceptions."</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"You respect my right to watch, or join in, any time I want!" Kate giggled, before winking at Jeremy. Nick couldn't help but laugh too, knowing that this was exactly what Jeremy had said to her upon finding out about Kate and he.</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>Clare's eyes widened. Kate continued, increasingly giddy with excitement, "Now-- tell us. What else happened?"</p>
<p>Nick and Allison listened as Clare continued to confess everything that she and Jeremy had done. She revealed the details of their first encounter. She revealed how they wound up fucking. She confessed each and every passionate encounter after that.</p>
<p>When she was done, the room was silent. Nick and Allison stared at the two women. Jeremy kept standing in the corner, still in disbelief. Kate's mouth was hanging half-open.</p>
<p>"Wooow," she said finally. "That's hot!" she finally replied, fanning herself. Clare finally cracked her first smile. "There's only one thing left to do now..."</p>
<p>"... What's that?" asked Clare.</p>
<p>Kate stood up, turned to Nick, and began to beckon him closer with one finger. Nick made his way over to her with a smirk. She pressed her body closely to his, leaned against his lips, and gave him a hungry kiss.</p>
<p>Claire watched them, aghast. She turned and glanced at Jeremy, as if to see how he felt seeing his wife kissing another man. She was shocked that he didn't seem to react at all. Claire turned back to face Nick and Kate. Still stunned, she watched as Kate's hands traveled down along his body, coming closer and closer to his pants, until they began to undo his belt.</p>
<p>Kate quickly loosened Nick's pants and, grinning up at him, began to slide them down. Suddenly, and without warning, Nick's cock sprang free and danced stiffly in the air before everyone's eyes. Claire gasped. She looked Nick up and down, frantically trying to make sense of the situation. There she stood, having just been caught red-handed in an affair, only to witness Jeremy's own wife undressing a handsome, sexy lover of her own.</p>
<p>She swallowed hard, as her eyes finally settled on Nick's long, thick member. Her heart beat quickly, fueled by a mixture of confusion and arousal, as she tried to process the unexpected sight of this alluring man's erect penis. Frozen in awe, she watched Kate kneel down in front of him, in her own state of adoration, reaching out to lovingly caress his cock, which appeared to be quite familiar to her. She ran her nose along his swollen shaft, breathing in deeply, and sighing with satisfaction, then opened her mouth wide and accepted him inside.</p>
<p>Claire watched with fascination as Nick groaned and relaxed into a state of blissful relaxation, while Kate sucked and slurped enthusiastically at the massive cock she appeared to so thoroughly enjoy. Just as Claire began to lose herself in the erotic enjoyment of this frank display of sexual hunger, she received another shock, watching Allison circle around the couple until she stood before Nick with the same look that Claire gave Jeremy each time they met.</p>
<p>Allison began to remove her top, slowly and deliberately, as if to tease him. Once removed, she held it out to the side, letting it briefly dangle from her outstretched hand, and then finally drop to the floor. Next, she slid off her pants, just as slowly, extending her smooth ass out into the air, toward Jeremy and Claire. She flung her pants off to the side, and stood before everyone, reduced to just her bra and panties.</p>
<p>With a widening smile, Allison whipped her hair about as she reached back to undo her bra. Claire stared at her with shock and a tingle of jealousy as Allison's two perfect breasts popped free and bobbed playfully in the air, commanding Nick's rapt attention. Allison held her bra high in the air above her head for a moment and then cast it sarcastically behind her.</p>
<p>Finally, Allison tucked her fingers into the waistband of her panties and, eying Nick the whole time, moved them bit by bit down her long legs. Claire watched from behind as the thin fabric moved smoothly over the round curvature of Allison's butt, stretching as it went. As the long crack separating her two fleshy cheeks emerged, Claire glanced over at Jeremy, finding him also glued to the sight before them.</p>
<p>Within moments, Allison stood before Nick and Kate, fully nude, and then advanced toward them. Claire noticed that Nick seemed to be shaking with anticipation as she came near, until their bodies were close enough to touch. As Kate continued to help herself to his manhood, Nick plunged his face into Allison's chest, covering her breasts with frantic kisses that made her laugh. When he paused, she quickly pulled off his shirt, revealing his bare chest.</p>
<p>Claire felt someone's touch from behind and gave a startled reaction. It was Jeremy. She eased a little into his embrace. He could feel her trembling with uncertainty and confusion as he held her close. Claire felt her heart trying to beat out of her chest as Kate stood up and began to remove her clothes. She gawked as Kate's large belly and patch of pubic hair became visible, followed by her large, swollen breasts.</p>
<p>She gazed at the three naked, heavily aroused bodies standing before her, touching and caressing each other. A million thoughts raced through her head. Was this going to be her first orgy? Was she going to have sex with Jeremy and Nick in front of everyone? This was the sort of thing she only considered privately, in her own head, in a secret world that wasn't anything like real life. And yet here it was, happening right in front of her.</p>
<p>Soon they'd all be fucking together, out in the open, unashamed, watching and being watched. The explosion of excitement inside Claire was almost too much to bear. She felt herself tingling between her legs as Jeremy's hands softly moved down her body, and began to lift her top. He soon had it over her head, and left her standing there in her bra.</p>
<p>Jeremy spun Claire slowly around. He looked at her nervously, unsure how she felt about what was happening. After a moment of staring at him with wide eyes, she wrapped her arms around him and smiled. He smiled back, sighing with relief at her apparent acceptance. They enjoyed the sight of each other's nervous excitement, before continuing to undress each other until they were both naked. Claire devoured Jeremy's strong, sturdy nude body with her eyes, full of fear and anxiety about turning around and exposing her own naked body to the others.</p>
<p>She inhaled deeply, and then finally turned around, bashfully exposing herself fully nude before Kate, Allison, and Nick. They paused for a moment from their collective enjoyment to offer her and Jeremy warm smiles, and to take a look at their naked bodies, standing there together hand in hand. Claire shivered with excitement as she watched Nick examining her boobs, and then looking down between her legs at her exposed pussy. It was frightening and thrilling to be looked at in this way, with eyes so full of curiosity, fascination, and desire.</p>
<p>Kate followed as Allison led Nick to the couch, and pulled him down over her body. She knelt down beside them, watching them begin to fuck, excitedly slipping her hand down between her legs. Claire could feel Jeremy's cock growing against her bare bottom until it pulsed rhythmically against her soft flesh. He gently helped her down to the soft rug beneath her feet and laid her back. Claire sheepishly opened her legs, allowing Jeremy and the rest of the room a full view of her womanhood.</p>
<p>"I believe I still have something to make up for," he said with a smirk, referring to their close call with Richie.</p>
<p>Claire giggled and watched Jeremy sink himself slowly between her legs, parting her lips with his tongue and beginning to intimately explore her privates. Claire moaned instantly, already beyond the point of excitement due to the erotically charged atmosphere around her. She felt herself opening up to the experience; an experience she'd only dreamed of. Jeremy pleasured her enthusiastically for several minutes, as she closed her eyes and drifted off into a land of pure enjoyment.</p>
<p>When she opened them again, Allison and Kate had already taken turns and switched places. She watched as Nick's pelvis pounded against Kate's buttocks as they fucked doggy style on the couch. Her massive breasts swung like pendulums as her ass rippled with the force of his surging cock. The strong scent of sex lingered in the air all around Claire as she watched Jeremy reposition himself and prepare to enter her, with his engorged penis twitching excitedly at the prospect.</p>
<p>Minutes later, Claire glanced frantically around the room at all the faces aimed in her direction. She could not believe that they had all paused to watch her, apparently delighted that she'd been brave enough to join in. She could not believe that she lay on the floor with her pussy spread eagle in front of everyone, as her lover strained over her body desperately driving his aching cock inside her. She watched Nick's cock throbbing as he ran his fist up and down the full length of his shaft, all the while absorbed in the sight of her naked body. She enjoyed the sight of the arousal that she herself was the cause of.</p>
<p>As Jeremy's naked body convulsed with pleasure against hers, and she felt the rush of air against her breasts as they jostled about, Claire took so much delight in the taboo of baring herself this intimately to the strangers around her that one thing finally became clear. Something that perhaps deep down she always knew, but never dared to confront. She confirmed it to herself, repeating in her mind, "I'm an exhibitionist" over and over, as if needing to force herself to accept it. "I'm an exhibitionist!" she laughed to herself. "These people are watching Jeremy fuck me... and it's incredible!"</p>
<p>Claire felt a sudden surge of sexual freedom and she grabbed the reigns, sending Jeremy backward to the floor. She climbed atop his body and grasped his cock firmly with her hand. Moving herself over his pelvis, she finally guided him to her dripping, pink hole and forced him inside.</p>
<p>"Ngh, yes!" she cried out, before letting lose a joyful laugh. She sunk down onto his upright member and steadied herself against his chest with her hands. Claire began scooping her hips back and forth, driving her lover's cock deeper and deeper inside her body. She arched her back to put her boobs on display, letting them bounce playfully in front of the others, as if expressing her supreme enjoyment as she rode Jeremy's cock as wildly as she could.</p>
<p>The freedom of putting her naked body put on display, seething with intense pleasure, took her over the top. Claire's hair showered over her face as her nostrils flared and her grip tightened on Jeremy's clenched muscles. Her body convulsed against his as she aimed to coax out every last bit of pleasure she could with a frantic determination.</p>
<p>"Fuuuck! Oh my god! Fuck me! Fuck my pussy!" she screamed at him, as he urged his hips against her grinding body, his face awash with the look of desperation. She wanted everyone to hear. She wanted to make known to all what dirty thoughts she had in her head, and how badly she wanted Jeremy. Soon Claire could feel herself squirting and drenching his cock in her juices as waves of pleasure thundered through her body.</p>
<p>Inspired by the sight of their spirited fuck, Kate, Allison, and Nick resumed their action together in turns. All five of them continued to moan together in fits of passion, until Claire could take no more and collapsed backward onto the rug, staring up at the ceiling with glazed eyes.</p>
<p>Soon, Nick appeared by her side with a smile.</p>
<p>"You okay?" he chuckled.</p>
<p>She glanced over at him and laughed. "Yeah, wow..." she said, breathlessly, noticing that Jeremy had left her side. "I just need a second, then we'll be good to go." She grinned at him.</p>
<p>"We'll be good to go?"</p>
<p>"Oh... meaning... aren't we next? Like, are we switching partners?" She looked embarrassed. "Sorry I've never been to an orgy before."</p>
<p>"Oh! Sure, yeah," laughed Nick. He scanned her naked body, acknowledging that he undoubtedly found her attractive. At this point, he couldn't imagine there was any reason to hold back. Allison had long since expressed her understanding toward this lifestyle.</p>
<p>Jeremy approached his wife nervously, as she lay on the couch. He squatted down beside her, and she offered him a smile.</p>
<p>"Are you really... not mad about this? About Claire?" he asked, with some hesitation.</p>
<p>"Did you think that my request for an open marriage wouldn't go both ways? Of course you can have sex with other girls. As long as you always come back to me," she said. Then, still smiling, she leaned over to place a soft kiss on his lips. Jeremy's mind raced with excited thoughts. He felt like the heavy weight of guilt had been lifted off his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Come here baby," said Kate, pulling him close. They began to kiss lovingly.</p>
<p>Claire sat up and sheepishly moved Nick's leg aside, anxious to take a closer look at his penis. She ran her fingers softly along his shaft as it began to slowly grow again. She ran her hand over his smooth testicles and cupped them gently, watching his erection react with a stiff bounce. She began to stoke him slowly, feeling some resistance. He was still slightly wet from Kate and Allison's pussies. She could smell them on him, and yet still his manly scent broke through.</p>
<p>Claire trembled with excitement as Nick laid her back on the floor again. This handsome, naked man she only just met was about to put his erect penis inside her. She wanted to see him fuck her the way he fucked the other girls; with the same enjoyment and excitement. She wanted to feel their foreign bodies become suddenly known to each other, in a perfect, intimate union as they made love.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Allison approached.</p>
<p>"Boy, you're making out like a bandit!" she laughed at Nick.</p>
<p>He laughed and glanced up at her. "Is it okay?"</p>
<p>She smirked and nodded. Suddenly, she remembered Kate's comment at the Mexican restaurant, where she had offered Jeremy to her. Deciding to tease Nick with a dose of his own medicine, she said, "If you get to fuck her, it only frees me up to do what I reeeeally want to do."</p>
<p>"What's that?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I want to fuck Kate's husband," she announced, loud enough for Jeremy to hear.</p>
<p>Jeremy looked up in surprise and Kate grinned at her.</p>
<p>Allison turned to him and said, "What do you say, hot stuff? Do you want to stuff that big, manly cock of yours in my wet pussy?" She said this with much exaggeration, glancing occasionally at Nick to see if he was jealous. He smirked at her.</p>
<p>Jeremy gulped and glanced at Kate. "What are you waiting for, hot stuff?" his wife joked. He slowly rose from Kate's side and approached Allison with his stiff member wagging in front of his body. Allison eyed it hungrily and grasped it in her hand as his body grew close.</p>
<p>She led him to the floor, beside Claire and Nick, with a sinister grin and the obvious intention of teasing Nick by forcing him to watch them fuck. Despite his exciting affair with Claire, and his ability to engage it right in front of his wife, Jeremy was still taken aback by the sudden opportunity to fuck Allison. She was, after all, Nick's lover. Suddenly, he wanted nothing more than to fuck her in front of him. Not out of spite-- he'd long since come to terms with Nick's affair with Kate, but rather out of the sheer amusement of the situation, in which no one really remained tied to any one partner. The idea was still somehow unthinkable to him.</p>
<p>Allison suddenly couldn't believe what she was doing, as she invited Jeremy to come closer. He's naked body now lurked over her, and he sported a massive erect penis, the one that she and Kate had just gossiped about. As he positioned himself between her legs, Allison couldn't help but suppress a laugh. Kate had been right! There was an amusing, slight angle to his cock, just as she had said.</p>
<p>Jeremy's head was swimming with the excitement of knowing yet another woman's body intimately. Allison's breasts were full and beautifully shaped. He caressed them gently with one hand as he spread her legs apart with the other. He looked down at the gorgeous, private view he now had of her pussy. Her swollen, lightly hairy lips began to part, as the silky, pink flesh of her vagina began to peek through. His cock throbbed in waves of tingling pleasure as he further separated her labia with the head of his cock, before pushing it through the light mass of hair and deep inside her body.</p>
<p>Allison and Jeremy moaned together as their hips connected and his penis eased all the way into her warm, slippery depths. Their eyes connected as they began to move as one, syncing the rhythms of their bodies in an unexpected sharing of bliss.</p>
<p>Nick found himself strangely aroused by the sight of Allison's pleasure as she felt Jeremy's cock glide through her tight canal. She seemed to vanish into another world, a world he himself had only just begun to explore with her. He turned his attention back to Claire, who had paused to observe the reaction Nick gave Allison. She couldn't help but wonder what he was thinking, seeing her fuck Jeremy for the first time. This was all so new to her, and she didn't know what to think, or what to feel.</p>
<p>Nick's arousal at the sight of Allison and Claire lying side by side, hungry for each other's lover, gripped every fiber of his body. He cupped Claire's small, round breasts and felt their subtle firmness respond to his grasp. His cock found its way to her pink slit, where her dark trail of pubic hair just ended, and he forced it inside, feeling the tight walls of her pussy enclosing around his aching member.</p>
<p>Claire arched her back, moaning suddenly as she felt Nick fill her so perfectly and completely. Her sensitive nipples brushed against his palms as he caressed her jerking boobs while they began to fuck, slowly at first, and then faster and faster. She felt herself squeaking as her pussy, still dripping from her time with Jeremy, began to squirt again, coating Nick's cock in a slick film of her gushing juices. She could do nothing but subject herself to the sight of not one but two men driven mad with lust at the sight of her body as they groaned and thrust their hips with urgent desire.</p>
<p>Kate, low on stamina from her pregnancy, and still recovering from her own time with Nick, was content for the time being to watch the two men in her life enjoying themselves so freely with Allison and Claire. She watched their clenched, muscular buttocks swinging back and forth toward the girls' pussies. She could almost feel their desire, their hunger, their absolute pleasure as the two couples groaned and writhed together on the rug.</p>
<p>Kate slid her hand down and began to rub her swollen belly, smiling with satisfaction at the result of her own passionate encounters, at the most perfect reward for the lovemaking that she and Nick had shared, which now grew rapidly inside her with each passing day.</p>
<p>Allison let her bowling ball fly, and sent it careening down the lane toward the pins. Their perfect order and spacing glared back at her like a vicious taunt. Within seconds they exploded, tumbling into the air before they vanished into the darkness.</p>
<p>"Steeeeeeerike!" Nick exclaimed, as Allison turned and proudly stuck her tongue out at him in a show of competitiveness. "... Again," added Nick with a sigh, glancing up at the score. "I think the apprentice is about to overtake the master..." he mumbled.</p>
<p>"What can I say? I like playing with balls," joked Allison as she plopped down on the cushion next to him. She grabbed her empty glass. "Beer me," she said, extending it out in front of Nick. He began refilling her glass with the remaining beer from their pitcher.</p>
<p>"Six games... I need a short break!" he said.</p>
<p>Allison laughed. "You mean you need to reassess your strategy to figure out how to beat me," she replied with a grin.</p>
<p>Nick groaned and tickled Allison. She laughed, and they kissed.</p>
<p>"This is fun," she said.</p>
<p>"Yeah. This should be our new thing."</p>
<p>"Totally."</p>

<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>They sat for a few moments, drinking together and watching the other couples and families bowling around them. A couple lanes over, a man crouched down in front of the lane and helped his young daughter learn how to roll the ball. Allison grew quiet for a short time.</p>
<p>"Hey-- I wanted to ask you..." Allison began, hesitantly. She could feel the questions she normally avoided about to come out, thanks to the alcohol in her system. "Do you feel weird at all... that another woman is having your baby? Like, I know she's a friend and all. I mean, another couple is gonna raise the child..."</p>
<p>"Not really," he replied. "I guess I don't really think too much about it. I made someone happy, and that's all I need."</p>
<p>"But wouldn't you rather have a baby with someone you can be with? You know... like a child you can teach how to bowl and stuff." Allison added with a snicker, "And then someday beat your sorry ass."</p>
<p>Nick knew what Allison was getting at. She was testing the waters. He knew she wanted to be a mother someday, and given the state of their relationship, it was clear that she'd been considering the possibility of a life together with him. He didn't blame her, he was doing the same thing.</p>
<p>"Oh, sure," he replied, confidently. "I'll probably be out of the picture once their baby is born anyway. Then I can focus on raising a bowling campion." He grinned.</p>
<p>Allison smiled back at him. He could tell she was lost in a fleeting fantasy about such a thing happening in their future. She took a big gulp of beer and set it down on the table, then sunk into Nick's arm, resting her head on his shoulder.</p>
<p>It didn't take long before the sexual escapades that Nick found himself swept up into had progressed first from Kate and he trying to make a baby, to suddenly becoming a wild, sweaty orgy between three girls and two guys. As the month went by, they found themselves getting together once or twice a week for group sex, freely changing partners and enjoying the openness and sexual freedom of their new relationship.</p>
<p>What amazed Nick the most is that he and Allison continued to develop their normal relationship outside of these orgies, without any complications, only falling deeper and deeper in love with each other, and desiring each other more and more. While watching Nick fuck Claire doggy style, Allison got to witness a display of her lover's sexual desire in a way that she could only experience with the attention of an outside observer. It left her feeling closer and more in tune with his sexual desires than she ever would have been otherwise. Likewise, when Nick watched Allison riding Jeremy's cock, his excitement and anticipation only grew, as if he was watching a beautiful porn star about to emerge from the screen and have sex with him next, in real life. Even Kate and Jeremy seemed to continue to enjoy a happy marriage, despite the occasional fuck Nick and Kate shared, or that Jeremy and Claire engaged in.</p>
<p>The superficial passions they shared only served to fuel the deeper bonds they held with their true partners. Nothing could have made life more perfect, Nick thought... at least until one day when one of these group encounters suddenly surprised him with a little dose of deja vu.</p>
<p>"Oh really? Do you think you can handle a double team?" Claire giggled, as she climbed the stairs to Kate and Jeremy's bedroom.</p>
<p>"There's only one way to find out!" Nick laughed, chasing her up a few more steps, as he made a playful grab at her ass. Nick could not believe that Allison and Claire had decided to take turns sucking his cock. He couldn't stop looking forward to the sight of them each kneeling in front of him, passing it back and forth between their greedy lips.</p>
<p>Claire squealed and darted out of his way, as if he were a snapping turtle. She ran into Allison on the landing at the top, expecting her to have moved.</p>
<p>"Hey, lemme go!" Claire laughed.</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry, am I in your way?" Allison snickered as Nick arrived, still reaching for Claire's body.</p>
<p>"Ack!" Claire exclaimed as Nick began to tickle her. "No! Stop!" she shouted, howling with laughter as Allison joined in.</p>
<p>Nick pulled Claire's top off, excited by the fact that she had arrived without a bra. As Allison tickled Claire, she watched with zeal as Nick beamed at the sight of Claire's bare boobs bouncing and lurching about as she shrieked and tried to escape their playful advances.</p>
<p>"Stop, stop!" Claire kept laughing, finally collapsing to the floor. They stopped tickling her. She glared up at Nick.</p>
<p>"Oh, you're gonna get it now, buddy," she growled.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?"</p>
<p>"I'm gonna screw you six ways from Sunday..." she replied, diving after him and pushing him into the bedroom.</p>
<p>Jeremy and Kate were already inside getting undressed, and laughing at their friends' playful teasing. All at once, their clothes were yanked off and rained to the floor in scattered heaps. Nick never grew tired of the parade of naked bodies emerging all around him.</p>
<p>The girls surrounded Jeremy and Nick, grinding up against them sarcastically and watching their penises spring to attention. Before long, both Claire and Allison were making good on their threat. Claire watched hungrily as Allison went at Nick's cock with a visible elation.</p>
<p>"Hey now, what about me?" Claire said impatiently after a couple minutes. Allison smirked, despite her mouth still stuffed with Nick's erect cock. It popped out of Allison's mouth as she let out a long, satisfied sigh. A small trail of saliva traveled from the top of his head to her red lips.</p>
<p>Claire grabbed it excitedly, pulling his stiff member out of Allison's grasp. She spit on his cock and gave it a quick stroke, then plunged it into her own mouth. Nick groaned as he watched her head jerking back and forth, taking his member as deep as she could until it began to penetrate her throat.</p>
<p>By the time Allison got her turn again, Jeremy had already entered her from behind. The aggressive way he pounded her from behind sent her breasts swinging back and forth, and added a greater urgency as she began to suck Nick's cock once again.</p>
<p>Kate came up behind Nick, and begin to kiss his neck. He reached back and began to caress her pregnant belly and she smiled at him. Coming around to his side, he leaned down and began to suckle at her large breasts, a sight that Jeremy always enjoyed watching.</p>
<p>Before long, the five of them had made it to the bed. It was a whirlwind of sexual desire unleashed, as they grasped at each other's bodies, seeking mouths, grasping erections, plunging fingers into wet pussies. It didn't matter who was with whom, they enjoyed each other equally, and with absolutely freedom.</p>
<p>However, it wasn't long before Allison and Nick were drawn back together. They embraced, sharing a secret smile that illustrated their mutual love. They could never go long before returning to each other's body, like returning home after a long trip. Nick found himself intoxicated with a frenzied, sexual hunger, more potent than anything he had felt before. It continued to dawn on him just how magical sex became when one feels as close as he did to his partner.</p>
<p>The past week had been particularly critical for them as a couple, having both admitted the likelihood that they'd spend their lives together. Someday they'd buy a home, and perhaps even have a child together. The future and its infinite possibilities stretched out before them.</p>
<p>Nick looked around the room. Jeremy had scooped Claire up into his arms and was gently caressing her breasts as her glistening, naked body undulated in his lap. She gazed into his eyes as she ground her hips against him, receiving his cock with urgency. She seemed totally lost in his embrace. Kate stroked her husband's back and then leaned down to kiss his neck, as he shivered with pleasure. She pressed her swollen breasts against his flesh, and slid her hand down to his buttocks. Nick was mesmerized at the loving exchange of this threesome.</p>
<p>"Nick--" Allison said, suddenly interrupting him. He glanced back at the beautiful young woman laying before him, sharing her body with nothing left to hide, and aching for him to continue to enjoy all of her feminine charms. "Nick... I want..." she continued, appearing to struggle with what she wanted to say.</p>
<p>He cupped her breasts lovingly as he continued to move rhythmically against her body, gliding his cock back and forth smoothly between her legs, as the feelings of love and pleasure washed over him. "What is it?" he asked, discovering her eyes beginning to tear up.</p>
<p>"I--- love you so much!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I love you too!" he said, with a wide smile.</p>
<p>"I want... I want to have your baby, Nick! I was afraid to tell you earlier, but I want you to make me pregnant, just like you did for Kate," she said, with a burst of emotion.</p>
<p>"Really?" he said, surprised and delighted.</p>
<p>"Yes!" she said, encouraged by his positive reaction.</p>
<p>Nick paused for a moment, lost in thought. He imagined all the things that would entail. Experiencing her pregnancy, just like he was experiencing Kate's. Seeing her give birth. Raising their bowling champ together. "... Okay! ... Let's do it!" he exclaimed, emphatically.</p>
<p>Allison exhaled suddenly, as if she been full of fear and uncertainly, releasing it all at once. They burst into excited laughter.</p>
<p>"Really?" she said.</p>
<p>"Yeah!"</p>
<p>They looked down together as Nick began to thrust his cock harder and faster into Allison's sopping wet, pink canal.</p>
<p>In all the times they'd made love, Nick always finished on her breasts, or her stomach, or even in her mouth. Each and every time it was wonderful, feeling his body spasm with pleasure as he began to ejaculate, experiencing the pinnacle of his pleasure. And as much as she loved the sensation of the warm fluid spraying across her skin, it always left her longing for more. Each time she wondered what it would be like if one day he released inside of her, to feel him coming deep inside her body.</p>
<p>"Oh god, Nick!" she cried out. "Come inside me! Please come in my pussy!" she screamed, desperate to finally arrive at that moment together. Nick started groaning as they furiously thrust their hips against one another. He too could tell how desperate she was for his cock, and to feel him unload himself inside her.</p>
<p>She continued to scream, "Yes! Ugh, you make me so wet!" She writhed with tremendous pleasure. She leaned closer, egging him on and saying, "I love you so much! Nick... all I want is to feel you flood my pussy with your warm cum... please!"</p>
<p>"Oh god, Allison!" Nick moaned, feeling himself nearing orgasm.</p>
<p>"Nick! Ugh! Come for me! Let's make a beautiful baby together!" she exclaimed again.</p>
<p>He continued to drive his throbbing cock inside her with a wild, unrelenting passion. Her beautiful, wet pussy stretched as wide as it could to devour him whole, urging him to release everything he had pent up inside. "Allison!" he moaned. Nick felt a powerful wave of pleasure thunder through his body. All at once, his cock started spasming furiously, pumping wave after wave of cum deep into her waiting vagina.</p>
<p>Nick saw her eyes widen, as she felt the sensation of his semen erupting like a fountain inside her. It sent her into an instant fit of pleasure, and together they experienced a powerful orgasm at the same time. Their strained bodies clung together, aching and bursting with a violent fit of emotion and physical sensation. Together they felt precisely what Allison had begged him for; he flooded her with every last drop he had inside him.</p>
<p>When Nick snapped out of it, he discovered that Kate, Jeremy, and Claire had rushed to their side. They must have heard everything that Allison had asked for, and came to witness the event. He looked around at their excited faces. Kate quickly grabbed a pillow and inserted it beneath Allison's pelvis, realizing that in the heat of passion they hadn't engaged in any of the practices that were previously assigned to Nick and she.</p>
<p>"We're going to be mommies together!" Kate squealed excitedly. Allison laughed excitedly and they hugged.</p>
<p>The four of them gazed down excitedly at Allison's pussy; her pubic hair sloppy and wet, slick with sweat and semen. A white trail of Nick's cum began to slowly ooze forth from her vagina. Allison reached down and ran her fingers through it, then threw her head back with a blissful sigh. Nick watched her in wonder, sharing in her absolutely happiness, and knowing that this would be the start of something special.</p>
<p>Claire couldn't believe what she was witnessing, as the dribble of cum from Allison's pussy began to slow. She could smell Nick's intense arousal. Her nostrils caught the distinct scent of fresh cum and the feminine perfumes of Allison's body. She'd never seen anyone become impregnated before, and it sent shivers of excitement through her body.</p>
<p>Claire began to wonder when that would happen to her; when she'd be able to feel the supreme bliss of what Nick and Allison just shared together.</p>
<p>She remembered how good it felt when Nick had his penis buried deep inside her. She imagined what it would be like to feel him reach an orgasm. She wanted to feel the sensation of his cock surging with spasms as he came inside her, ejaculating load after load of warm seminal fluid into her tingling pussy as they clutched each other in a crisis of pleasure. The fantasy was so erotically changed and intense that she nearly brought herself to an orgasm just thinking about it. She felt a small pang of jealousy, watching Allison in her messy, post-coital state.</p>
<p>Claire began to rub Nick's back soothingly, as if to congratulate him. He turned and smiled at her. She felt a tenderness that she wanted to be a part of, a tenderness only felt when she'd let someone come inside her, to become pregnant together.</p>
<p>"Someday," she thought, consoling herself, and gazing quietly at Nick. "Someday..."</p>
<p>For ten minutes, they lounged naked together on the clumping bed sheets, in this state of mutual bliss and sexual satisfaction. Allison imagined her body merging with the results of her union with Nick, overwhelmed with excitement for what the future would bring.</p>
<p>Jeremy gazed with admiration at his wife, and at her pregnant body, then at his new lover, Claire, as she continued to enthusiastically open up to the experience of sexual adventure that had now been offered to her.</p>
<p>Kate and Claire exchanged a warm and welcoming smile, feeling a strange closeness forming, despite the shocking way they so recently met. So many questions remained for Claire about the future, and yet she instinctively knew she would love the answers.</p>
<p>The heady mix of sweat and sex lingered in the air, arousing yet soothing, urging their nude bodies together into a tender closeness. Nick curled up by Allison's side, holding her hand.</p>
<p>They leaned into one another, silently speaking volumes with their eyes, as the others wrapped their arms around them, until the cocoon of bodies may as well have fused into one.</p>
