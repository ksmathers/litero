<p>For Badiha, life was about a series of moments, she could look back over her achievements and narrow it down not to hard work or perseverance, but to one or two instances of doing the right thing at the right time. This was her talent.</p>
<p>When she had university interviews to study biochemistry, she decided to at least try for Oxford, even though her predicted grades were below what was expected. During the interview, she noticed her interviewer had the telltale signs of being on a cocaine comedown. No other student had the insight and background to inform him that a hot shower followed by a couple of benzos (that she provided) and a nap would get him to the other side better than ever. The efficacy of her cure was confirmed when she found Oxford drastically dropping her offer for "an acute display of practical biochemistry during the interview process."</p>
<p>Badiha found Oxford very different to her native Tower Hamlets, full of the peppy and pompous she found herself falling back on her classic pastime of selling drugs. She knew the various pill popping partiers and Adderall pumping study addicts and managed to work both groups well enough to keep her comfortable. But once again when the moment arose, she could see it and take it.</p>
<p>Outside one of her usual spots she noticed a girl who stood out hard, nervously approaching her. At first she wondered if this was another police sting, but when the girl got closer, she saw the designer clothes, expensive hairstyle and sparkling jewelry. It was clear this was not someone in need of money enough to work for the cops.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I'm new to this but... do you... you know..." she awkwardly spluttered.</p>
<p>"Sell drugs? Why yes, I do sell drugs." Badiha boisterously replied, enjoying the squirming of her potential customer.</p>
<p>"Oh, OK. So... I'd like some ecstasy please."</p>
<p>"No problem, how much?"</p>
<p>"Um... I don't know." The girl was so out of her depth that Badiha knew she could take her for all that she was worth, but her intuition told her this could be a defining moment so she decided to take a different tact.</p>
<p>"Alright, I understand. What's your name?"</p>
<p>"It's Olivia."</p>
<p>"OK Olivia. I'm guessing this is a first for you so let's guide you through it. Are you buying for a party?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Good, and I'm guessing you're all trying pills for the first time."</p>
<p>"There's a couple of girls who say they use all the time..."</p>
<p>"If they were telling the truth they would have had someone's phone number, you wouldn't be talking to me on the street. I'll tell you what, take me with you. I'll keep you supplied throughout the night, make sure everyone is safely enjoying their first time, consider me the sparkle of your party."</p>
<p>Olivia was initially hesitant to agree to such an offer, but Badiha was friendly and accommodating enough and soon she found herself the centrepiece of the Oxford Women's Horse Riding Society's most successful party in a long time.</p>
<p>Badiha looked back fondly at the night, it was literally the night that brought her off the streets. Connections were everything, and for the wealthy and well connected women of the Oxford Horse Riding Society, a non-threatening female dealer was the cornerstone of their social calendars. Soon Badiha found herself being brought along on holidays, meeting the high and mighty, even getting to attend a small party in the houses of parliament. Each time her network would expand so that even after she finished university, she had no doubt where her money was going to be coming from.</p>
<p>Badiha had stuck predominantly to female clients as she had no desire to deal with the testosterone and ego that swirled around male drug users. What initially began as self-preservation became a unique brand as she moved on to dropping off cocaine at the various white collar offices that her university friends began to build their careers in. Olivia moved on to being an accountant who organised a lot of Badiha's 'consultancy fees' so she could join her friends in purchasing the component parts of the high life beyond suspicion.</p>
<p>Badiha had received a strange call from an up-and-coming political operator called Monique, who'd landed herself a sweet position within the Conservative Party but Badiha knew her as the instigator of the naked shrooms incident during the Horse Riding Society's trip to the New Forest. She wanted to meet in person at a quiet restaurant and didn't need Badiha to bring any product with her.</p>
<p>"So I need your help with something." Monique splurged the moment the opening pleasantries were out of the way. "Do you know how to get ahold of prostitutes?" Badiha didn't, she had gotten a reputation as a problem solver during various parties and holidays, but those had all been the tradecraft of knowing when and how to avoid trouble. But she sensed this was not an insurmountable problem so she decided to roll with the moment.</p>
<p>"Yeah I know some people. Why do you want one?"</p>
<p>"It's not for me." Monique quickly explained. "One of the MPs is causing us some problems. She's a sexual harassment scandal waiting to happen and we figured if we could just get her laid it would give us time to prep damage control."</p>
<p>"Alright, so you don't just want a prostitute, you need a discrete man to chat her up."</p>
<p>"I know this isn't your usual, but I don't know how to..."</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I'll look into it."</p>
<p>Badiha finished her glass of wine in the house of commons bar and watched as her plan came to fruition. She had asked one of her suppliers if they knew any regular customers who engaged in sex work. She found a man that looked presentable despite his rampant coke habit, and managed to pay him off and threaten him in equal measure until she was sure he would do the job and keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>He walked out the door with Monique's problem MP and Badiha took a sneaky photo, to prove to Monique the job was done, and because it doesn't hurt to have that sort of information on a sitting MP. When Monique asked how much Badiha wanted for her services, Badiha decided the best price would simply be owing her a favour. Soon Badiha found herself a new role within high society, not only as a drug dealer, but as a discrete fixer that a well-to-do woman could trust.</p>
<p>Badiha was on a party boat floating in Poole harbour on the south coast of Britain. An incredibly wealthy and elderly couple were having an anniversary party at their mansion by the coast. Some friends of Badiha, aware that these sorts of parties fizzled quickly, decided an after-party on the high seas would be more fun than going home.</p>
<p>Badiha had made some arrangements to spice up the party, a drug selection catered to the people she knew would be there and some spares for any surprise guests. Similarly sex workers were also on standby and some rooms in the boat had been set aside for private messy fun. Everything else had been organised by a party organiser to be the decadent rave they were used to throwing.</p>
<p>The first wave of guests arriving at the jetty included Badiha's old friend Olivia, who had bridged the gap between Badiha and the group.</p>
<p>"I can't believe what you can pull off these days, how much do I owe you?" She asked as a lineup of scantily clad men started offering round trays full of drinks and narcotics.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, I'll put it down as owing me a favour." Badiha shrugged.</p>
<p>"Come on Badiha, you need to learn to charge for your services."</p>
<p>"You come from a world where this doesn't matter, but to me favours are the far more valuable thing to collect. The tax man can't investigate them, the police can't confiscate them, they cannot be scammed away or lost to a volatile market. You guys have a whole variety of safety nets and I have just the one, and I built it myself from favours."</p>
<p>"What do you mean 'you guys', you've been around us long enough, you're one of us now."</p>
<p>"My role in your group is to not be one of you. I started with dirty hands, and I continue to get my hands dirty, then one day when I need it, the gloves can come off." Olivia nervously shuffled at how intense the conversation had gotten. "Still let's not worry about that, I'd recommend some mandy to get you started, ket to take the edge off, then when you run out of energy have some NOS and watch the kaleidoscope inside your eyeballs."</p>
<p>"Ah the festival combo, good shout." Olivia agreed, going off to join the party as Badiha checked everyone was on board and cast off for the privacy of open waters.</p>
<p>A few hours in, one of the sex workers nervously approached Badiha as she networked, he had to drag her away as 'as issue had arisen.'</p>
<p>Badiha was shown towards the bar at the stern of the ship, where there was some nervous laughter flowing through the halls. When she arrived she saw what had caused the commotion, a small blonde woman was standing at the bar naked, recklessly throwing back shots of tequila. Badiha looked her up and down, recognising her as the daughter of the couple whose anniversary party was the warm up for this event.</p>
<p>"Hey there, it's Grace isn't it?" Badiha calmly approached the girl. "I don't think drinking that much that quickly is a good idea. You'll vomit and crash hard, I got some things that will take the edge off if you'd like."</p>
<p>"I'm not drinking it because I want to. I'm doing it because Carla over there ordered me to." She explained throwing back another shot and pointing to a woman contemptuously laughing at the situation. "I decided that since I'm such a fuckup, I'm not going to say no to anyone's orders tonight."</p>
<p>"I'm guessing someone else ordered you to remove your clothes."</p>
<p>"And throw them overboard. I am this party's bitch!" She chanted to nervous cheers.</p>
<p>"Fine, if that's the way you're operating. I order you to sit and have a casual drink with me." Badiha stated, grabbing Grace a strong energy drink to get her through this. "So why did you agree to this, is someone blackmailing you?"</p>
<p>"Nope, I'm just sick of constantly having to be assertive because my dad made a million bajillion pounds by yelling at underlings. All it means is everyone hates me and my career's a dead end. So this party is out at sea, no phone signal, I'm going to see what it's like to be the lowest of underlings." Bidiha sensed this was another moment she could utilise. She stared the girl in the eyes, partially to keep her attention and partially to ignore the degrading nudity the heiress was indulging.</p>
<p>"Do you know who I am?"</p>
<p>"You're the female fixer, everyone's heard of you. You make things happen."</p>
<p>"OK, so how about I make this happen for you? Doing these things spontaneously is always going to be disappointing. These people weren't prepared, they don't know what to do with you. You get the odd order here and there but it's not going to be the adventure you want, hell I'm fairly certain Carla just wanted you unconscious. So how about this; you go back to one of the rooms and I'll have the largest, roughest man tie you up and fuck you silly. Then when you come to, you'll have my number in your phone, and you can give me a call to plan something far more comprehensive for you." Badiha planned, mostly as a way to keep Grace from derailing the party but not ignoring the possibility of having another wealthy well connected woman owe her a favour.</p>
<p>"You'd do that for me?" Grace sobbed.</p>
<p>"Absolutely, let me plan something, then you'll owe me a favour OK?"</p>
<p>Badiha had to remind herself over and over again how wealthy and influential Grace's family were. She was used to purchasing sex workers and looking the other way but what Grace had called for was something else, something darker. Badiha had diligently done her research, she'd looked online and talked to prostitutes to put together a humiliation fantasy for Grace. She'd even dressed herself in an appropriate sexy latex outfit with supervillain makeup and high heels so she would be in keeping with the aesthetic as she oversaw the debauchery.</p>
<p>As she waited outside an abandoned warehouse she had been lent by someone she had helped out of a jam before, a van drove up to where she was standing. A man in a ski mask got out of the van and opened the back panel door where a woman had been tied up with a bag over her head. She was hoisted around out of the van, then the bag was ripped off and she was face to face with Badiha. Grace's face quickly went from fear to understanding to arousal, Badiha had secretly cleared her calendar and had not told her today was the day when her operatives jumped her in the parking garage of her home.</p>
<p>"The safe word is backgammon." She whispered into Grace's ear, backing away and giving her a grin. "Right, take her away." She ordered as two more men in ski masks appeared behind her.</p>
<p>Badiha stood in the corner and watched as the three male sex workers she had hired got to work fulfilling the brief she had given them. They began by standing Grace in the middle of the wide open warehouse and getting out some scissors to cut off her clothes, each time throwing the rags of former riches into a nearby fire in an old oil drum. Grace squealed and squirmed against her bonds as the men teased her and laughed at her predicament.</p>
<p>"Alright blondy, say goodbye to your former life. From now on you'll be selling your body for us. How does that sound?" One of the men announced with his hand firmly wrapped around Grace's neck.</p>
<p>"Hey boss, shouldn't we make sure the goods are solid before the clients get a turn? Posh bitch like this we need to know she can take a cock." The other replied.</p>
<p>"Good idea." He maliciously replied, slowly but relentlessly moving his hand down to her pussy. They had a gag planned for if she resisted, but Grace had spent the whole fantasy smiling like a loon, when the prostitute's hand made contact with her pussy her moans immediately echoed around the warehouse. "Looks like someone's a secret slut. How about it princess, are you looking forward to being our whore?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes." Grace enthusiastically replied. The man immediately gave her a heavy swat on her exposed bottom.</p>
<p>"You refer to me as 'sir', do you understand?"</p>
<p>"Yes sir." Grace replied, her smile never fading. She was not doing a good job of playing along with the kidnapping and rape fantasy but she didn't care.</p>
<p>"Very good, whore." The man chuckled, forcing Grace onto her knees and then undoing his trousers to liberate his hard cock right in front of her face. With her hands tied behind her back all Grace could do was nuzzle and kiss the cock before the man grabbed her head. "I want to hear you gag on my cock or I'm going to be very upset."</p>
<p>Badiha was surprised at how eagerly Grace was enjoying the fantasy as she began to blow the male prostitute. She figured it must be because Grace knew it couldn't actually be real. Grace barely knew Badiha, but if it turned out she couldn't be trusted and was legitimately trying to sell Grace into sex slavery, it wouldn't be long before her parents offered her kidnappers ten times her projected lifetime earnings to extract her from the situation. The gift of connections was that the fantasy was as dark and lasted as long as they chose. Even when a second male prostitute grew tired of mocking Grace's humiliating gagging and moved her onto a dirty mattress so he could take his place behind her to begin a complete debasement, at the end of the day Grace was still in control.</p>
<p>Badiha allowed her mind to wander about how she would handle such a situation, in her younger years she doubted the police would even bother to look for a missing drug dealer, she would be in Grace's position in earnest, being spitroasted by two men while a third told her to look forward to a lifetime of sexual slavery. Grace has no idea how hard Badiha had worked to have the safety net she was now relishing falling into, as she dwelt on this Badiha felt rage flash through her that pushes her forward.</p>
<p>"This country club girl clearly knows her way around a cock." She announced, moving one of her hired men out of the way. "Let's see that posh tongue deal with a poor Paki pussy."</p>
<p>Before she knew what was happening, Badiha had uncomfortably pushed the crotch on her latex outfit to one side and freed her vagina for Grace to begin enthusiastically lapping at while her pussy continued its relentless punishment and her recent partner in tonsil tickling began to lubricate himself ready to punish her anus.</p>
<p>"Yeah, get in there deep." Badiha moaned, pulling grace hard enough against her that she was practically suffocating. "You're going to be selling your rich bitch body for my payday for years to come, so you need to remember the juices of the woman who now owns your body." The prostitutes that Badiha had hired were a bit worried by their boss's sudden loss of composure, but the laughter and slurping coming from Grace calmed their fears somewhat. When Badiha heard a squeal of pain from Grace as a cock forced its way into her anus, she snapped out of her fury and backed away, leaving the men to take over.</p>
<p>She wanted to calm down, she wanted to be in control as the situation demanded, but Badiha couldn't concentrate. In the next room was the next stage of Grace's humiliation, a crate with lots of straps built into it so she could be transported across town like cargo, ready to be manhandled for a bit before being released.</p>
<p>Badiha leant against the box, she listened in to the sounds of violation coming from next door and, with a hand clamped over her mouth, she masturbated to finish herself off, hoping an orgasm would clear her head and keep her focused. Sexual lapses in judgement were for the Graces of the world, she couldn't afford them. Badiha climaxed as she heard Grace arrive at her screaming conclusion.</p>
<p>"Alright boys, you think we'll get a good price for her?" Badiha nonchalantly asked as she sauntered back into the room. Grace was a pile of quivering sticky joy as she was hoisted to her feet.</p>
<p>"Probably, but she's a rich cock holster, won't her family come looking for her?'' The man replied, keeping to Badiha's script.</p>
<p>"Good point, let's ship her abroad, make sure she's far from safety while we sell her ass." Badiha suggested, stepping to one side as her hired men moved Grace into the room to be strapped to the crate. She trusted the men to carry out her instructions so decided to leave early to get to the cargo ship to get ready for Grace's arrival.</p>
<p>Badiha's mind was swirling as she drove to the next location, she had completely lost her cool when faced with Grace's sexual decadence. Part of her wanted to bring Grace down to earth, maybe really sell her into sexual slavery and wait to savour the moment her face turns from that stupid grin to horrific realisation. Part of her wanted to be Grace, able to detach from the knowledge of what some people really go through long enough to find briefly living the lives of the downtrodden to be a fun holiday. In general she was a mixture of angry and horny, so she reached into her glove compartment and popped a Benzo just to calm her down and keep her emotions at bay as she made sure Grace's depraved fantasies at no point actually put her in any real danger.</p>
<p>Badiha was rigid as she returned home. Grace was unloaded from her crate to universal mistreatment and smiled her way through the whole experience. She was spanked and slapped and paraded around the crew of the ship, all intent on making her feel like her wellbeing was only there to be discarded in favour of their sexual ferver. But in the end she got to go home, actually she got to shower herself off, change, give Badiha a big hug while thanking her profusely, then go home.</p>
<p>Badiha knew people, she knew with a couple of phone calls she could have had Grace handcuffed to a bed and be collecting 20% on what some very nasty people would charge for her. She even wondered if she could have gotten away with it, if Grace turned her fortune against Badiha's connections after the inevitable kidnapping and rescue came to light. In the end she decided it wasn't fruitful to dwell on these sorts of things and went to bed.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>The next morning she woke up and checked her emails, the concept of a day off still not entirely embedded in Badiha's psyche, it was filled with the usual schemes and projects she had made herself a cog in to get money and favours, a few party "invites", which for Badiha meant someone wanted her make sure they didn't dirty their hands fixing whatever illegal elements they wanted. She also found an essay from Grace, expressing every depth of gratitude she could plumb for the experience Badiha had organised.</p>
<p>The next email after Grace's became another moment that defined Badiha's life. Despite everything Grace had chosen not to be subtle about the experience she had been through, and the person who had organised it for her. As Badiha now was staring at an email from one of Grace's private school friends, also asking for a curated sexual experience.</p>
<p>Dear Ms. Badiha Sehgal,</p>
<p>We haven't met but your reputation precedes you. I've heard you can fix it for girls with strange desires to have our fantasies come true and I'm in a position to pay whatever it costs for such a service.</p>
<p>As long as I can remember men have never treated me the way they treat my friends. I've never understood it, I am bustier than average and am not opposed to sexual experiences. Nonetheless nobody wants to be the one who crossed me in any way, including any perception of an unwanted advance, so while my friends are off having wild sexual experiences I'm often left behind. This has gotten even more acute since I became a junior partner at my mother's law firm.</p>
<p>I want one night where people are looking at me with lust. In short, I want to be a stripper. I want to perform at a strip club without any risk that it will affect my day to day life. Can you make this happen?</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Bella Maximus</p>
<p>On the one hand Badiha sighed, another wealthy woman who thinks it's scandalous to have a working class job. But when she researched Bella further the scale of the favour she would owe overwhelmed Badiha.</p>
<p>Badiha's rise to being a fixer (of sorts) was unusual, the average fixer would either be a lawyer willing to bend their career to a behind the scenes life of cleaning up messes, or a private school chum who doesn't mind being the name on a series shell companies set up to take the heat that would otherwise be taken by his friends. That being said, fixers didn't really compete as it was seen as mutually destructive, they always seemed to have a way of carving out networks to operate in. That's how Badiha knew about Clementine Maximus, a terrifying cleaner of corporate messes, senior partner of Maximus and Jones, and mother of a legal assistant/aspiring stripper.</p>
<p>Badiha stared at her computer, if she accepted this request, she knew it would cement a new reputation, the weird fetishes of the upper crust would become known as her stock and trade. She wasn't sure if that was the direction she wanted to go in, but being owed a favour by the daughter of a woman who had made war crimes disappear was one hell of a temptation.</p>
<p>At first she made some enquiries, just to gauge how easy it would be before she made a decision. Then she found herself getting carried away planning every twist and turn, enjoying the perverse ingenuity such a task requires. She pretty much had the whole experience planned when she gave in and emailed Bella with a time and place to meet.</p>
<p>When Badiha saw the woman waiting for her in the lobby of the Royal Thistle Hotel, she couldn't help but wonder if her problems were simply caused by the waves of intimidation she seemed to emit. She cut a stern presence as she stood tall and powerful, shooting various bellboys and valets contemptuous looks through her rectangle rimmed glasses. Her tied brown hair and power suit clearly signalling that her visit was a professional one, and her profession was far above you. The whole look also did a fine job obscuring her young age, Badiha had figured out she was at school with Grace, so probably only 23 or 24, but no girl so young would cause people to cower the way Bella did.</p>
<p>"Ah, Ms. Sehgal, thank you for taking the time to meet with me." Bella politely acknowledged, shaking Badiha's hand.</p>
<p>"Please call me Badiha, your proposal is mutually beneficial enough to be on a first name basis." Badiha replied, leading Bella to the hotel restaurant she had made arrangements with. The manager showed Badiha to a booth she was very happy to have found for this plan, out of the way of restaurant staff, customers and any CCTV systems, it always felt like a blind spot on the world.</p>
<p>"So can we talk candidly here?" Bella asked.</p>
<p>"Absolutely, it's the entire purpose of this table. Important people such as us reserve this table for sensitive discussions. It even has a standing arrangement with the staff that none of them will approach the table unless we call in an order from my phone."</p>
<p>"Great, I want to be a stripper, I want a room full of people looking at my sexy body, ogling me, treating me like a piece of meat. I want to finally see lust in people's eyes rather than fear." Bella splurged as Badiha sat back and relaxed.</p>
<p>"That's good, because that's what I have arranged to happen."</p>
<p>"What? When?"</p>
<p>"A couple of hours from now."</p>
<p>"Hang on, I thought we were just going to discuss details, you've already got it organised?" Bella squeaked in disbelief.</p>
<p>"Very much so. Did you wonder why I asked to meet at a hotel in Edinburgh when we are both based out of London. Another benefit of this place is that there are no cameras between this booth and the maintenance stairway over there. Furthermore, a very important man is having a meeting in a conference room, he's flying in by helicopter and flying out again tomorrow. I have made arrangements for us to borrow that helicopter on its outbound flight when everyone thinks it's just going back to the airport, to drop us off in Aberdeen. I have made arrangements with a strip club in that area to have you perform." Badiha calmly explained.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, and nobody will recognise me?"</p>
<p>"I scoped out this club carefully, even at the long odds of someone you know happening to be in Aberdeen, and happening to want to visit a strip club tonight, the reputation of this one would certainly put off someone from your circles, this place is a popular hangout for people who work on oil rigs, pretty rough. Although just in case I've asked security to keep out anyone who seems out of place." Badiha explained while the stern exterior of Bella melted into a blushing bashful woman, squirming with the sudden nervous realisation of what she wanted. "Should we head off then?"</p>
<p>Badiha had been surprised that Bella was capable of giggling, let alone how much of the journey she had spent doing just that. Their taxi from the heliport had snaked through the back streets of Aberdeen and stopped outside a service entrance with a black nondescript door. Badiha had organised that once she had talked to security, it would be an unobstructed walk from the back door to the changing room set aside for Bella.</p>
<p>Badiha had bought Bella's outfit, guessing her size based on photographs she had seen. So when Bella stepped out of the changing room, Badiha couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt at the tight and small police officer costume barely stretched over Bella's ample frame. Bella however loved the tightness of the clothes, the outfit of an authority figure undermined by its owner's body bursting out of it appealed to her. Her hair was still tied up in a professional bun hidden by the police hat, but her glasses had now been replaced with contact lenses to soften her look a little. She started walking towards the stage, surprisingly sturdy despite knee high leather boots with platform heels.</p>
<p>Bella stood to one side watching the previous act spin around a pole, Badiha had not anticipated this level of enthusiasm, Bella was not due to dance for another half an hour. Badiha spent the next five minutes hectically bribing the DJ and the other strippers to let Bella jump in the queue as Bella felt her pulse quickening at the sight of the stripper practicing her craft and the rush of truth that she would be doing similar next. Eventually as the woman collected up her clothes and left the stage, Bella heard the call from the DJ.</p>
<p>"Please welcome to the stage, Constable Cocktease!" He announced as Bella strutted out. As she reached the pole and looked out over the audience, the DJ played Fuck Tha Police by NWA and Bella began to dance and gyrate herself.</p>
<p>Badiha let the courteous smile fade from her lips as Bella's face fell to a rabid grin, her hands barely able to stop shaking long enough to unbutton the policewoman's dress revealing the skimpy underwear underneath. Bella was intoxicated by the cheers and catcalls of her adoring audience, freed from the crippling burdens of respect and fear.</p>
<p>Badiha decided to wander through the audience, she couldn't believe someone was so ready to give up an aura that protected her. She thought about the friends she had growing up that would have given anything to be feared and respected, to not be treated like a piece of meat. She thought about the number of times she was selling drugs and pervy men would ask if her body was also for sale. The very same sort of men who filled the bar to cheer as Bella released her heaving breasts from the skimpy bra she had been provided and shook her tits for the audience's approval.</p>
<p>Bella peeled off her sodden knickers and the men openly lusted over her, their arousal holding back their disbelief of a stripper with an unshaved bush gracing the stage. Her eyes darted along a succession of erections pushing up trousers and ravenously licked her lips as she threw her hat to one side and let down her hair. Tousling her hair and running her hands down her body, she was enjoying herself as only someone of privilege could.</p>
<p>'oh you like having an honest job do you?' Badiha thought to herself as Bella gyrated on stage, showing off every inch of her debased body. 'alright then, let's give you a full shift shall we?'</p>
<p>Badiha cast her eyes over the bar and spotted a large weathered man cheering boisterously for Bella. She wandered over to him and sat at his table.</p>
<p>"You like this one? How would you like a free private dance with her?" She sadistically asked. The man eagerly nodded and Badiha led him towards the private booths the club had for this purpose. "Wait here, she'll be with you shortly."</p>
<p>By the time Badiha returned to the club, Bella had finished her stage show and had retreated backstage. Badiha smirked as she made her own way to the dressing rooms to find Bella redressing in her original clothes.</p>
<p>"Oh Badiha, that was perfect. I'm so happy and horny right now." Bella splurged.</p>
<p>"Why are you putting your normal clothes on, you're not done yet." Badiha informed. Bella stopped and looked confused. "You said you wanted to be a stripper, well the stage show is just one part of that, you have a gentleman who has paid for a private dance waiting for you in booth 6."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, you mean I'd be up close and personal to a man? Dancing for his arousal?" Bella spluttered.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it would be suspicious if you stripped on stage but weren't available for private shows. So you have to keep going or people might suspect." Badiha lied, she didn't think anyone would suspect who Bella was any more than a German 8 year old would suspect if Buster Keaton started driving their school bus. Nonetheless Bella nodded and began to change back into her police outfit.</p>
<p>"You don't need the full costume, just the underwear, and if anyone pushes their luck with you call for a bouncer, you're just there to dance for them." Badiha quickly advised to assuage her guilt at putting Bella back out to work.</p>
<p>As Bella strutted to the private booths, Badiha rushed to the currently empty manager's office. With the amount she'd bribed him to make tonight happen she was pretty sure he wouldn't mind her watching the action on the CCTV monitors he thought he had kept hidden. Badiha made a note to delete the main stage footage when she was done but for now she settled for turning off recording and watching the show.</p>
<p>The man's face lit up as Bella entered the booth, he had been waiting for a bit longer than comfortable and had started to wonder if he had been tricked before Bella walked through the curtains. She began undulating in front of him, leaning over to whisper things in his ear before grinding herself on his lap. She straddled the man as she took off her bra, letting him lean forward and smother his face between her breasts. Badiha frowned, she was already playing fast and loose with the rules.</p>
<p>Bella stood up, keeping her back to him as she pulled her knickers down over her knee high boots, giving the man a good look between her legs. She stepped away, turned, and kneeled between his legs, mocking that she was giving him a blow job, her hand beginning to slide between her legs. Badiha's eyes bulged out of her sockets as she watched Bella sit back and begin masturbating for the benefit of this man. She held her lips apart as she started rabidly twitching her finger over her clitoris. The man reached down his trousers and began clearly jerking himself off, which only encouraged Bella more.</p>
<p>Bella was clearly orgasmically moaning at this point, Badiha hoped she could at least keep her voice down enough not to attract attention. She sprang to her feet and whispered into the man's ear, her hand never leaving her pussy. The man looked disbelievingly for a moment, but at Bella's insistence he began to squeeze Bella's breasts with the hand he wasn't using to jerk himself off with. His hands ran up and down Bella's body and in no time at all his hips bucked as he came in his pants. Bella didn't stop despite her client's completion, that a man wanked himself off at the sight of her naked body only spurred her on, she collapsed on the floor and screwed her eyes tight as she climaxed harder than she had ever done before.</p>
<p>Badiha watched as the man, sharing the booth with a distracted stripper, began to collect up her bra and knickers in preparation to leave. Badiha knew she should stop him, she knew if she did nothing Bella would have to walk back through the bar naked and the questions that would raise, but she did nothing. Her face curled into a grin at Bella being robbed of her clothes and facing the indignity of walking back through the club naked. Her mind wandered even further, what if she locked Bella out of the changing rooms? What if she left her naked and alone in the middle of Aberdeen? How violated would this privileged slut get if all connections to her old life were abruptly severed, leaving her as the degraded stripper she had asked to be. Badiha felt a tingle in her knickers just thinking about it.</p>
<p>Then she remembered her mother could have her disappear, never to be seen again and decided to delete some CCTV footage while letting Bella retreat back to the life of safety she was so determined to shirk.</p>
<p>"Woah, what a rush." Bella announced as she entered the changing room.</p>
<p>"Bella, what happened to your costume?" Badiha asked, enjoying watching Bella squirm at her lapse in judgement.</p>
<p>"I figured I'd walk back naked, you know for the thrill." She lied.</p>
<p>"Oh really?" Badiha replied. "In which case what kind of fixer would I be if I didn't help you with that. The bar closes in an hour, how about we get a drink?"</p>
<p>Badiha knew she was pushing her luck, but at that moment she had Bella's ego in the palm of her hand and she wanted to exploit it. Bella had degraded herself for everyone in the bar, but now this powerful woman was either going to admit she was out of her depth, or bend to the will of a drug dealer from Tower Hamlets. A girlish giggle escaped Bella's mouth and Badiha knew she had her.</p>
<p>"Sure." She replied, trying to hide her nerves. "I could go for a drink.</p>
<p>Badiha looped arms with Bella and they walked out to the bar together. The world seemed to stop and stare as Badiha took her prize to the bar and ordered a couple of cocktails.</p>
<p>"The other girls aren't going to like some tourist giving a free performance." the bartender warned as he passed two martini glasses towards the girls.</p>
<p>"Tell them if they don't complain there'll be a grand each in their tip jars at the end of the night." Badiha replied before turning back to her conquest, "you don't mind covering that do you?"</p>
<p>"Of course not." Bella replied, strangely unnerved that Badiha could be calmly discussing financial compensation with her while the whole club stared at her naked body.</p>
<p>Badiha stared at Bella, drinking in her humiliation, admiring her gambit of bringing low such a formidable woman who threw herself upon Badiha's trust. She couldn't tell if she was disappointed or relieved that Bella still seemed to be enjoying herself.</p>
<p>As they say at the bar drinking in the situation, a man walked next to them, he ordered a beer as he nonchalantly placed an arm around Bella's hips. Bella gasped with arousal, but Badiha decided this was a bad road to go down and that she needed to stamp her control on the situation. Summoning up all the intimidating presence she had previously witnessed from Bella, she stood up.</p>
<p>"Excuse, I'd thank you not to touch my property without my permission." Badiha announced to the club, peeling off the man's arm. The man was clearly angered by being called on this but Badiha didn't waver in her intimidating gaze. A more savvy client of the strip club moved into the situation.</p>
<p>"Please may I grope your property's tits?" He asked, de-escalating the situation to his advantage.</p>
<p>"Yes, you may." Badiha replied, not breaking eye contact with her quarry. "Sex object, present your tits to be groped by that man." Bella was startled by the order, but nevertheless obeyed, thrusting out her chest so the man could wrap his hands around her ample breasts. Her moans of delight mixing with Badiha's hard stare the soften the other man.</p>
<p>"Fine, please can I feel your property's ass?" He sighed. A smile crawled across Badiha's face and she nodded.</p>
<p>Soon Badiha found herself acting as gatekeeper to Bella's body as more and more men asked to squeeze, pinch, and spank Bella. The distraction to the club so severe that the other strippers had given up and retreated back to the changing rooms to be ready to go home as soon as Badiha finished up whatever she was doing and paid them.</p>
<p>"Hey, the women taking orders for the slut." A man yelled to get attention. "Could you get her on stage so we can all enjoy her?" Badiha felt it was a reasonable request and led Bella over to the stage, as she was walking over the bell for last orders was sounded and the club was aware their fun would soon be over.</p>
<p>"Alright, I wanna see this slut get fucked on stage." One guy yelled, but Badiha immediately turned the stink eye to him, Bella was there to show off, not to prostitute herself out. The club groaned as Badiha shook her head.</p>
<p>"What about you then?" Another man yelled.</p>
<p>"I'm not doing shit, this here's the show." Badiha fired back, shaking Bella's tits for emphasis. Bella giggled at her debasement, then quicker than Badiha could handle she spun around and pressed her lips tight to Badiha's face while the club cheered on the sudden expression of lesbian lust on stage.</p>
<p>Once she had finished kissing Badiha, Bella backed up with a smile on her face. Badiha looked around and suddenly figured out Bella's gambit, her perception to the crowd had just changed, she was now part of the show, Bella had just committed a coup on stage and Badiha had been reduced to a fellow performer.</p>
<p>"Looks like we're in this together now." Bella whispered mockingly in Badiha's ear. Badiha couldn't believe this, her self-imposed position above Bella was not just about self-gratification (although she was unwilling to admit it was a huge factor), she was also protecting Bella from the worst machinations of the gathered men by leveraging her status. Once again a woman from privilege was removing her safety nets just for the thrill of it, something Badiha found increasingly confounding.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"Off! Off! Off!" The crowd began to chant as Badiha fearfully tried to think of a way out of the predicament Bella had just bought down on them.</p>
<p>"You heard the customers." Bella giggled. "Come join me in the gutter."</p>
<p>Badiha had to admire Bella's ability to turn the tables. Badiha had been whipping the men into a fervour and relying on Bella to take the brunt of their lust. What's more she had been enjoying creating a risky situation, something she had previously scoffed at Grace and Bella for. She decided that if this was going to be her stock and trade, she would need to be smarter about it in the future, and for now she could treat tonight as a learning experience.</p>
<p>The club let out a cheer as Bella began to unzip the green cocktail dress the Badiha had chosen to wear, Badiha doing nothing to stop her besides rolling her eyes. When she felt the dress couldn't get any looser, she dropped her shoulders and let it fall to the floor.</p>
<p>Badiha found it curious how these men had reacted to her. If she had simply been another stripper she doubted her c-cups would gather more attention than Bella's giant breasts. She certainly would not have seen as much fuss with her choice of comfortable conservative underwear and thick tights that Bella was currently rolling down her leg. But by virtue of being the former person in charge of the situation, the club was loving watching her status drop in front of their eyes. As Bella unstrapped her shoes to remove them with her tights, leaving Badiha facing an audience only in her underwear, she realised how eager people were to see the mighty fallen, it was a sobering reminder of how precarious all their positions were.</p>
<p>Bella moved Badiha's long brown hair out of the way as she unclipped the bra strap. Badiha instinctively grabbed the cups of the bra to stop it falling. So Bella swung round and pressed her naked body against Badiha's, giving her another long sensuous kiss. Badiha melted a little beneath Bella's lips and the overwhelming sexuality of the situation, long enough to allow Bella to pull her bra straps down her arms, taking off her bra and holding it up in triumph for the club as the men cheered for Badiha's recently freed breasts.</p>
<p>Badiha's mouth let out a whimper that was lost to the roar of the crowd as Bella kneeled in front of her to deliver the final degradation, she hooked her fingers around Badiha's knickers and slowly peeled them down. Badiha shuddered with the knowledge that only five minutes ago she was the most powerful person in the room, and now she was just another naked stripper like Bella. She awkwardly stood, wondering what would happen next, she certainly wasn't going to dance or debase herself further like Bella was intent on doing, but there was an air of expectation that her simply getting naked could not be the whole performance.</p>
<p>Bella decided another kiss was in order now they were both naked, and this time Badiha leant into it, she let her tongue probe Bella's mouth, her hands wrapping themselves around Bella's, pulling their naked bodies together before reaching down to squeeze her bottom, even briefly pulling her cheeks apart for the benefit of the audience. Then as Bella pulled away looking deeply into Badiha's eyes, Badiha took one hand off her bottom, and with great ceremony placed it on top of her head. The crowd cheers as Bella was slowly pushed down until she was kneeling in front of Badiha's pussy.</p>
<p>Badiha had expected some hesitation but there was none, Bella immediately buried her face between Badiha's legs, her tongue probing as deep as it could. Badiha felt her knees go weak, then held Bella's face in place as she lowered herself onto the stage so she could lie down and swim in her public pleasuring.</p>
<p>Bella took the repositioning in her stead, adjusting so she was on all fours, her pussy facing the audience as she reached down to pleasure herself. Her mouth never left Badiha's pussy and so they both began to moan with delight. Badiha felt the frustration of the night acutely for the first time, her conflicts and sadism reconciling as a desire for release expertly serviced by Bella's tongue. Her legs tightened around Bella's head as a calming climax rolled over her body, she then pushed Bella away and lay on the cool hard illuminated floor.</p>
<p>Bella picked Badiha up so they could face the audience and take a bow, something Bella did with much aplomb while Badiha jerkily and stiltedly bent over and straightened up again. Then she looked around for their clothes.</p>
<p>The stage was clear.</p>
<p>The audience had seized on Badiha's distraction and stolen her clothes. She yelled at the audience to give them back but they were already filtering out of the club as it was closing time. Badiha was panicking, trying and think of a solution, when the bartender handed her the handbag she had left behind to parade Bella around the club.</p>
<p>"Figured you wouldn't get out of here alive if someone stole your purse and you weren't able to pay the performers the grand each that you said you would." He pointedly informed. It was clear that naked or not, they were making sure her priority was to pay the strippers so they could get out of here.</p>
<p>As she was paying each stripper, Badiha asked them all if they had any spare clothing. She begged and offered further money, and yet every stripper had decided to teach Badiha and Bella a lesson by playing dumb about any spare clothes anywhere on site. In the end it was just Badiha, Bella, and a bartender pressuring them to leave as he was eager to close up.</p>
<p>In the end Badiha sighed and called for a taxi, they would have to suffer the indignity of a taxi driver getting sight of them for a while journey, not to mention checking in to their hotel naked. Badiha then schemed if she woke up first thing she would get some looks but she could probably go to a clothes shop wearing a hotel dressing gown and be able to have them clothed again by the time they needed to be on a helicopter.</p>
<p>A night full of humiliations was only just beginning for Badiha, she saw the wide grin on Bella's face and admired that she was still enjoying herself in the face of what lay ahead. She remembered channelling Bella's intimidating attitude to great effect and wondered if the same could be done for her enjoyment at such degradation.</p>
<p>"Taxi's here." The bartender announced.</p>
<p>"Brilliant, are you ready my slutty accomplice?" Badiha replied, shocking Bella with her sudden change in attitude.</p>
<p>"Of course, let's go show more of this city our tits and pussies." Bella replied, hooking arms with Badiha as they strutted out of the door.</p>
<p>The next morning, once Bella had redressed she transformed back into the serious and intimidating presence she once was. She thanked Badiha in her formerly stern and businesslike way, as if Badiha had just finished her accounts. She asked Badiha how much she owed and Badiha repeated her usual schtick that she preferred to be rich in favours than in cash.</p>
<p>Badiha had just gained a very powerful contact.</p>
<p>Badiha did not think Bella would be indiscreet like Grace, but something had certainly shifted after Bella's performance, the following weekend she suddenly had a lot more emails waiting for her in her inbox, all of them requests for smutty fantasies from wealthy women. She could tell this was going to be her new bread and butter, but couldn't help but feel this was a positive development. A drug dealer asking for a favour could get turned down, but a fixer who had fulfilled such personal requests was far more difficult to ignore for the upper crust. In this moment, Badiha was amassing power faster than ever before.</p>
<p>Alright commenters, here comes the audience participation. Leave a comment below in the form of an email request from someone wealthy/well connected. Badiha will respond to the first 15 commented emails. (For the sake of fairness one email per person).</p>
<p>Please don't submit emails from characters already named, I got the meta plot figured out for them, instead get creative and invent your own original character and drive.</p>
<p>Like with Vicious Rumours, a response does not mean action, Badiha will not do all 15 of the contacts but she will acknowledge them and maybe even call back to them at a later date.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing what you got.</p>


<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>There were a lot of emails and they were long, so I'm not reproducing them here. If you want to know what emails Badiha received look in the comments section under part one.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who worked hard on their emails. It would have taken a novel the size of a brick to do them all justice so please don't feel disheartened if your comment only gets throwaway reasons not to be indulged. I was working on which fit the larger plot I had planned rather than any analysis of how good each prompt was (I had to turn down some good ones just because they didn't fit the theme I was going for).</p>
<p>There is going to be a part 3 so if you email hasn't been mentioned yet its coming up.</p>
<p>"Fucking hell." Badiha mumbled as she read over her emails. "Second generation rich people are fucking nuts."</p>
<p>She couldn't believe how self-destructive these women were, so many wanted to be blackmailed, deluded by horniness into imagining that anyone was powerful enough to put an end date on blackmail once the material was out there. The most insane were the ones who thought that Badiha would be eager to join them in throwing away their cushy lives for the sake of a fleeting thrill, although she had to wonder whether that came from some weird belief that all women have as fucked up fantasies as them, or if Bella had embellished details on the story of their naked night in Aberdeen.</p>
<p>Badiha started reading a fascinating email from a 19 year old billionaire who wanted to become the possession of her poor Hispanic roommate. She was drafting a nuanced reply that not only would extrication from such a situation be impossible once the novelty inevitably wore off, but also that a favour from the pet of someone who doesn't play rich people's games would be worthless regardless of how rich the individual was. She was finishing up her reply, secretly hoping that the roommate's dominance was inevitable without her help, when there was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>The man Badiha was staring at on her doorstep was big. He wasn't big in the way a man was big, he was big in the way a shaved bear in an expensive suit was big. He was big in a way that needed planning permission to stay still for too long.</p>
<p>"Miss Sehgal, please gather your laptop and come with me." He said in the uniquely calm voice used only by professionals well practiced at spontaneous disciplined violence.</p>
<p>"And if I refuse?" Badiha replied, surprised at her own defiance.</p>
<p>"I have been asked not to harm you." He stated, not a direct answer to Badiha's question but a very clear message nonetheless. She sighed and fetched her computer, with the man staying in her doorway she was able to start her phone recording ambient audio and GPS data that would be automatically attached to an email to Bella if she didn't return.</p>
<p>There were two more suited men waiting for her in the expensive black car idling outside her house. Badiha was in no doubt this was a show of force and opted to stay silent as they drove her through the streets of London. They stopped at the base of The Shard, parking in the underground car park where Badiha knew a regular parking space cost more than most people spend on their houses.</p>
<p>Badiha was brought to the lift that rode upwards for a long time before opening into an opulent modern office and living space, currently empty save for Clementine Maximus who was currently waiting for an expensive coffee machine to finish her expresso.</p>
<p>"Badiha, care for a drink?" All memories of Bella's intimidating front suddenly were brought into stark contrast, Bella had seemed like someone in total dominating control, but with her mother stood before Badiha, she could see Bella was a pale imitation of what she now saw. So far all Clementine had done was offer her a drink but Badiha still found her look cowering.</p>
<p>"No thank you." Bella politely replied. "I'd rather just know why you wanted me here."</p>
<p>"My men were not rough or rude with you were they?" Clementine replied, cementing that Badiha's opinions would only be addressed if they were first sought.</p>
<p>"He was as polite as he needed to be." Badiha replied. A wicked smile crawled onto Clementine's face.</p>
<p>"Wonderful, that is exactly the sort of answer I would want to that question. In fact it's not too far from his job description." She turned to her besuited ogre and shot him a single look that unmistakably carried the message 'good job, now fuck off.'</p>
<p>Clementine calmly took a sip from her expresso while her muscle stepped back into the lift and left her alone with Badiha. The moment the lift doors closed, Clementine took a thumb drive out of her pocket and tossed it to Badiha.</p>
<p>"Plug this into your computer and install the application on it." She ordered.</p>
<p>"Putting a leash on me in advance?" Badiha replied, sitting down on the sofa and placing her laptop on the table. Clementine rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"That thumb drive contains the same security software I have on all my business computers. It'll make sure I am the only person who gets to hack your computer and find out the nature of the services you provided my daughter." Clementine replied, her anger barely contained behind her facade of controlled dominance.</p>
<p>"How do I know it's not spyware?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"You seemed smarter in your emails." Clementine insulted, once again not answering Badiha's questions directly. "I'm already in your computer, I don't need to ask you to install spyware from a thumb drive."</p>
<p>"There are lots of different ways you could have found out about my work with Bella. If you didn't have access to my computer it would give you motive to gain that access." Badiha explained as Clementine's disappointment slowly washed off her face.</p>
<p>"Alright, you're not an idiot. That's good, idiots are unpredictable. In a way you are right, I found out about your jaunt with my daughter thanks to an overlapping asset. The helicopter pilot and I have an arrangement where I am privy to conversations held in his conveyance. Imagine my surprise when as an intermission to the business talks that have gained my attention, I hear my daughter discussing a trip to an Aberdeen strip club." Clementine casually walked over to her computer and opened it to face Badiha. On her screen was all the perverted emails that Badiha had recently received.</p>
<p>"It was after that I hacked your computer, and if I'm being honest I will still have access once you use that thumb drive. The difference is that nobody else will. Now I don't care about the herculean task of finding 5 doms to satisfy Judge Mary's lust. Although as a professional courtesy I would advise you that the more people involved the more difficulty you'll have controlling the situation."</p>
<p>"Of course. I was going to turn her down for the moment, I could hire some sex workers with a good reputation, but reputation isn't trust." Badiha explained, finding herself getting more relaxed with the convivial atmosphere Clementine was allowing to occur.</p>
<p>"Knowing who you can trust is a vital skill in our profession. Which brings me to the crux of this visit. What is the favour you want from my daughter and can I provide it for you now?" Clementine asked, placing her cup to one side and folding her arms beneath her impressive bust.</p>
<p>"If I had a favour in mind I would have used it already."</p>
<p>"If I didn't cancel that automatic email you queued up you could have called it in today by accident. I'm assuming your arrangement with Bella was partly to get to me and I don't want this hanging over her. So I want to know what it will take to delete whatever footage or material you have on her." Clementine explained. Badiha's face turned to confusion that Clementine picked up on immediately. "You don't have any evidence do you?"</p>
<p>"No, the point of my service is that there is no evidence." Badiha replied, as Clementine began to chuckle.</p>
<p>"And you were doing so well, I was actually impressed at your intelligence. But you're working for favours without any way to enforce them?" Clementine sniggered.</p>
<p>"Gather enough and..."</p>
<p>"You'll have enough people threatened by you to take action. Jesus Christ girl, even the interns in my shell companies' shell companies know 'favour' is just a polite way of saying blackmail. You genuinely think when the chips are down these people will act with honour?" Clementine snarled with frustration, Badiha actually found herself cowering, hoping to hide in the folds of the expensive sofa.</p>
<p>"I'm currently catching more flies with honey." Badiha stammered.</p>
<p>"I genuinely believe that vacuous saying was invented by someone in power trying to use civility to prevent anyone else getting as powerful as them, having a monopoly on malice is practically the definition of government. At the very least it was invented by someone who isn't around vinegar that often, flies actually love it, far more than honey in fact."</p>
<p>"With that in mind, why are you giving me the life lessons?"</p>
<p>"Let's call it a mixture of a mutually beneficial arrangement and fulfilling the favour Bella owes you." Clementine explained, casually sitting next to Badiha and plugging the thumb drive into Badiha's computer herself without waiting for permission. "I'm going to be in your emails anyway, it's only fair we coordinate. You keep delivering, the emails keep coming in, and I keep the information and advice flowing, think of it like a big old game of good fixer, bad fixer."</p>
<p>"And how do I know you won't turn on me the moment it is profitable for you?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"Young lady, I will 100% turn on you when it is in my interest to do so, but you've hit upon a service nobody will contact me to deliver, so it's going to be profitable for you to keep operating. Think of it as becoming a franchise of mine, protected and trained, and all I ask in return is something I already have, access to the intimate details of your clients." Right on cue Badiha's computer made a notification sound to confirm that Clementine's security software had been installed.</p>
<p>"Well, if I have no choice in the matter I might as well embrace it. I look forward to working with you. And if you ever find yourself wanting to utilise my services..." Badiha began as she walked towards the lifts.</p>
<p>"...My personal sexual outlets have been securely established and don't need outside intervention." Clementine interrupted. "But I certainly think it would be worth your while to follow up with Aimee Dobson."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"For now let's say I have a hunch." Clementine cryptically replied as the lift doors closed and Badiha was spirited away from her new benefactor.</p>
<p>Badiha had been already considering Aimee before Clementine had advised her to take on her challenge, if anything Clementine's stamp of approval was more likely to make her drop the matter than take it on. Her dad was pretty influential in the Conservative government, an former minister now referred to as an "elder" of the party by the media to reflect a soft power far outstretching his backbench status. Just the sort of person Clementine would like to have in her pocket.</p>
<p>Nevertheless she decided that it seemed like a simple task with a powerful pay off at the end. All she had to do was get some photos of Aimee doing all the humiliating things she claims to do anyway, then put together a nice sadistic game of chance with the grand prize being the release of the photos. This was going to be easy.</p>
<p>"Urgh." Badiha sighed to herself. It was day three of her stakeout of the life of Aimee Dobson and she couldn't believe she thought this would be easy. "I'm sure Clementine has a trusted PI for this shit, but I'm on my own here and I'm running out of bottles to piss in."</p>
<p>Badiha had been finding ways to tail Aimee and so far the results had been middling. At the gym she noticed Aimee spent more time than was normal naked around the changing rooms, but hadn't been able to get any pictures. (She couldn't exactly stand by the lockers with her camera out.) The email had mentioned masturbating by an open window, but each night Badiha had spent camped out in her car all she had seen was humdrum stuff.</p>
<p>Suddenly Badiha straightened up. Aimee had just gotten out of the shower and was parading around her lounge in nothing but a towel around her petit body, and another wrapped around her blonde mid length hair. With a slightly lopsided smirk that reminded Badiha of a cartoon character, she began to look out of the window, studying the street in anticipation.</p>
<p>"Fucking finally." Badiha said to herself, getting out her camera while shuffling lower into her seat. Aimee was checking her road, looking out into the midnight darkness to make sure nobody was watching. She let out a chuckle as she tucked her hand under where the towel had been tucked into itself to keep her makeshift dress covering her body and began to guide it on its path to unraveling.</p>
<p>Suddenly flashing blue lights turned the corner as an ambulance turned onto Aimee's road.</p>
<p>"Fuck off." Badiha growled as the ambulance weaved its way among the parked cars.</p>
<p>"Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off."</p>
<p>Finally the ambulance parked itself three doors down from Aimee's house and began attending to a panicked family, whose neighbours quickly joined them to offer their support as Aimee quickly closed the curtains.</p>
<p>"God motherfucking dammit." Badiha screamed. She took a deep breath and felt a steely determination well up inside of her. "Fuck this, time to take charge."</p>
<p>Aimee couldn't believe the stressful day she was having. Her boss had demanded she come into the office that day as one of their more lucrative clients had asked for her personally. So she woke up extra early, labouriously covered herself in makeup and professional clothes, crammed herself on the London underground, and then ran from the station to only just make it on time to her office. Once above ground and not running for the sake of punctuality, Aimee had time to listen to her answerphone messages and find out that not only had the client cancelled the meeting at the last minute, but the power had been cut to the whole office so everyone but her had been told to stay home.</p>
<p>Aimee looked her stuffy office building up and down and swore loudly, ignoring the strange looks she was getting from the street. Her frustration was tangible, for some time she hadn't even been able to indulge her favourite night-time activity without some crazy coincidence scaring her off. First there was the ambulance, then all those car alarms going off, then the fire alarm going off in the apartment block across the road so everyone was evacuated into the street. She just couldn't get a break, nobody in her circles wanted to sleep with the MPs daughter, even that fixer Grace had recommended seemed to have ghosted her.</p>
<p>As she looked at her office building, thinking about how it was going to be empty all day, the power cut so not even the CCTV cameras would be turned on, she had a mischievous idea, one that would certainly deal with the itch she had been desperate to scratch.</p>
<p>Aimee wasn't really close to Grace, just in similar circles, she had also never pegged Grace for a cinema goer. So she was quite surprised at the invite that came out of the blue to see some new blockbuster. Nonetheless she was happy to have the night off and didn't even blink an eyelid when she got a text from Grace:</p>
<p>'Running late, attached the ticket so you can go ahead and grab us a seat.'</p>
<p>Aimee sat down in the silent cinema. It was eerie, she didn't think she had arrived that early but at that moment in time she was the only one there. She looked around taking in the rows and rows of empty seats as the lights dimmed and the projector started up.</p>
<p>Aimee's eyes bulged in horror at what started playing on the screen, it was footage from her office CCTV of her sat at her desk, humming a happy tune to herself as she began to strip off her clothes. Her on screen persona laughed as she placed her work clothes in a neat pile, then stood on top of her desk and yelled to the empty office "I am Aimee Dobson, and today I am the office's humiliation slut!"</p>
<p>As she jumped down from her desk and began to look around for ideas, the video began a series of dynamic cuts over quirky music, like it had been made into a trailer for a Hollywood movie.</p>
<p>It cut to her in her boss's office, rubbing her exposed pussy on his mouse, then to her coming out of the men's toilets, her fingers furiously wiggling against her clit. The music dimmed for a moment so she could hear the presentation she had given her imaginary coworkers in the fancy meeting room.</p>
<p>"So today we're going to do a brainstorming session." She announced, walking over to the flip chart and picking up a colourful marker. "I want to hear from each and every one of you, a reason I am a slut." As she announced this, she misdirected that she was about to write on the flip chart, only to write 'reasons I am a slut' as a header across her chest.</p>
<p>The quirky music undimmed with the next shot of her walking out of the meeting room, covered in the imagined slurs and insults of her co-workers that she had written in big letters with brightly coloured pens.</p>
<p>Cut to the next shot of the CCTV camera panning over the empty employee lunch room, until Aimee enters the shot on all fours eating her lunch out of a bowl on the floor.</p>
<p>The next scene was once again back in the open plan office, with Aimee once again stood on top of her desk. The music cutting out humourously as Aimee yells to her imaginary co-workers.</p>
<p>"Does anyone want to come to my desk and spank me until you feel better about your life?" The footage then cut to Aimee bending over a chair and spanking her rapidly reddening bottom. "Yes, harder. I'm the office bitch. Punish me for everything wrong around here. Make my ass raw."</p>
<p>"Coming soon to a screen near you," Badiha's voice interrupted in her smoothest voiceover accent. "The destruction of Aimee Dobson. Featuring her entire morning being a humiliation slut, plenty of saucy details, and even bloopers."</p>
<p>The video cut to Aimee taking a bulldog clip out of a desk and putting it on her nipple, before yelping in the realisation that it was too tight and quickly removing it and awkwardly placing it back into the drawer.</p>
<p>"How many people are going to see this movie? Well I guess that depends on Aimee."</p>
<p>The house lights turned back on and Aimee was sat completely still, mouth agape in shock. Badiha emerged from the projection room and slowly walked towards her.</p>
<p>"Who are you? Why are you doing this?" Aimee squeaked, not even turning around to acknowledge the footsteps behind her. Badiha got really close, close enough so her lips were touching Aimee's ear.</p>
<p>"I'm doing this, because you asked me to." Badiha whispered. It took Aimee a moment but eventually it clicked who she was talking to.</p>
<p>"Badiha? Does this mean that video may get released?" Aimee asked, her voice quivering with the memory of what she had asked for.</p>
<p>"It's a possibility, but we'll come to that in a moment, but before we start just be aware the safe word is elderflowers." Aimee nodded in agreement as Badiha pressed a remote control and a table appeared on the screen. The table listed the following options, each with a slot to measure their score from 1 to 6:</p>
<p>The sold out cinema</p>
<p>The porn site</p>
<p>Conservative party HQ</p>
<p>Labour party HQ</p>
<p>Your friends</p>
<p>Currently every option had a 6 next to it.</p>
<p>"So let me explain, those 5 categories are the 5 groups of people who will be sent a movie at the end of our game. But you have a small amount of say in which movie is sent, every point you earn lets you roll a dice against one of the audiences, if the dice roll is lower than their current score it will become the new score. At the end, the audience will be sent the video that corresponds with that score." Badiha explained, pressing a button to bring up a list of what each score meant.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>6: the full movie with your name and details scrolling along the bottom.</p>
<p>5: the full movie</p>
<p>4: the trailer</p>
<p>3: the movie, but with your face blurred and your name beeped.</p>
<p>2: the trailer with your face blurred and name beeped.</p>
<p>1: nothing.</p>
<p>"Alright, so how do I earn points?" Aimee asked, starting to enjoy herself as the plans were laid out in front of her.</p>
<p>"Take these." Badiha ordered, handing Aimee a large ink pad. "This cinema is going to start filling up in an hour, so you are to be back here in half an hour with as many handprints on your naked body as possible. No one person can give you more than one handprint. Each hand print will give you one dice roll."</p>
<p>Aimee thought for a moment, before stripping off her clothes right there and then, shooting Badiha her trademark cheeky lopsided grin as she casually tossed her clothes to one side and shivered at her sudden nudity.</p>
<p>"A strong strategy." Badiha acknowledged, "just bear in mind that if you get arrested or kidnapped, you won't be back here in half an hour's time, so you may not want to be too brazen because I will send out those videos if you flake on me."</p>
<p>Aimee gripped her thighs to calm her shaking hands before slowly plodding out of room, Badiha opted to sit back and have a moment to relax.</p>
<p>Badiha was keeping a close eye on her phone, she didn't want to totally ruin Aimee, but she also felt it was important to be a woman of her word, and her word was the worst video would be sent to everyone if Aimee wasn't back in a minute. The sound of the door opening and heavy breathing relaxed Badiha, as did the sight of Aimee with plenty of handprints on her naked body.</p>
<p>"Alright, who gave you those handprints?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"Well this first one on my left tit is from the security guard, he was very helpful in exchange for a quick blow job. He showed me which staff would be cool and which would call the police on me, so I got this one on my right tit from the guy at the concessions stand, this one on my left butt cheek from the cleaner, and this one on my right butt cheek from the guy who checks the tickets. Once I had those he told me about some homeless men who hang out by the vents out back to keep warm, that's where I got this one over my pussy, these two on my thighs, and this one on my face."</p>
<p>"Sounds like you had quite an adventure, so now you get 8 dice rolls." Badiha informed, "So which one do you want the first dice roll on?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to start with the Labour Party HQ, they could make my dad's life hell if they get dirt on him."</p>
<p>"Very well." Badiha replied, pressing some</p>
<p>buttons on her phone. "Done, who's next?"</p>
<p>"What did I roll?" Aimee asked.</p>
<p>"Oh I'm not going to tell you. If you knew it wouldn't be as exciting." Badiha explained with a sadistic grin. "So the video may have gotten better, or you may have just rolled a 6 and nothing changed. Doesn't it make it more exciting not knowing?"</p>
<p>"What a good idea." Aimee agreed, sitting down and beginning to play with her pussy. "You don't mind if I begin to play with myself?"</p>
<p>"Not at all, I understand that is the point of this whole endeavour." Badiha replied, "but keep telling me which dice to roll.</p>
<p>"Alright I have 7 left, if I do one on each then I can choose 3 to roll again on. So roll once for all of them, then roll twice on the Labour Party HQ, my friends, and the porn site."</p>
<p>"Alright, while I do that, tell me why."</p>
<p>"I figured they were the most likely to ruin my life, the Labour Party hate my dad and would love to take him down, I don't know which of my friends you were planning to send it to but there are some I know would turn on me given the chance, and the porn site would spread like wildfire."</p>
<p>"Nice to see you've been envisioning your downfall." Badiha acknowledged, performing the secret dice rolls on her phone and making the necessary arrangements. "Right, want to find out how you did?"</p>
<p>"Oh god yes!" Aimee exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Well then, first things first, put on this coat, I want you to be sat in the middle of your audience when you find out what movie is on. You will take it off when the house lights dim but for now I want people to be surprised." Badiha handed Aimee a large brown coat and she squirmed with anticipation as the movie theatre began to fill up.</p>
<p>By the time the house lights dimmed, the cinema was full, Badiha had actually been surprisingly honest with how she got the audience, she had posted on a message board that she was doing a social experiment, everyone could have free tickets to a movie that would either be an action movie or porn. She had embellished the academic side a little, claiming this was a randomised study by the University of Hull, but nonetheless nobody in attendance was going to be surprised.</p>
<p>"Last chance to say the safe word." Badiha whispered into Aimee's ear, her response was simply a coat being thrust into her lap.</p>
<p>The screen sprung to life and Aimee immediately noticed that there were no scrolling details at the bottom. It was the camera above her desk, currently showing an empty office. This was an establishing shot, not featured in the trailer, Aimee started pleasuring herself again, it was definitely the full movie.</p>
<p>Aimee walked onto the screen and began to strip down, but the angle of the CCTV camera made face blurring unnecessary, so Aimee had to sit in wonder about which version it was, until she saw her naked form climbing onto her desk, the camera angle changed and soon she was looking at her unblurred face.</p>
<p>"I am Aimee Dobson, and today I am the office's humiliation slut." Her onscreen persona yelled. Aimee moaned with mortified arousal as the audience began to watch her full degrading adventures onscreen. Badiha simply hoped that a daughter of a backbench MP would be obscure enough that nobody would really recognise her.</p>
<p>Just after Aimee had finished watching herself rub her pussy against her boss's mouse, pleasuring herself furiously as the audience gasped and laughed at her humiliation, Badiha leaned in to show Aimee her phone.</p>
<p>"There's a bit of a lull in the action here, so how about I show you what I'm doing with a couple other videos." Badiha brought up a porn site on her phone and clicked on the button to upload a video. Aimee squirmed with trepidation as Badiha hovered her thumb over the 5 different movies in her folder, before clicking on the one labelled '2:trailer-identity blurred'.</p>
<p>Even though her identity was being preserved, Aimee still worried this would expose her, what if someone who recognised her office, or her voice, somehow managed to click onto the video. Nevertheless she made a note of the video name so she could revisit later and use the view count to see how many people had watched her desecrated body get paraded around her office.</p>
<p>On the big screen Aimee had just left the toilets and was heading towards the meeting room as Badiha held out her phone, this time showing Aimee an email she had composed to the general mailbox of her father's political party. She clicked the option to attach a file and once again the various video options came up. She hesitated just long enough for Aimee to enjoy the suspense, before selecting '5:full video-no identity blurring'.</p>
<p>Aimee clamped her hand over her mouth to swallow her gasp, but her hand did not leave her pussy. As the video attached to the email, Badiha was happy that the Aimee on the cinema screen was loudly brainstorming horrible things to write on her body, drowning out the growls of humiliation from Aimee masturbating in the cinema seat as Badiha pressed send.</p>
<p>All of a sudden Aimee lunged out of her seat and pressed her face against Badiha's. Badiha was shocked but eventually deigned to open her mouth and let Aimee's wild passion overflow onto her. She still didn't understand the appeal of this exposure, of enjoying the act of humiliation and weakening of your power. This girl had been handed a golden ticket just by being born to the right father and now she was biting that hand.</p>
<p>Badiha realised that she had made a lot of assumptions about the people she was dealing with, but one that was most striking was that she assumed Aimee's father would stand by her, not disown a humiliation junkie who was threatening to bring him down with her. She started to wonder if she should have only pretended to send the email, maybe rigged the dice rolls to bring out a desirable outcome, or at least vetted the cinema audience to make sure nobody was going to cause trouble.</p>
<p>As Aimee finished her wild kiss, Badiha saw her cheeky smile turn rabid and had a familiar flush of anger. Aimee didn't care, her wellbeing, her safety, these had always been somebody else's problem and she got to sail through life thinking everything will be fine because everything has always worked out for her in the end. Badiha wanted nothing more than to ruin her, to teach her a lesson about how flimsy her safety net of assumptions was. The only thing stopping her was that she doubted a favour from Aimee or her father would be worth much after such an action.</p>
<p>"So that's how you want to do it then?" Badiha whispered to Aimee, satisfying her anger through the dominance she possessed at that moment. She shuffled her trousers and knickers down her legs, then pushed Aimee down so she would be kneeling beneath the cinema seats and between her legs.</p>
<p>Aimee immediately took to her task, burying her face between Badiha's thighs and not holding back. Fortuitously as she started to do so, the cinema speakers blurted out Aimee in her fictional meeting admitting "yes I do look stuck up don't I, like I need to be taken down a peg. I'm going to write 'stuck up bitch' right here." Aimee remembered writing 'stuck up bitch' on her torso and swum in the memory, the realisation that a room full of strangers was watching her do it, and the feeling of being tongue deep in her tormentor as all of this was occurring.</p>
<p>As Aimee was eating her out, Badiha had lost the ability to whisper in her ear as she would like, so instead she typed out the next message on her phone. It read:</p>
<p>'As for the Labour party. They will not be receiving any video. Fun fact, you rolled a 1 on the first dice roll so the second one was actually wasted.'</p>
<p>"Dumb? Yes I suppose I am a bit of a stupid bimbo, that's mainly because I'm usually only thinking with my cunt." Onscreen Aimee announced as she wrote 'only thinks with this' on her pubis with an arrow pointing at her pussy. Badiha was really starting to enjoy the power of having Aimee between her legs and arched her back into the sensations.</p>
<p>Badiha felt like she was losing herself to the pleasure of the moment and decided to regain her control by grabbing Aimee's hair and pulling her off her vagina so she could show her the last step on her phone.</p>
<p>Aimee hadn't realised that when she had stripped to go collect handprints, she had left her phone behind. Badiha had been spying on her long enough to know what the password to her phone was, and had used the time to set up a WhatsApp group with all her phone contacts and an anonymous phone in Badiha's possession. Aimee wordlessly watched as Badiha showed her the list of names in the WhatsApp group. Her eyes then went wide as Badiha pressed the attach button, once again bringing up the familiar list of videos.</p>
<p>She selected '3: full video-identity blurred'.</p>
<p>Aimee's mind was racing, sure her identity was blurred but there were others from her work in that group that would recognise her desk, there were former lovers who would certainly know what her body looked like. Yes the identity was blurred but this was the one that would still definitely ruin her.</p>
<p>"Elderflowers." Aimee gasped, taking Badiha by surprise. It was the first bit of self preservation she had seen from a woman she was helping in this way. She had half a mind to send it anyway to make a point but instead she removed the attachment and closed her phone. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry." She started blubbing to Badiha, who allowed herself to feel pity for a moment.</p>
<p>"Do you want to stop everything or was it just that message?"</p>
<p>"I know I said I wanted you to ruin my life, to expose me to everyone, but I can't do it." She sobbed.</p>
<p>"There, there. We don't have to go further than you want." Badiha explained, before having a flash of inspiration. "But I don't think you should be without consequence. Everyone in this audience already knows you're a slut. Hell they're currently watching you write 'cum guzzler' across your tits. How about I tell you that the price of not following through on that last email is that you have to walk the aisles offering the audience the same service you just gave me?"</p>
<p>Aimee gave a big sob, then after a moment that same lopsided cheeky grin crawled onto her face as she stood up and began quietly asking the men and women of the audience if they wanted to put her mouth to good use.</p>
<p>Badiha relaxed and enjoyed the rest of the movie, wishing she had bought some popcorn.</p>
<p>Aimee had not stopped offering her body to the audience even after the movie had finished and the house lights had been turned up so everyone could see her. It took some time but eventually everyone who wanted to take Aimee up on her offer had done so and she returned to Badiha sticky and smiling.</p>
<p>Badiha handed her her clothes and some wet wipes, helping her once again become a respectable member of high society, the kind who could offer a favour worthy of the trouble Badiha had just been through.</p>
<p>Badiha sighed as she went through her emails, she was still trying to establish some sort of standard in her own mind to vet the requests she was getting. She knew she was capable of putting together most of the things that were being requested, but she was only one woman and so had to nitpick lest her applicants think she had rudely ghosted them.</p>
<p>It was especially awkward when one client actually sent her money ahead of an expected task. Badiha had to admit, to herself and the client, that she wasn't interested in being a direct dominatrix, she was just there to make arrangements. She recommended a fetish club she had heard about that would be filled with individuals better catered to Erica's needs before returning the money.</p>
<p>She then opened up an email and addressed it to herself, but with the subject 'Message for Clementine'. It read 'don't suppose you want to help me vet these clients?'</p>
<p>Badiha then turned her attention to Emily Foster's request to turn ascendency to the role of managing director of a large firm into some kind of Slut Games™. Badiha was sure someone like Clementine would be fine holding onto the vile video they described and not even bat an eyelid at having made an enemy in the course of her duties. But Badiha was still trying to be a different kind of fixer to her and didn't want all that negativity swirling around her business.</p>
<p>She was half way through drafting an email to that effect when she got an email from Clementine, no subject line, body text simply read 'no.'</p>
<p>Badiha's continued spree of regretful declinations was interrupted by a phone call from a blocked number. Badiha had many parts of her job that she hated, but the constant need of people to block their numbers when getting in touch with her was certainly high on the list.</p>
<p>"Nobody else has to deal with scams just in case they're customers." She sighed to herself as she picked up her phone. "Hello."</p>
<p>"Hello, is this Badiha Singh?" A woman with a hint of an accent asked.</p>
<p>"Depends on who's asking." Badiha bluntly responded.</p>
<p>"So my name is Nicole, you might remember me from my email request..." She began.</p>
<p>"Sorry for the delayed response, I get a lot of emails and I promise I will give yours due consideration when I get to it." Badiha sighed, trying to fob off any attempts to follow-up emails to hurry her along.</p>
<p>"Oh that's not why I'm calling. My dad is Sir Harold Quinn, he's basically in charge of the Metropolitan Police. Some pretty important people complained directly to him about a drug dealer they had taken a disliking to, they gave him your name and address. I figured seeing as I was about to owe you a favour anyway, you'd want me to warn you that my dad is going to organise a raid on your house at some point, probably tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Who snitched?" Badiha asked, her voice calmly masking the intense anger and fear she was feeling.</p>
<p>"I didn't recognise them, but they had a judge picked out to give a speedy search warrant and even called in a favour to clear the desk of the QC they want prosecuting you. So they are connected and angry, that's for sure."</p>
<p>"Oh, well thanks for letting me know." Badiha replied. "I'll be in touch."</p>
<p>Badiha hung up the phone and swore loudly to herself. She had a day to clear the house of any hint of drugs and prepare herself for a raid, while trying to figure out who seemed to hate her so much. The only positive was that at least her next client had been chosen by circumstance.</p>
<p>"So you're telling me there are no drugs on the property?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm afraid you got a bad tip."</p>
<p>"And the CCTV cameras you've set up inside your house, that's normal behaviour?"</p>
<p>"Well after someone broke in and stole my phone, laptop, and all data storage devices, I decided to beef up my security. It also has the benefit of catching any bad behaviour. So if, hypothetically, the police wanted to plant evidence they wouldn't be able to."</p>
<p>"This all seems very convenient."</p>
<p>"It would only be convenient if I were a criminal. But as I said, it looks like you got a bad tip."</p>
<p>Badiha spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to adapt the historical story Nicole wanted to live through. She wanted Nicole to go through the full emotions of her ancestor Merle, the feeling of triumph, the betrayal, the disgraceful turn in fortunes, but not have it strictly be a historical reenactment. Not only would it have raised suspicions if Badiha sent Nicole an invitation to join a Viking hellcat raid near Sheffield, but any historical inaccuracies would certainly be seized upon by a women who decided to summarise herself as 'fascinated by history' rather than 'history professor at UCL' as Badiha discovered in subsequent research.</p>
<p>Badiha instead updated the narrative, researched locations that would reconcile the modern world with the classical feel Nicole was after, and then started working behind the scenes to give Nicole a thorough thank you for the favour she had already done. She felt a bit resentful of being forced into this situation, as the plan would mean hiring outside help which she had been reluctant to do in the past, but she was assured the male sex workers she picked out were simultaneously the most understanding of the situation, talented at domination, descrete, and trustworthy.</p>
<p>But they would say that wouldn't they.</p>
<p>"How are you not freezing?" The research assistant quipped as he stepped off the plane, wrapping himself tighter in a jacket made to be trendy in and around Camden rather than fight off the cold winds of Inverness.</p>
<p>"Viking blood courses through my veins." Nicole replied walking across the runway tarmac and hoping the university had at least paid for a big enough rental car to comfortably hold the party of five that had been sent to verify a single historical artefact. "Besides it's not that cold, just fucking windy."</p>
<p>The supposed discovery was a Danish style Viking axe, whose presence this far into Inverness wasn't just a unique find, it also directly contradicted Nicole's central thesis in her doctoral research about Viking incursions into Scotland.</p>
<p>Nicole was sent to verify, along with a snotty research assistant who swore he was 20 but Nicole thought he looked 12, a graduate student that Nicole was supervising as she did her dissertation, an administrator who was there to collect receipts, and a chemist she knew who was a dab hand at identifying metals. She felt confident this group would be able to tear apart any claims that this artifact was authentic and that confidence got her through the cramped drive to a large loch where the representative from the University of the Highlands and Islands was waiting with a boat.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"Alright." The large hairy man growled through his beard loud enough to be heard over the wind. "I'm Dr. Malcolm Comyn. You must be the UCL gang."</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm Dr. Nicole Quinn..."</p>
<p>"Ah, the person we've discredited." He interrupted with a guffaw. "I'll drive you and your gang to the castle ruins on the island where we found the axe. Don't worry, this certainly isn't the first time a tall blonde Scandinavian has been defeated by Scottish elbow grease."</p>
<p>"Well that remains to be seen." Nicole curtly responded as she began to help her friends into the boat.</p>
<p>"As long as you are graceful in defeat I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time. The castle ruins are beautiful and the island is completely undisturbed. Hell, I'm sure our project lead would be happy to accommodate you if you want to stay a bit longer after you've verified the axe." He explained, trying to come across as friendly but making Nicole's blood boil.</p>
<p>They reached the makeshift docking area at a beachy inlet and under the supervision of a rugged band of 5 of Dr. Comyn's coworkers, all equally poorly groomed men, climbed down from the boat.</p>
<p>"Wow, when they said some fancy expert was coming from London, I assumed we'd be getting some crotchety old man. You are much younger and more beautiful than I was expecting." One of the men yelled.</p>
<p>"Hey guys, how much would it cost to conveniently leave your boss behind when you take the boat back?" A different man yelled.</p>
<p>"Couple of grand each and we'll throw in authenticating the axe for free." The chemist joked. Nicole shot him a look that could have deep fried him on the spot while the gathered researchers laughed.</p>
<p>The researchers guided Nicole and her group through the castle ruins towards the trenches they had dug and the artifacts they had collected. Nicole and her group giggled at the amateur trench layout, looking forward to teaching these hobbyists basic archeology.</p>
<p>The man who had driven them over in the boat opened up the tent and showed them to the tray that held the axe that had prompted this whole visit. Nicole took one quick glance at it then immediately burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"Seriously?" She blurted out. "That axe head is way too thick, no Viking would carry something so unwieldy, and if they did manage to swing it the head would go flying off that poorly wedged haft."</p>
<p>The gathered UHI team awkwardly shuffled on their feet as Nicole laughed with relief that her career was not going to be toppled by the cocky man from the boat.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid Nicole is probably right." The chemist interjected over Nicole's laughter. "If it was iron, as I would expect from a weapon from that era, it would be more corroded than this example."</p>
<p>"So now we have established you have a forgery on your hands, we'll be taking that boat back to the mainland." Nicole ordered, wiping a tear from her eye.</p>
<p>"So you don't want to stay? Even if the axe was a fake it would be nice to have you around." Dr. Comyn asked.</p>
<p>"Sorry, you can't be serious. Five minutes ago you were salivating at the thought of destroying my career, and now you want to be all chummy, no thanks." Nicole stated.</p>
<p>"Alright then, our project lead is on the second floor of the keep over there, go give her the bad news and we'll get your friends loaded up on the boat." Dr. Comyn explained.</p>
<p>"You go ahead, I'll take your bag." The research assistant offered. Nicole nodded and handed him her backpack as she strolled off eager to rub her expertise in the face of someone more senior.</p>
<p>The keep was the least dilapidated of the castle, the crew had made a good strategic use of tarpaulins to fill the gaps in the thick stone walls and make the ruins into a serviceable base of operations. Nicole walked off on her own, pushing the tarp door/curtain out of the way and making a beeline through the lantern lit halls towards the stairs.</p>
<p>As she ascended the stairs, the building's atmosphere took a surprising turn. The cold green tarpaulins suddenly gave way to furs and fabrics, warm but surely impossible to keep clean and dry long term. She entered the second floor room and was faced with something halfway between a royal court and a dungeon. Rich reds and blues covered every surface, furniture created a welcoming and relaxed environment, and a series of racks and devices added a threatening edge. Sitting at the far end, on a grand chair that was not specifically a throne, wearing a grand dress that was not specifically a queen's outfit, was an Asian woman who looked vaguely familiar to Nicole.</p>
<p>"Dr. Quinn, it is a pleasure to meet you." She welcomed.</p>
<p>"Sorry I didn't catch your name, although it won't be necessary, I am just here to inform you that your axe is a fake."</p>
<p>"Is that all? You seem very interested in some of my devices, would you like to stay to try them out?" Nicole did not like how she was looking at her. The general familiarity of the men she had met so far was one thing, but this woman felt like she was looking directly into her mind. Nicole had been able to leave her idle fantasies at home with all the excitement of the day, but to have them suddenly dredged up against her will with the first sentence said to her by a stranger was off-putting.</p>
<p>"I'm... I'm sure you'd like that, but I'm on professional business." Nicole nervously replied.</p>
<p>"Of course, we tend to get a bit unprofessional around here. Oh the things we would do to you if you weren't here with your colleagues." The woman chuckled, standing up and dramatically looking out of the window.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure what you are implying, but..."</p>
<p>"Nothing is being implied." The woman interrupted. "I'm stating a fact that you are trapped on an island with all these devices and a woman with a wicked mind. I know that given the freedom to do so without prying eyes, I could have you run the gambit of these machines."</p>
<p>"I'm not going to take this. I'm not talking to you any more without one of my colleagues present." Nicole snapped, putting her foot down and trying to reclaim the situation from this woman's sadistic machinations and the awakening deviant at the back of her mind gaining more enthusiasm for these dangerous desires.</p>
<p>"Oh we might have a problem fulfilling that wish. You see, your Viking Hellcats just took my bribe to betray you. I'm watching them heading back to the mainland on the only boat right now."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about..." Nicole began, she joined Badiha in looking out of the window and indeed her whole team were speeding away as fast as the boat could go.</p>
<p>"So Merle, moments ago you were victorious, triumphant in your defeat of an enemy. Now your allies have been bribed to betray you and leave you at my mercy, you cannot leave this island without my say so and I plan to extract a heavy price for that. How does it feel having your victory turn to humiliating defeat so quickly."</p>
<p>Nicole quickly realised what was going on, she suddenly realised this woman who seemed to know her desires so well wasn't some mythical mind reader or pervert who got lucky. It was the woman she had specifically requested this treatment from. If this was the depth of her commitment to perversion, she could only imagine what she was going to be in for in the coming days.</p>
<p>"Tell me, and yourself, that you are now my prisoner." Badiha ordered.</p>
<p>"I am now your prisoner." Nicole obeyed.</p>
<p>"Do prisoners get to wear clothes?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"No, my queen." Nicole replied, improvising well to the new circumstances. She gingerly began to remove her clothes, her hands shaking with sudden humiliation. It took some time as she had dressed in layers but eventually she was stood naked in front of Badiha's patronising gaze.</p>
<p>"So you really are a barbarian invader from the wilds aren't you." Badiha taunted, running her hand through Nicole's untrimmed blonde pubic hair. She picked up Nicole's clothes and searched through them, as luck would have it the lack of pockets in her professional outfit meant Nicole had taken to keeping her phone, purse, and any other valuables in the backpack currently on the speedboat with her research assistant. She bundled the clothes into a vague pile and casually threw them out the window, then she took out the screw fastener manacles she had bought for the occasion. Nicole did not put up any resistance as she fastened her hands behind her back.</p>
<p>"The safe word is anachronism." She informed Nicole, before clicking an iron collar around her neck and fastening it to a length of chain she held in her hands. "Let's go reintroduce Merle to the army she thought she had defeated."</p>
<p>Badiha roughly jerked Nicole out of her stationary position, before pulling her at a steady rate towards the exit. Nicole meekly struggled against her bonds and Badiha couldn't tell if she was genuinely struggling or just playing along, but as the safeword remained unsaid she kept pulling.</p>
<p>Nicole went crimson with mortification as she was pulled out of the castle and proudly displayed to the assembled sex workers that Nicole had paid to pretend to be UHI researchers. A celebratory cheer rose up among the gathered men as Badiha handed Nicole's chain to one of them.</p>
<p>"Malcolm, give our prisoner a tour of the facilities." She announced. "She wanted to be dragged through swamps so make sure that body of hers comes back covered in filth."</p>
<p>Nicole screamed and struggled as the man who had formerly introduced himself as Dr. Comyn began to drag her towards the muddiest part of the island and Badiha had a chat with the remaining men.</p>
<p>"We're not going to have any trouble with the others she was with?"</p>
<p>"Nah, you were pretty persuasive when you told them you were an old friend of Nicole's planning a prank followed by a surprise holiday. The little guy left her backpack in the hold in the boat so she can have it back once we're done."</p>
<p>"Very good Hamish. Now I've made sure the island will be undisturbed for the rest of the week, she doesn't know how long we have this place for so make sure to sell it that we have her until she submits and becomes a sex obsessed maniac. You can do any creative ideas you have, but she does have the safe word 'anachronism,' so stop if you hear that. Her friends say she handles cold well and the weather forecast is for warm days ahead, but that doesn't mean she won't lose a limb to frostbite if you leave her out naked at night so make sure to have her either by a fire or in the insulated dungeon we prepared after hours."</p>
<p>"Are you not sticking around then?" Hamish asked.</p>
<p>"I'm the organiser. I was just here to make sure everything went to plan. I'll be back in a couple of days to check in but you guys will be taking the lead."</p>
<p>"Oh." Hamish sighed as he awkwardly looked at his feet. "It's just the boat won't be back until tomorrow.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ, so I'm stuck on this mud pile as well?" Badiha exclaimed, annoyed that she had trapped herself with the same plan that had trapped Nicole. "Fuck... do you have the number of the guy with the boat?"</p>
<p>"I do but it won't do you much good. We're on an island in a loch in the middle of nowhere. You think anyone's bothered to put up a mobile antenna nearby?" Badiha checked her phone and indeed was getting no signal. "We've got the tent village in the courtyard if you want me to set you up with one?"</p>
<p>"No thanks, I got that sudo-queen's quarters I set up that has enough fur and sheets to cobble together a bed for the night." Badiha sighed.</p>
<p>Badiha mumbled to herself as she started rearranging her room. She was trying to see the appeal of being trapped somewhere, after all circumstances had made her a prisoner too and she wasn't a fan. She supposed Nicole had the added benefit that her imprisonment came with a purpose, and without any stress of her having to figure out what to do about it. Badiha had to figure out what she was going to do when the boat came back, worry about if the hotel would cancel her reservation for not turning up, and reconcile a bunch of different plans and worries she would have had completely in hand if she was on the mainland. Nicole was told she was going to be a sex slave for the foreseeable future and all of the choices and plans she had were no longer her concern.</p>
<p>"I need a real vacation." Badiha sighed as she tested out the softness of her makeshift bed.</p>
<p>Badiha headed out of the keep to the tent city, the boisterous laughter informing her of where her captive was and her suspicion that her presence meant dinner and a show for the gathered men.</p>
<p>The men had set up a campfire and were cooking jacket potatoes on it, nearby Nicole was already a state, she was covered in mud from the excursion her captors had taken her on and now her chain was being passed around as each man was taking it in turns to fuck her face. The men cheered as Badiha made her entrance.</p>
<p>"Thank you, how fairs our captive, she looks like shit." Badiha announced.</p>
<p>"Yeah, she fell over in the mud a couple of times." Malcolm replied.</p>
<p>"I hope you took the opportunity to avail yourself of her cunt, she is not off limits to ravishment at any time." Badiha announced, cognisant that all her workers had been tested for STIs before they got their post on the island, and that she had given them a large enough stash of morning after pills to keep a brothel from social service visits for a month.</p>
<p>"Indeed I did, she certainly wasn't expecting it."</p>
<p>"So now she appears to be servicing you with her mouth..."</p>
<p>"Ah yes, a little mealtime entertainment, we told her she can have a shot of mead for every man she can make cum before they finish their drink." He announced.</p>
<p>"Have you given her any of the shots yet?"</p>
<p>"No, but she's earned two so far."</p>
<p>"Very good, I will take them. I want Merle to be fully here for her first night. No retreating into an alcohol fuelled delirium, she needs to fully come to terms with her place as a sex object." Badiha ordered. To drill her point home she pointedly poured herself two shots, draining each both while not breaking eye contact with Nicole.</p>
<p>This game the men had constructed continued as Badiha ate her meal, every so often she would stop to have another shot of mead to celebrate Nicole pleasuring another man to completion. By the time the sun was going down Badiha found herself quite tipsy.</p>
<p>"Hey Merle, there's still one person here you haven't made cum. Come on, let's see how good that tongue of yours is." Badiha yelled to gathered applause. She pulled down her knickers, then promptly forced Nicole to crawl up her dress and get to work.</p>
<p>Badiha wondered if it was a coincidence that she ended up getting unplanned oral sex from every women she performed her services for, before her drink lowered inhibitions allowed her to acknowledge to herself that she loved powerful women lowering themselves to licking her out. Eating her pussy was the ultimate act of submission and she had some powerful women queuing up to pleasure a drug dealer from Tower Hamlets.</p>
<p>"Hey, we can't see the show." Hamish yelled. All they could see was the twitching under Badiha's dress. Badiha giggled as she slowly raised her dress, exposing Nicole and in the process herself. The moment her dress was lifted, Badiha felt a deep well of warmth spring from within her, she grabbed Nicole's head and forced her hard against her pussy, grinding herself against Nicole's mouth as she screamed her way to an orgasm. Once she had calmed down she gave herself a shot of mead.</p>
<p>Badiha squirmed in her makeshift bed, her mind racing with drunken thoughts swirling around her recent experiences. She tossed and turned and couldn't bring herself to sleep so she instead quickly wrapped herself in a blanket and made her way to the dungeon.</p>
<p>As she opened the door to Nicole's cell, she was struck by how warm and dry it was. This assuaged a bit of her guilt when she saw Nicole lying naked and exposed on the dusty floor. As she saw Badiha enter, Nicole sat up.</p>
<p>"Are you enjoying yourself?" Badiha awkwardly asked.</p>
<p>"No, but I'm enjoying how much I'm not enjoying it." Nicole replied.</p>
<p>"I don't understand that but OK."</p>
<p>"Really, you seem to get this life pretty well from what I've heard, and evidence from today is pretty compelling." Nicole stated, standing up to look directly into Badiha's eyes. "So why are you here?" Badiha swayed for a moment lost in thought.</p>
<p>"Late night trip to the toilet." Badiha quipped.</p>
<p>"I've got my bucket."</p>
<p>"And I've got my captured slave. Come on." Badiha replied, dangling her chain and collar for Nicole to put on.</p>
<p>Badiha's mind meandered from one thought to the next as she dragged Nicole behind her, she walked to her room in a fugue state, stripped down until she was naked, ordered Nicole to kneel beneath her then stood lost in thought for a long time.</p>
<p>"Umm... my queen, are you going to use me as a toilet anytime soon?" Nicole asked, confused by Badiha's behaviour.</p>
<p>"You're a powerful woman, why would you give that up?" She slurred.</p>
<p>"I'm not giving it up, when I get off this island I go back to my life, but for now I'm just putting aside my dignity and enjoying my fall into degradation." Nicole explained.</p>
<p>"I'm powerful on and off this island. Wherever I go I make sure I'm in charge, it's the only way to stay safe."</p>
<p>"I feel safe because I trust you. Even as a humiliated slave I'm not worried because you know what you're doing."</p>
<p>"So that's your crutch is it?" Badiha ranted. "The men are paid by Badiha, they obey her every command and respect her, they'd never double cross her or go against her plans. Badiha is going to make sure everything is fine so you don't have to feel real fear." Nicole started to look worried as Badiha's thoughts spun out of control. "Even like this, even with you naked and abused, I'm still serving your wishes and desires. I'm in charge but really it is you who is actually in charge."</p>
<p>Badiha pulled Nicole up onto her feet, her drunken wild smile beginning to scare Nicole. In a single fluid move she unclipped Nicole's collar and clipped it around her neck instead.</p>
<p>"I'm lowering myself to your level. You are to drag me like this to the tents where the sex workers are sleeping. In the middle of them all I'm going to lick your pussy until you orgasm, and if anyone wakes up and ask what's going on before I'm finished, you are to get them to fuck me." Badiha commanded.</p>
<p>"Wait, what?" Nicole stammered.</p>
<p>"I want to make you worry, really worry. So now your safety net is now a slave like you. How does that make you feel?"</p>
<p>"You're starting to scare me."</p>
<p>"Perfect, come on then, I'm now your slave, put those manacles on me and take me for a walk." Badiha ordered.</p>
<p>Nicole was very uncertain as she fastened Badiha's hands behind her back.</p>
<p>"So does this mean I'm not a slave any more?" She tentatively asked as she began to lead Badiha out of the keep.</p>
<p>"Oh you're still a slave. I just thought it was time that you realised how scary your position is, so now the person in charge of ensuring there are no negative repercussions from your desires is now the same status as you. The sex workers were paid generously and in advance, if they decide to capture me, treat you as a slave for longer than planned, maybe even force you and me into their line of work, there's nothing we would be able to do about it." Badiha thought aloud. She could see Nicole visibly shaking in front of her as they ventured out into the cold night air, partially from the cold and partially from the deviant mental breakdown her fixer turned slave was clearly going through.</p>
<p>As they ventured through the darkness, towards the glowing embers of the bonfire in the camp, Badiha decided the silence was a bit tense.</p>
<p>"I have a theory, above everything else I think men find power attractive. Looks, personality, all the things that men say they find attractive are all just elements of status that they covet, not to have or weild, but to destroy, to ruin. Their egos want a woman, a powerful woman willing to sacrifice it all to their perverted desires. See if we get discovered, I will immediately be the most desirable woman. Even though you are objectively more attractive, the average Pakistani girl with average tits doesn't hold a candle to the tall blonde Scandinavian with ample bust. We're both naked and waiting to be ravished. But up until recently I was the woman in charge whereas you were introduced as a whore for degradation from the moment you landed on the island."</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"We're getting close, you should probably keep your voice down." Nicole whispered.</p>
<p>"That's why you should be worried if they catch us. Not only will they be overjoyed to facilitate my fall from grace, I think they'll be thrilled with the look in your eyes when they tell you that plans are different now I am in their clutches."</p>
<p>Nicole stood next to the embers of the bonfire and pulled on Badiha's chain to force her to be kneeling at her feet.</p>
<p>"Alright, let's get this over with quickly." Nicole mumbled, trying to be as quiet as possible.</p>
<p>"Hang on, I want to savour this. Your pussy is going to be the first one I've ever eaten, doesn't that give you a little pride?" Badiha asked. Nicole shrugged her shoulders and Badiha gingerly leant forward with her tongue extended.</p>
<p>Badiha first felt Nicole's unshaved bush tickling her tongue, she moved further forward and ended up making contact with Nicole's labia, she gently began tease the lips apart with her tongue while unerringly continuing to lean forward until her bottom lip made contact. Nicole's pussy was now firmly in Badiha's mouth and she lapped at the wet lips until Nicole opened for her.</p>
<p>Once she had gotten a rhythm Badiha did not hold back, she began a deep kiss with lashings of tongue, only on lower lips than she had done so before. She looked up and in the dim firelight watched Nicole's face turn from concern to distraction and finally arousal. With her hands manacled behind her back Badiha couldn't check but she was certain she must be dripping wet, finally experiencing the dominated humiliation of pleasuring a woman who was supposed to be beneath you, memories of previous clients flooded through her mind.</p>
<p>Every rustle in the darkness, every gust of wind or tree branch swaying in the breeze made their hearts beat faster. Nicole began to moan and then clamped her hand over her mouth to stifle the sounds. Badiha felt Nicole's thigh muscles tighten against her cheeks as the shameful orgasm wracked her body. Nicole then pulled Badiha up to her height and gave a deep passionate kiss on the lips.</p>
<p>"Such a shame nobody woke up." Badiha quietly quipped. "I guess it's time I got you back to your dungeon, you have a full day ahead of you tomorrow. Believe me I have seen the devices."</p>
<p>Nicole quietly rushed Badiha back to the castle, and couldn't seem to get the manacles and chain off quickly enough. As Badiha drunkenly passed out on her bed, Nicole rolled her eyes before returning to her dungeon to rest up.</p>
<p>Badiha awoke to a headache drilling so deep into her brain it was about to strike oil. One of the men she had hired was gingerly trying to rouse her as she quickly moved to cover her body with a blanket.</p>
<p>"Sorry to bother you Badiha, but all the devices are in this room and..."</p>
<p>"No problem." Badiha spluttered. "Give me a moment to get changed and you can have the room." She threw on her underwear and dress, before heading out into the morning sun, passing Nicole, who had been rinsed with fresh water from the loch, being roughly pulled by her leash. As she got to the camping area, she saw a kettle boiling over a gas stove and began salivating.</p>
<p>"If there is a coffee going I will be your friend forever." She announced to the man with the kettle and soon had a warm mug of brown in her hands. It took her some time but eventually Badiha was able to transform herself from hungover mess to barely functioning human and felt that was enough to return to her room to see what devices were being used on her client.</p>
<p>As she entered the room she found herself immediately facing Nicole's bottom. Nicole had been placed in a pillory, her pussy freshly dripping with cum as Malcolm wiped his penis on some nearby rags.</p>
<p>"Ah Badiha, just in time. This bitch started screaming when I tried to fuck her in the ass, apparently she doesn't have a lot of experience in that area, so I was just about to get the pear of anguish to help her out." Malcolm explained.</p>
<p>"Very good." Badiha acknowledged as Malcolm began to rummage through the chest of rudimentary torture devices. Badiha leaned in to whisper in Nicole's ear.</p>
<p>"As far as anyone is concerned, last night never happened. You went to sleep and were undisturbed until the morning, is that clear." She sternly whispered. Nicole flicked a cheeky grin at her and Badiha contorted her face into the most intimidating shape she could. "I'm not joking. Nobody is to know what happened last night, OK?"</p>
<p>"What you talking about over there?" Malcolm enquired as he returned with his tool.</p>
<p>"I was telling her there's no such thing as a deer of anguish, so we assumed autocorrect got in the way and she meant pear of anguish. Which do exist and were simple to acquire." Badiha took the pear of anguish from the man and dangled it in front of Nicole.</p>
<p>The pear of anguish was a metal device, shaped like a pear attached to a stick, it actually consisted of 4 segments that would spread out when the screw at the end of the handle was turned. History records such a device utilised to painfully widen any hole it was put into, and Malcolm had made it quite clear which hole he had in mind.</p>
<p>"You're not going to actually damage her are you?" Badiha subtly whispered to him.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Nicole isn't the first person I've used one of these on, although she is the first woman. Nevertheless I know what an anus can take and that's what she'll get." Malcolm replied as he spread lubricant over the pear.</p>
<p>Badiha was fascinated as Malcolm inserted the pear into Nicole's rectum and she began to moan in aroused trepidation.</p>
<p>"Now slave, are you looking forward to having a stretched hole?" Malcolm taunted.</p>
<p>"No, master. It's going to be painful." Nicole honestly replied.</p>
<p>"That's not the attitude that's going to get you off this island." Malcolm chastised. "Try again."</p>
<p>"Umm... yes master, a widened anus can fit more cocks in it."</p>
<p>"She can be taught." Malcolm triumphantly announced, turning the screw and widening the pear. Nicole screamed with humiliating pain, but her scream subsided into a growl of aroused anticipation.</p>
<p>"Thank you master, please widen my anus further so I can be a better cock holster." Nicole begged.</p>
<p>Badiha was surprised at how during actual torture Nicole was far more comfortable and confident than she was last night on the other end of the leash. Malcolm widened the pear further and Nicole's screams warped into laughter.</p>
<p>"Now we're just going to leave you spread open for a couple of seconds to get used to this setting so we can spread you wider in a moment." Malcolm taunted, beckoning Badiha over to look at his handiwork.</p>
<p>Badiha couldn't believe the intimate view she was getting when she was startled out of her stupor by Hamish.</p>
<p>"Hey Badiha, the boat is here." He announced.</p>
<p>"Thanks Hamish. Now I'm going to leave you in these capable hands. They have all the time in the world and the most unspeakable devices I could get. So by the time I return I expect you to be a sex maniac. I want all thoughts of your humanity wiped from your mind and replaced only with a singular drive to do whatever it takes to give these men the deeply deviant pleasure they desire. Is that clear?"</p>
<p>"Yes my queen."</p>
<p>The wind blew in Badiha's hair as she watched the island grow closer. She had left Nicole alone with the sex workers for four days and was fascinated by the prospect of what would be waiting for her. They only had the island to themselves for two more days so she was hoping that whatever state Nicole was in would be enough to justify letting her go back to the mainland so they could credibly say mission accomplished and start packing up.</p>
<p>As the boat pulled up to the island, Malcolm was waiting for her by the docking area with Nicole by his side, she was stood with her legs apart and hands behind her head. At some point they had shaved her pussy and clearly done some punishment before she had arrived to make it glow red.</p>
<p>"Hello Malcolm, how is our captive?" Badiha pleasantly asked.</p>
<p>"I'd say thoroughly broken." Malcolm replied, proud of his handiwork. "Cock holster, give your benefactor an update on your progress towards being a mindless whore."</p>
<p>"Master has named me cock holster. I am proud of that name. I have worked hard to become the best cock holster." Nicole reported, her voice chirpy but controlled.</p>
<p>"I should probably point out we made sure to dumb down this braniac so she could be a real bimbo. She has been taught not to use words with more than two syllables, and no sentence she speaks can be more than ten words long." Malcolm explained before signaling to Nicole that she could continue.</p>
<p>"The pear has been used well. My cunt and ass can now swallow any size cock. My gag reflex is gone. Any pride I had has been fully erased. I will follow any order no matter what."</p>
<p>"Give your benefactor a list of the devices that have been used on you." Malcolm ordered.</p>
<p>"I have used the pear of anguish. The wooden horse. The rack. The St. Andrew's cross. I have had weights on my nipples and labia. I have been punished with whips, paddles and riding crops."</p>
<p>"As a grand finale, what have you been allowed to eat in the last 24 hours in preparation for your benefactor's visit?" Malcolm asked.</p>
<p>"Only cum and morning after pills." Nicole replied.</p>
<p>"Very impressive." Badiha exclaimed, stunned that Nicole had fallen so far as a result of her own instructions.</p>
<p>"If I could be so bold, Hamish has prepared some champagne to toast our success." Malcolm offered.</p>
<p>"It is bold of you to assume this has been a success. But you are right, standing in front of me is not a women any more, she is just a sex object."</p>
<p>"Thank you, my queen." Nicole replied.</p>
<p>The men gathered around the fire and gave a toast while Nicole busied herself serving champagne and offering everyone sexual favours. She seemed especially focussed on grinding herself against Badiha, subtly brushing past her, or bending over next to her to show off how overtly sexual she now was. The men seemed to be nursing their wine so they had barely finished their first flute by the time Badiha was draining her third glass, transfixed by the stories of Nicole's relentless humiliation while she was gone.</p>
<p>"Come on Badiha, I think it's time you sampled the goods." Malcolm eventually splurged. "Take her back to the device room and just have a good old go on her."</p>
<p>Normally Badiha would have declined the offer, but she felt relaxed by the champagne and fired up by the company, so she agreed, grabbed Nicole's hand, and dragged her away.</p>
<p>"What service would you like me to provide, mistress?" Nicole earnestly asked as Badiha entered the second floor room and pulled the tarpaulin curtain/door closed behind her.</p>
<p>"I want you to humiliate yourself. Bend over and spread yourself as wide as possible while barking like a dog." Badiha ordered. To her surprise Nicole immediately obeyed. Badiha laughed at the mess of a former human in front of her as her barks echoed off the stone walls.</p>
<p>"I'm glad my stupid cunt makes you laugh. If you strip down, I can pleasure you." Nicole offered. Badiha forgot herself as she removed her clothes and placed them to one side. Nicole began to run her hands up and down her body, caressing and kissing Badiha's most intimate areas as Badiha moaned at Nicole's enthusiastic servitude, lying down on the furs ready for pleasuring.</p>
<p>"These have been the best days of my life. They put me on the rack. They made sure I had no secrets. I pledged to serve any desire they had." Nicole explained between kisses. "So they know about the night you spent with me."</p>
<p>Badiha sat bolt upright.</p>
<p>"Their desire was to have one more cock holster." Nicole explained, backing away from the Badiha frozen in shock.</p>
<p>"Nicole you didn't..." Badiha began.</p>
<p>"Shhh, do you hear that? It's the sound of the boat leaving the island." Nicole sang. Badiha ran over to the window and saw the boat speeding away. As she was distracted Nicole picked up her clothes and threw them out of the window.</p>
<p>"Wait... no... I..." Badiha stammered, unable to find the words for her situation.</p>
<p>"How does it feel having your victory turn to defeat?" Nicole mockingly asked. "When you did it to me it felt so good."</p>
<p>"I can't do this." Badiha squeaked by way of reply.</p>
<p>"You can. You enjoyed the last time. I know you will love being a sex slave. You will love it as much as I do." Nicole insisted. "Tell me and yourself that you are now a slave."</p>
<p>Badiha balled her hands by her side. What Nicole had done to her was not too dissimilar to what she had done to Nicole. She was now betrayed and trapped at the mercy of the island. But it wasn't like Nicole was projecting, after that night she clearly knew Badiha was a kindred spirit. She wasn't sure about becoming a dehumanised slave like Nicole, but her wild smile made it clear that as a consequence of Badiha's actions, she now had no choice.</p>
<p>"I am now a slave." Badiha sobbed as she allowed Nicole to move her hands behind her back and slide the manacles around her wrists.</p>
<p>"Don't be sad. Soon you will be a happy cock holster like me." Nicole chirped as she placed the collar around Badiha's neck and began dragging her by the chain out of the room.</p>
<p>Badiha felt her stomach drop through the floor as she left the keep and saw the men, all gathered to see the fruits of their planning. She could see all their eyes scanning her body up and down, salivating at the thought of what they could now do with their former boss.</p>
<p>"I don't think they believe what's going on." Nicole noticed. "You should tell them." Badiha felt her body shake with humiliation as she looked at her bare feet on the muddy ground.</p>
<p>"I have become your prisoner while you train me to be a cock holster." She mumbled. Nicole gave her an almighty swat on the bottom.</p>
<p>"Come on. This is the best thing to happen to a slut. You are a slut. So eyes up, big grin, and yell loud and clear." Nicole ordered. Badiha needed to take a few deep breaths before she could steady herself enough to obey Nicole's commands. Eventually she looked up, plastering a big grin across her face and suppressing the waves of shuddering humiliation at the eyes on her naked captured body long enough to announce.</p>
<p>"I am now your prisoner. Please keep me locked up while you train me to be a horny sex object like this bitch." Badiha yelled. All the gathered men cheered except for Malcolm.</p>
<p>"Urgh, didn't like that." Malcolm replied, cutting through the cheer and stepping forward to look Badiha in the eyes. "You're still acting like you have a working brain between those ears. I like my sex slaves to be horny idiots. So to make sure no complex thoughts are entering that pretty head of yours. From now on one syllable words only, sentences cannot be longer than 5 words. Am I clear?"</p>
<p>"Yes sir," Badiha responded.</p>
<p>"Now then, do you want to try your announcement again with these new rules?" Badiha gritted her teeth as she thought through his request, then once again plastered a smile on her face.</p>
<p>"I'm now a sex slave." She yelled. "Please fuck me. I'll be a dumb slut."</p>
<p>The taunting laughter seemed to slice right through Badiha, dicing her ego to shreds in front of the sex workers she had paid.</p>
<p>"Alright, let's see how good a slut you are." Malcolm announced, forcing Badiha to her knees and liberating his hard cock from his trousers. Nicole hummed with depraved memories as Badiha gingerly wrapped her mouth around his shaft. The moment his cock was in her mouth, Malcolm thrust himself forward. Badiha immediately gagged, pulling away from the blow job.</p>
<p>"How disappointing, I was barely halfway down your throat when you started gagging. We'll have to work on that."</p>
<p>"I'm s..." Badiha began before changing her mind. "My bad." Malcolm gave a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>"At least this bimbo knows her place. It sounded like you were about to say 'sorry' before you remembered your cock addled brain couldn't wrap itself around such a complex word." Malcolm acknowledged. "But I think it's important for you to apologise when you let yourself down, so you may say 'sorry' whenever you want. But no other two syllable words."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I failed." Badiha replied as she braced herself for the assault on her throat that Malcolm was planning.</p>
<p>Malcolm tried a couple more times to see how long he could hold his cock down Badiha's throat, each time getting further and holding it for longer before Badiha's choking gags pushed her away.</p>
<p>"So that's a solid F on your throat. How good is your ass at taking a cock?" Malcolm asked.</p>
<p>"My ass is not trained." Badiha replied.</p>
<p>"Well if I go gung ho and put my cock in there without training I might damage you. In which case tonight you will be working our cocks with your cunt as that appears to be the only part of you worth a damn."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry..." Badiha began.</p>
<p>"Nope, you've lost the right to speak in the first person." Malcolm interrupted. "Third person only, and you are to refer to yourself as 'cunt', as that's the only part of you that is good for anything."</p>
<p>Badiha was shocked at how Malcolm had clearly been refining his domination skills with Nicole and was now starting with the innovations he knew worked. Badiha couldn't help but be impressed, controlling her speech meant Malcolm was in control of how she thought through her expressions as she constructed her sentences. It gave him a foothold in her mind.</p>
<p>"Cunt is sorry." Badiha replied.</p>
<p>"Alright it's dinner time." Malcolm announced. "And Cock Holster has done such a good job today I think she has earned some proper food and the right to pleasure herself."</p>
<p>"Thank you master." Nicole acknowledged, her face genuinely beaming with pride.</p>
<p>"As for our new cunt, she can have leftovers, but only once she has finished collecting cum from each and every man here in her pussy. Is that clear?"</p>
<p>"Cunt will do so." Badiha replied.</p>
<p>That night Badiha had flashbacks to the playful torment that they had put Nicole through on her first night. Badiha was forced to go man to man offering them her pussy, monosyllabically begging for sex while being insulted and degraded as the men sat around the fire trying to eat beans on toast. After a bit of time the men started finishing their dinners and taking Badiha's body for pudding. She was surprised how readily her dripping wet pussy allowed their cocks to slip in. She felt profoundly violated the first time she felt the man surging inside of her, his seed filling her up and dripping out of her, but she didn't have that much time to swim in the feeling before the next man bent her over and began to have his way with her.</p>
<p>Badiha felt quite raw by the time all the men had finished fucking her. Nonetheless before she was allowed to eat the meagre table scraps left for her, she was forced to stand in front of the group and announce.</p>
<p>"Cunt thanks you. Cocks are the best."</p>
<p>After a dinner of crusts and bean juice, with a morning after pill on the side, Badiha was led away with Nicole and they were both thrown into the dungeon for the night. Badiha was still manacled and dripping with cum as she lay on the ground.</p>
<p>"Don't worry Nicole, it shouldn't be too long until..." Badiha began, but Nicole interrupted her with a slap across the face.</p>
<p>"Cunt is still a bimbo." Nicole admonished. Badiha was shocked by the depth to which Malcolm had broken Nicole's mind. Even with nobody else around she was still fully into the role of sex slave, Badiha wondered if she would go a similar way if left to his devices.</p>
<p>"Cunt is sorry." Badiha replied, getting ready to get used to her new vocabulary in the long haul. "You know what comes next?"</p>
<p>"Master has not used any devices yet." Nicole informed. Badiha's face sunk at memories of the pear of anguish. "Why are you sad? You will get a slut's body to match your brain."</p>
<p>"Cunt is scared."</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>"Cunt will be happy when they are done."</p>
<p>Badiha was awoken first thing in the morning by Malcolm unceremoniously hoisting her off the ground.</p>
<p>"Have a good night?" He asked.</p>
<p>"Cunt slept bad." Badiha groggily admitted.</p>
<p>"A bit of sleep deprivation is good for the process." Malcolm acknowledged, "cock holster, we're going to be spending the day working with devices. So you can wander the island doing whatever you want. See if you can surprise me."</p>
<p>Nicole slinked out of the dungeon as Malcolm took Badiha's leash and led her towards the keep. Once in the keep, Malcolm locked Badiha in the pillory and then menacingly dangled the pear of anguish in front of her face.</p>
<p>"Where do you think this is going?" He menacingly asked.</p>
<p>"In Cunt's ass." Badiha replied.</p>
<p>"Very good." Malcolm chuckled, ruffling Badiha's hair before coating the pear with lubricant and disappearing out of Badiha's field of view.</p>
<p>Badiha felt a hot pressure building up on her anus as the pear was inserted, the pressure kept building and building until Badiha could barely take any more, then as the bulb of the pear passed her rectum it slightly subsided. She wiggled with humiliation as Malcolm walked back in front of her.</p>
<p>"That pear isn't coming out of you until you no longer have a gag reflex." He informed, taking a bottle of throat spray out of a bag. "Open wide."</p>
<p>Badiha had lost any will to resist and immediately opened her mouth. Malcolm sprayed some spray and her throat began to feel numb.</p>
<p>"That should help. Now if you find yourself starting to gag, make a fist around your thumb and squeeze." Malcolm advised. Badiha actually found herself grateful that her master would share such valuable tips for her to be a better whore. He flipped a lock on the base of the pillory and Badiha found the block containing her head and arms being lowered until it was the height of Malcolm's already freed cock. Badiha anticipated what was ahead and opened her mouth to accept his cock.</p>
<p>Badiha was proud when she felt his pubis bounce against her nose, she had taken his whole cock down his throat. But moments later her gag reflex resurfaced and Malcolm pulled himself out.</p>
<p>"Oh I forgot to mention, every time you gag, I give the screw on the pear of anguish a turn." Malcolm informed. Badiha let out a humiliated scream as he nipped around her and she felt the hot pressure suddenly grow on her anus. "Nothing like the pear stretching you during the muscle convulsions of gagging to give you a nice cock welcoming anus." Malcolm informed as he once again began to push his cock into Badiha's mouth.</p>
<p>Badiha's mind was a swirl of pain, shame, and pride as Malcolm repeated his devious process again and again. Badiha felt her body adjusting to its new purpose as her gag reflex began to retreat. Eventually Nicole entered the room in a huff.</p>
<p>"Cock holster, what seems to be the problem?" Malcolm asked.</p>
<p>"None of the others want to fuck me. They are saving their cum for cunt." Nicole sighed.</p>
<p>"Does seeing her gaping anus make you feel better?" Malcolm asked.</p>
<p>"No, just jealous."</p>
<p>"Very well, how about you get the double ended dildo in that bag, put one end in your cunt and use the other end to be the first person to fuck cunt up the ass." Malcolm suggested. Nicole giggled with glee as she began to rummage through the bag.</p>
<p>Badiha could not see what was happening at her other end, but she could feel the pear of anguish being loosened and then removed. Just as she felt the relieving release in pressure, her anus was violated again as Nicole began to thrust inside of her. Her anus had been stretched but now she groaned with burning friction as her ass began to be pounded from behind. Then, as she thought she couldn't get any more violated Malcolm returned to the other side of the pillory and once again stuck his cock in her mouth. Not with the slow relentless intrusion designed to make her gag, but now a powerful thrusting fuck of her throat.</p>
<p>Badiha's body shivered as hours of training and frustration reconciled itself with the overwhelming violation and physical sensations. Nobody had even touched her pussy that day, yet to Badiha's surprise, she felt her body being wracked by an orgasm. As she moaned and squirmed, she felt Malcolm's cock release a load of hot cum down her throat. As they finished up Malcolm released Badiha from the pillory and let her simply lie on the floor, drinking in her feelings of violation.</p>
<p>After some time Malcolm picked up Badiha off the floor and informed her it was lunchtime. They dragged her to the campfire where a bubbling pot of stew was being taken off the tripod ready to serve.</p>
<p>"Alright guys, serve me some dinner. While we eat how about our slaves put on a show? Cock Holster, tie Cunt to the tent pegs so she is staked to the ground." Malcolm ordered. Badiha surprised herself with how compliant she was to his devious schemes, lying on the dusty ground with her arms and legs spread according to his desires and not squirming as she felt Nicole tying the rope around her wrists and ankles. "Perfect, now go get my shaving kit, I want that pussy bald."</p>
<p>Badiha squirmed in trepidation for the eternity Nicole seemed to be gone for while her captors calmly ate their lunch. Eventually she returned and without warning Badiha felt shaving cream lathering up her privates. Nicole was thorough and efficient, it was not long before Badiha felt her pussy rinsed by a bucket of water from the loch, then the cold wind blew around her bare pussy. The men laughed and joshed at Badiha's predicament as she squirmed with her new sensations.</p>
<p>"That's more like it." Malcolm announced, finishing his stew and testing the heat on the side of the pot with his hand. "Cock Holster and cunt can share the rest of the stew, but I think it needs an extra ingredient."</p>
<p>Malcolm untied Badiha from the stakes and placed her bending over the pot, her pussy dangling over the leftover stew.</p>
<p>"You may eat the stew once three men have cum in your pussy. Cock Holster will make sure you have thoroughly dripped your sex juice into the mix before you can eat." He ordered as the men began to discuss who would fuck Badiha and in what order.</p>
<p>"Thank you master." Nicole replied, before giving Badiha a solid jab in the ribs.</p>
<p>"Sorry. Cunt thanks you." Badiha quickly responded as the first of the sex workers took his place.</p>
<p>Badiha had not eaten much by evening. She had been hesitant to eat a stew filled with semen and had only had a few bites while Nicole had wolfed down the rest, insisting she now loves the taste of cum and by the end Badiha would too.</p>
<p>Badiha quietly consoled herself that this was a learning experience, dipping her toe in the water her clients swum in before everyone had to pack up and leave tomorrow. She was sure she could keep herself together until then. She had spent the afternoon having her 'mind trained as thoroughly as her holes' as Malcolm put it. This involved a series of orders for her to obey to the delight of her masters. Each time she obeyed an order in a timely manner, the sex workers would shower her with praise.</p>
<p>"Well done Cunt, I didn't think you could handle 125 grams of weights attached to each nipple. You're really evolving into a terrific slut."</p>
<p>But at any slight, no matter how small, she would be whipped and belittled.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ Cunt, how can you call yourself an elite whore if you can't handle more than 20 minutes on the wooden horse without begging for release. Keep this up and you'll be tossed aside like the other useless fuckmeats who don't know their place."</p>
<p>The constant mood swings combined with Badiha's prohibition on multisyllabic words made clear thought difficult. Her senses betrayed her and while pain and pleasure were swirling together in her mind, she slowly found herself eager to please, her motivations taking the path of least resistance and telling her that being a good whore was the best way to get through the difficult day. When she was put to bed with Nicole that night she stayed silent until sleep took her.</p>
<p>Badiha was more hopeful as she once again awoke on the dungeon floor. Yesterday was an ordeal and it would take a while before the alterations they had made to her body and mind would fade away. But today was the day she had agreed with the park rangers that they would be leaving the island. Her training would be over soon.</p>
<p>She wasn't aware what had awoken her until she shook off the fog of sleep and realised she was overhearing a conversation happening outside the dungeon door, between Malcolm and a familiar voice that Malcolm had deliberately chosen to talk to within earshot.</p>
<p>"Did my boss really say we would be gone by today?" Malcolm asked. "She didn't tell me that."</p>
<p>"Yep, got the agreement in writing and everything." The ranger replied.</p>
<p>"That's typical of her." Malcolm sighed. "I can tell you are like me in hating that woman."</p>
<p>"Thank god you said it." The ranger acknowledged. "She was a right bitch to all of us. We don't usually let people just have an island like this but as well as being a relentless moaner she was pretty scary whenever we said no."</p>
<p>"I know what you mean. Could you imagine being in a position to teach her a lesson."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I've seen people like her before, big timers without any respect for anyone who doesn't have a six figure bank account." The ranger moaned. "But she has friends who could fire my whole department so I'm in no position to teach her some manners."</p>
<p>"What if you were?" Malcolm cryptically asked as he opened the door to the dungeon.</p>
<p>"Woah, what the fuck is going on here" the ranger yelled as he saw Badiha and Nicole in the cells.</p>
<p>"Cunt, explain to the man what's going on." Malcolm calmly ordered. Badiha froze for a moment, this was her chance to escape, she could plead with the ranger to get help, or at least leverage his presence to get Malcolm to let her go. As she was thinking through her response, his previous words outside the door echoed in her mind.</p>
<p>Badiha had never put much stock in what those who weren't her clients thought of her, she knew sometimes ruffling some feathers seemed to be the only way to get things done. But something about the her days as a slave had made it hit much harder than this man didn't like her. Yes, he was shocked and concerned now, but if she had never seen him again she would have been known to him as 'that bitch' for as long as he remembered having to deal with her, and that now bugged her.</p>
<p>She gazed around at Malcolm and Nicole, and felt very deeply that if she were to just sacrifice her ego, everyone in the room would be so happy with her, and she seemed to really want that.</p>
<p>"Cunt is sorry. Cunt was a bitch. Cunt is sex hole now. You want to fuck Cunt?" Badiha announced, aware of the smiles that filled the room.</p>
<p>"You serious?" The ranger stammered.</p>
<p>"She is. The reason we made arrangements for this island was for the training of sex slaves. Would you like to fuck either of them."</p>
<p>"Alright, get that bitch over here, I'd say she owes me a blow job after the way she treated me." The ranger agreed, it then surprised him how quickly after he had done so that Badiha crawled over to him on her hands and knees before kneeling up and unzipping his khaki trousers, speedily liberating his hard cock and shoving it down her throat. Badiha felt a deep well of shameful purpose as Malcolm and the ranger continued to talk about her while she serviced him sexually.</p>
<p>"So we were only meant to be training the blonde cock holster over there. But after seeing the process Cunt also wanted to be trained, she's been coming along nicely but I think we still need some time to really build her into the cock focussed slave she is meant to be." Malcolm explained. "So how much was she paying you for us to use this island?"</p>
<p>"Ah, she gave us £10,000 to look the other way for the week." The Ranger informed, struggling to keep his mind on figures.</p>
<p>"So here's a proposed arrangement. I don't want Cunt to leave this island until she is a fully trained fuck slave. So every day that takes, she'll pay you another £5000." Malcolm proposed. "Hell, if she's footing the bill, how about she throws in an extra £1000 every time you come to the island and fuck her?"</p>
<p>Badiha could feel the ranger's balls tightening, he was getting ready to cum on her face. She knew she should interject with Malcolm spending her money like that, she certainly knew she shouldn't be letting him just negotiate away her escape from sex slave training. But all her mind could focus on was that she was so close to making this man cum, and how pleased he would be with her talented mouth once she finished.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm sure I can swing that back at the office." The ranger agreed through gasping strains as he shot his load down Badiha's throat.</p>
<p>"Good, how about you Cunt. Are you happy to foot the bill so you can become the cock addled slut you were born to be?"</p>
<p>"Cunt will pay. Cunt must be good fuck." Badiha agreed, her insides feeling the warm glow of how happy everyone was with her performance and the prospect of what lay ahead.</p>
<p>Days didn't seem to matter any more. Badiha had no idea how long she had been on the island, only that every day was another chance to get better at being a fuck toy. She didn't know if today would be another day of violation, or just a day of painful predicaments with the unyielding devices while the men recovered, but whatever it was she felt up for the task. Malcolm entered the dungeon and Badiha and Nicole did their morning performance of fighting over who got to service him first.</p>
<p>"Alright calm down slaves. It's been 2 weeks since we started training Nicole, and me and the boys have agreed you are both now totally bimbofied sex maniacs." Malcolm announced.</p>
<p>"Thank you sir." Nicole and Badiha replied in unison.</p>
<p>"So I'm glad you enjoyed yourselves, but I'm afraid it is time for this holiday to end."</p>
<p>"Um... so what now?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"We take you back to the mainland and you get back to your lives." Malcolm answered.</p>
<p>"You could sell us as sex slaves." Nicole suggested.</p>
<p>"Cunt would fuck for you." Badiha added.</p>
<p>"If you ever want another holiday like this we would be happy to oblige. But you need to go back to your lives now." Malcolm reassured. "You are Badiha and you can talk normally."</p>
<p>"No, Cunt is Cunt. Cunt use dumb slut words." Badiha begged as Malcolm thrusted some clothes into her arms</p>
<p>It felt strange wearing clothes, being told that it was time to return to humanity. At first Badiha refused, begging Malcolm to keep her as his personal sex object. But eventually Badiha and Nicole found themselves silently on a boat heading back to the mainland.</p>
<p>While Malcom gave Nicole a lift to the airport, Badiha climbed back into her rental car, not looking forward to the late fees on returning it, not to mention wondering if the hotel will have held onto her stuff when her stay had ended and she had not returned because she was busy on an island having her mind and body trained in the most humiliatingly deviant purposes.</p>
<p>When she did get to the hotel, they had kept her luggage, but the man behind the counter wanted to charge Badiha a huge fee to get it back. Badiha's mind was screaming to offer to fuck him, tell him if he returned her luggage she would be his cock holster for the day, but she managed to take a deep breath and maintain her professionalism as she handed over her card.</p>
<p>Similarly the rental car office had also leveed some heavy charges that Badiha paid without offering to wash cars naked and fuck any staff member who wanted it. As the fog of eroticism lifted she found herself returning to her old ways of acting, but now there was always a voice in the back of her mind that embraced her deviation.</p>
<p>Once she was back home, she tried catching up on her emails and matters arising. She had to call in some favours to cover the expense of her trip, but it was a drop in the ocean for her friends. Every email now came with a little niggle at the back of her mind informing her not just to say yes to their request, but to join in.</p>
<p>In frustration Badiha stripped down and gave herself a long hard stare in the mirror. Her body didn't look much different, but she could now deep throat pretty much any cock, her anus had adjusted to constant violation, her lebido was now through the roof. Even just standing still staring at her reflection, all she could think was.</p>
<p>'You could do more. You could get some implants, have massive bimbo tits. Get some lip plumping injections and let everyone know this mouth wraps itself around a cock well. What about piercings? Get some nipple and clit bars so people can see your dedication to sluthood, maybe a sternum ring so you can be dragged around by the nose. You could get a tattoo, permanently mark this body as a slave...'</p>
<p>Eventually she turned away from the mirror and picked up a bottle of wine. Badiha was determined to forget about the experience of becoming a sex object, and the addictive joy of mindless sexuality.</p>
<p>Badiha was not able to turn her back on the niche she had created, but had instead resolved herself to be less involved in the next service she put together. It broke her heart to deny people the same glorious servitude she had enjoyed, but she had to turn down requests like Katherine Primrose's simply because she no longer had any faith in herself as a safety net. She had gotten lucky that, broadly speaking, Malcolm was an honourable man who had stuck to his word that she could go back to her life after her training was done, she couldn't guarantee that with anyone she handed the "golden ticket" to.</p>
<p>She also couldn't bring herself to engage with the core premise of Marissa Thompson's request. Before the island training she would have been happy to play the sadist and torment this couple but now every time she began planning a humiliating regimen of tasks the little voice in the back of her head would tell her how great and enjoyable her plan was and she would lose confidence in her sadistic impulses.</p>
<p>At the moment she was acting as a manager to a woman who wanted to be an influencer. It was a fascinating dynamic of calling in favours to get her sponsorship deals, and doing a slimmed down (and more importantly, remote) version of Malcolm's training regimen to get her more comfortable with the skimpy outfits and sexual poses that whatever slimming tea or NFT broker demanded of her that week. Henrietta was starting to really get noticed on the scene which filled Badiha with pride, but she didn't follow her posts as they were too much of a reminder.</p>
<p>Through this rigourous mental focus on her work, she has managed to cut herself down to only masturbating once a day, with painful self bondage or punishment only featuring about half of the time.</p>
<p>It was during one of these early sessions masturbating that Badiha received a call from a blocked number.</p>
<p>"Badiha, it's Clementine." The stern voice barked over the phone.</p>
<p>"Oh hello." Badiha replied, quickly covering herself with her duvet even though Clementine couldn't see her.</p>
<p>"So I'm calling to apologise and give you some money." Clementine informed, "that little police raid earlier, I'm afraid I was partially to blame for it. I'm not going to give you all the details, suffice to say the aggrieved party will not be coming after you again and I've decided to split the money I made off their backs with you by way of recompense."</p>
<p>"What's the catch?" Badiha sceptically asked.</p>
<p>"Honestly, I don't know. I never would have done this in the past but something about you makes me want to protect you against this horrible world you've waded into. You've been extra cautious in your choice of clients recently and I couldn't help but worry it's some latent paranoia since the raid."</p>
<p>"So you're still keeping an eye on me?"</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>"Yeah, I'll tell you what, I want to discuss this further. How about I come over so errant ears aren't listening on the phone." Clementine offered.</p>
<p>"Um, OK." Badiha agreed.</p>
<p>"Good because I'm right outside now." Badiha rushed to look out of her window and saw Clementine wave to her as she got out of her huge black car.</p>
<p>Badiha was a whirlwind of activity hiding evidence of her perversion and throwing in clothes in the minute it took Clementine to make her way up to the penthouse apartment. She was surprisingly pleased how presentable her life was as Clementine strolled in.</p>
<p>"Badiha, such a pleasure to meet face to face again. My daughter sends her... urgh... regards." Clementine announced as she handed Badiha her coat. "You've managed to keep a clean house."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well it is also my office." Badiha replied.</p>
<p>"Good, good." Clementine mumbled, sensing the tense staleness of small talk when there was a clear agenda at play. "Wine?"</p>
<p>Clementine pulled a bottle of cabernet out of her handbag, she found the wine glasses in the first cupboard she opened and was pouring before Badiha even responded to her offer.</p>
<p>"You're supposed to let it breathe a bit first." Badiha said just to cut the silence.</p>
<p>"Any aeration you desire from a wine can be achieved by swirling it in the glass, that's why restaurants don't need to leave open bottles lying around." Clementine bluntly explained, sitting at Badiha's dining room table and pushing Badiha's glass into a space in front of the seat she wanted Badiha sat down in.</p>
<p>"How many times have you felt guilty about causing problems for someone else?" Badiha enquired, sitting down and swirling her wine.</p>
<p>"I'll admit you are part of a pretty exclusive club in that regard, don't make me regret putting you on the guest list."</p>
<p>"So what was the scheme that got the police to my door?" Badiha bluntly asked.</p>
<p>"In due time. First I want to know how you beat the wrap and how you've been doing since." Clementine countered, her stern facade giving way to a look of clear concern.</p>
<p>"Nicole Quinn owed me a favour and decided I would be interested in hearing about the tip her dad got." Badiha explained.</p>
<p>"You made arrangements for Nicole's fantasy after the raid, so I'm guessing she presumed a positive response."</p>
<p>"Or she knew doing the favour ahead of time would force my hand."</p>
<p>"Either way there's a lot of people operating on good faith in this series of events. I try not to have things go so... informally." Clementine thoughtfully analysed, while Badiha could clearly see she was desperately trying to get to grips with Badiha's outlook.</p>
<p>"You think Nicole and I are both idiots for trusting each other when we had never even met, but you are also impressed with the results." Badiha cockily noticed taking a sip of her wine.</p>
<p>"And then after making good with Nicole you dropped off the grid. At first I thought you were trying to disappear, a lot of people do that after a close run in with the police. It usually ends badly for them as it says some things about their character that make me believe they would be a liability if they got caught. But I saw how you had checked into a hotel and figured you had just decided to take a vacation. Maybe your good faith method of operating was catching because it was a huge risk for me to just let you do that."</p>
<p>"Lots of people take vacations, not a reason to start sending goons after them." Badiha interjected.</p>
<p>"I once gave the benefit of the doubt to a friend who was 'taking a vacation', I didn't realise witness protection was his travel agent until it was almost too late. That night I had to do some pretty distasteful things to not end up on a less voluntary vacation of my own." Clementine explained, "so you must know people like you are not normally given this much leeway."</p>
<p>"People like me?"</p>
<p>"Contacts of mine, people I do business with, people who are the 'need' in 'need to know.'" Clementine quickly explained.</p>
<p>"Fascinating, I'm eager to hear more but our bottle is empty, want me to fetch another?" Badiha asked, not waiting for an answer as she walked to her kitchen.</p>
<p>"Good call, although could it be that nice French Merlot you bought recently rather than that ghastly Australian Pinot Noir you've taken to?"</p>
<p>"Sure, but only because that was such a casual way to admit that you are spying on my grocery shopping." Badiha quipped as she returned with the Merlot.</p>
<p>"Everyone wants the loyalty card vouchers these days and system admins are so underpaid." Clementine acknowledged by way of explanation.</p>
<p>"So you were hoping something in my shopping habits would get your daughter out of owing me a favour and then just kept an eye on it?"</p>
<p>"It wasn't regular viewing but I did pick it back up when you started acting strange. Since the raid you have been buying way more alcohol, plus you've turned down plenty of better offers in favour of remote managing this Henrietta girl."</p>
<p>"Having an influencer owe me her success is useful, just in case I need something disseminated to a mass audience at the drop of a hat." Badiha explained, Clementine gave the prospect some thought.</p>
<p>"Fine, I suppose that is a good insurance policy. I'm just not certain why you turned down Angela with the three last names. You would have had her in your pocket and blackmail material on that father-in-law of hers as a bonus. That family has plenty of money and could give you a foothold in technology, believe me having tech on your side is the best asset a fixer could have."</p>
<p>"And the job would have required me to be a stripper and risk that pompous ass taking out his class issues on me." Badiha explained. As she expected Clementine took this to mean that Badiha was uncomfortable with being in that situation, she didn't know that Badiha had turned it down because she was worryingly excited by the prospect. "Was it him that called the police on me?"</p>
<p>"Oh no. That was a whole other thing. So what are you getting out of these fantasies?" Clementine asked, trying to change the subject.</p>
<p>"Nope, you can't fob this off any more. If you want to keep discussing my business, I'm going to need to know how your business washed up on my door." Badiha asserted, putting her foot down. Clementine drained her glass and poured again.</p>
<p>"Fine, so I hit upon a scheme, some small time trader who wanted to go big and was willing to cut me in more than the average big timer. He works profit split and has enough company cash behind him to make big plays. So he comes to me asking if I knew anyone who looks over company accounts and could see bad news coming ahead of time. I do my thing and before long I have a good awful annual report for Aeris PLC held up for a day while my guy shorts their stock."</p>
<p>"Sounds profitable, but how does it affect me?" Badiha interrupted, disrupting Clementine's pride at a plan well executed.</p>
<p>"Patience, you'll be happy to know these sorts of schemes when my plan to get John Dobson promoted to treasury minister kicks in and he starts feeding us bad news for the currency markets."</p>
<p>"And you're stalling because you know I'm not going to like a detail of this story."</p>
<p>"Good insight." Clementine begrudgingly admitted. "Aeris PLC's accounts are signed off by Grace's father. The leverage I used to hold things up by a day was your activities with Grace."</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ Clementine. If word gets out my clients are being blackmailed there would be a lot of influential people who suddenly see me as a threat." Badiha yelled.</p>
<p>"Well I've made sure that it can't be linked back to you... now." Clementine admitted, Badiha had never seen her look guilty before, but this did not assuage her rage. "When I first made contact with Grace's father I did it anonymously. And since Grace seems to have made it her mission to find every person with higher than five figures in their bank account and tell them what great deviant fantasies you fixed for her, he assumed the blackmailer was you and called the police. I've now made him aware that I was the contact and you had nothing to do with it. I have also let it be known that I have made my tech available to keep your emails secure."</p>
<p>"Reassuring my clients while also providing an explanation next time you want to blackmail someone." Badiha raged.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, OK. I figured you were already blackmailing them so I might as well join in. I had no idea my actions would be such an outlier." Clementine apologised, rummaging through her purse for a cheque. "Here's your cut of the scheme, with a bit extra by way of apology."</p>
<p>"I don't want your money." Badiha stated, ripping up the cheque. "I'll tell you what, you now owe me a favour."</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ you really do have a brand don't you? I just confirmed that I cannot be trusted and your response is to trust me to be honourable in the future?"</p>
<p>"A favour from Clementine Maximus is nothing to be sniffed at." Badiha explained.</p>
<p>"Alright then." Replied Clementine. "But now we have that settled. I need to know what you are getting out of these fantasies. You're earning your money elsewhere and hoarding enough favours to make people wonder if you're plotting a coup. What's the end game?"</p>
<p>"I'm just doing what I'm good at."</p>
<p>"But you're clearly not into it, you won't get your hands dirty and you've yet to even meet face to face with Henrietta. I'm not sure why you're drinking and isolating more but I'm worried doing this type of work is starting to get to you." Clementine explained, Badiha looked into her eyes and saw beyond the concern, she read the subtext of the situation and said words she probably shouldn't have said unless she was 100% sure of them.</p>
<p>"It's starting to get to you isn't it? You've been reading through all these emails and it's planted some pretty dark seeds in your mind." Badiha observed. Clementine shuffled in her seat, awkwardly looking around.</p>
<p>"How could it not? So many women actually wanting to be humiliated and put at risk, you never wonder what it would be like to be in that situation?"</p>
<p>"All the time. It's what makes me good at what I do. Hell, my offer's still open if you want a fantasy of your own."</p>
<p>"Don't push your luck." Clementine snapped, which Badiha took as an overreaction to genuine consideration. "But what are your insights from this? Is it different reading idle fantasies to watching them come to life?"</p>
<p>"It is. I've always been fascinated by power, what it means to have it and what it can do for you. When the women come to me, they are powerful and I have them on their knees. But over time I have learned they aren't surrendering their power, they are testing it. They get to see that even when stripped of all possessions, liberty, and dignity, others will still act according to their demands. Every time I have released a slave back into their former life, I have confirmed they are more powerful than me."</p>
<p>"Fucking hell Badiha, when I wanted to know about power I just read Foucault, I didn't start a business providing next level sexual experiences." Clementine baulked.</p>
<p>"I think if you ever take me up on my offer, you'll understand."</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Badiha sat at home, scrolling through the photos of Henrietta posing naked in the men's toilets at the offices of a marketing corporation with an extensive online talent liaison department. Badiha had told her it was about demystifying the organisation before her meeting but they both knew it was about changing her headspace to one that was willing to sell her body.</p>
<p>Badiha's doorbell rang. Badiha sighed as she closed down the laptop so that if her guest was not friendly at least her clients would be protected. Good business sense but annoying to re-login through afterwards.</p>
<p>Badiha opened the door and a familiar girl stood on the other side, head bowed and bags packed.</p>
<p>"Grace, what's going on?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"My parents cut me off, cut me out of their life entirely. They stopped paying my rent so I've been evicted and need somewhere to stay." Grace explained.</p>
<p>"You don't have any friends willing to put you up?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I probably do, but the last time I was in crisis I was on a boat surrounded by friends. Yet you were the only one who actually stepped up to help me. I trust you." Grace explained, her eyes never leaving her feet.</p>
<p>Badiha knew that Grace was not acting rationally, she also felt a similar irrationality in her reaction. Grace was cut off, a favour from her was no longer worth anything, Badiha had nothing to gain from taking her in.</p>
<p>In that moment Badiha felt a rage well up inside of her, she had always harboured a low level anger at the women born into privilege, it fuelled her deviant designs in the days before her own mind was broken. But now, as she stared at this scared girl she felt a far larger fury at the world.</p>
<p>Grace's parents, her own mother and father had tossed her to one side. Not because she had turned on them, just because her behaviour had left them open to becoming pawns in games of the powerful. Holding up Aeris PLC's accounts had not cost her father a penny, but it had damaged his ego and reduced him to the position of being at the behest of someone else, a fate shared by 99% of the country who aren't disowning their daughters.</p>
<p>And when this horrible situation landed on someone, and she needed help, she couldn't even trust her own friends. The game of social status already having turned on her in the past.</p>
<p>Badiha's fury then turned to herself, her first thought when faced by someone in genuine need was to ask what was in it for her. This whole system of the powerful playing these games with one another had gotten to her as well and in her anger, she saw only one route to redemption.</p>
<p>"Absolutely, come on in and we can discuss what comes next for you." Badiha welcomed, opening her door wide for Grace.</p>


<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>Badiha comforted her new roommate as she sobbed her way through a bottle of wine and a tub of ice cream that night. She comforted her again a week later when it turns out her office's permissive attitude to her constant lapses in professionalism was motivated solely by fear of reprisals from Grace's father.</p>
<p>Badiha started this experience glowing in the aftermath of doing a good deed in a bad world. But when that good deed started to preclude her access to privacy to indulge loud and humiliating masturbation, her house guest became a reminder that kindness has consequences.</p>
<p>"Want to watch a movie." Badiha asked, trying to console Grace as she sat on the couch tearfully staring into mid air. "I know it's already late but I've got Netflix, Amazon Prime, all the videos of women I've put in humiliating situations, and Disney plus.</p>
<p>"Anyone I know?"</p>
<p>"Depends on your childhood but everyone knows Mickey and Goofy." Badiha joked. She wasn't yet at the point of sharing confidential details with Grace, hell Grace didn't even know about Badiha spoofing her phone to trap Aimee.</p>
<p>"You don't happen to have any videos of the time you made my fantasy happen do you?" Grace asked.</p>
<p>"No, I try not to take evidence unless it's part of the experience." Badiha explained.</p>
<p>"So my parents threw me out and there wasn't even any evidence? I really am fucked aren't I?" Grace sobbed as Badiha fetched another tub of ice cream from the freezer.</p>
<p>"I'm sure you are useful. Um, how about you help me with a client?" Badiha suggested, getting out her computer. "I have this girl I'm working with at the moment, the deal was to train her to remove her inhibitions in preparation for a career in modeling and influencing."</p>
<p>"I'm guessing you had her do sexual things?" Grace asked.</p>
<p>"She chose me, not a life coach. She must have known what I was about." Badiha reasoned. "So she's moved from isolated modeling shoots and product endorsements to attending a party with the intention of being seen by the influential people due to be there. I've already picked her out a pretty scandalous outfit, but I want to do something to make sure she doesn't freeze up and become a wallflower when she arrives."</p>
<p>"I'm unemployed, disowned, and currently on my second tub of cookie dough ice cream. Do I strike you as the best person to ask about confidence?"</p>
<p>"You know perversion better than me. I haven't been through anything like this." Badiha lied. "What deviant thing you did gave you the most confidence?"</p>
<p>"Hmmm. For me it was just having that secret. The feeling that I had deceived everyone into thinking I was a normal person." Grace mused.</p>
<p>"She's aiming to be an influencer, it's taken as read that she's not a normal person."</p>
<p>"Then have her do something no influencer would do. Have her go to the party thinking to herself, 'nobody knows I'm actually the kind of girl to...' I dunno... 'fuck a homeless person.'" Grace suggested.</p>
<p>"Bit risky and extreme, not certain how a homeless person would react, but you are onto something." Badiha acknowledged, seizing on Grace's insight. "What if Grace went to the party thinking 'nobody here knows I'm the kind of person who...' um, I feel there's something she can do with a bin or rubbish."</p>
<p>"How about she takes a naked selfie inside some communal bin, like some dumpsters. That way she'll have the photograph on her phone with her as she circulates at the party."</p>
<p>"Perfect!" Badiha acknowledged pulling out her phone to work out the details. "She'll have to choose a bin that won't have anything dangerous like broken glass in it, so I could pull some strings with a manager I know at Burger Hut to leave his dumpster unlocked and back alley CCTV turned off tonight. She can go after closing time and although it will be messy, it'll all be leftover food and drink in cardboard containers.</p>
<p>Badiha saw Grace smiling the only genuine smile she had done since arriving and all the frustration of her visit melted away.</p>
<p>"So I'd say you just passed a job interview with flying colours. How would you like to be my assistant?" Badiha asked. "I've been trying to be less hands on recently so I could use someone like you in the field."</p>
<p>"Wow, really? That would be great." Grace agreed. "But why are you trying to be less hands on?"</p>
<p>"Umm... how about this, if you complete your probation, I'll tell you. I promise you it's a juicy tale." Badiha promised. "And as an added bonus, it pays enough money for you to get a place of your own. Got to give you your space if you want to keep feeding the demon and working on your creativity."</p>
<p>"Wow, thank you so much. I'm going to work my hardest at this, you'll see." Grace ranted with a massive grin that suddenly turned to sombre again. "Last time I got a new job, my parents were the first people I told and they threw me a party. Now you're all I have."</p>
<p>"We can still celebrate." Badiha acknowledged, desperately reaching for something special to do. Her deviant mind was whispering in her ear that licking her pussy would be one hell of a celebration, but Badiha decided to indulge the spirit of the request rather than the letter. "Would your parents celebrate by getting you to do something really dirty?"</p>
<p>"No, but of course, you know I'm a deviant." Grace realised.</p>
<p>"Indeed. So to celebrate your new job I have a task for you. Go to the 24 hour off license across the road and buy us some champagne, and I hope you didn't eat too much of that cookie dough ice cream as that's all you'll be wearing." Badiha ordered as Grace's smile turned deviant.</p>
<p>Badiha gave Grace a playful swat on the way out of the door and a droplet of ice cream fell to the floor as she tentatively stepped out of the apartment. Badiha closed the door behind Grace and the moment she was alone she began rabidly stripping off her clothes to scratch her itch.</p>
<p>She stared at her naked body in the mirror, reminding herself of the days when she was at another's mercy just like Grace was. She fetched a large plug she bought after her island adventure as a celebration of her newly trained anus and watched as she eased it inside herself.</p>
<p>"I've missed this." Badiha sighed as she grabbed her wand and turned it up to full power in the hope of providing herself with some quick and loud satisfaction before Grace got back.</p>
<p>"Oh this slutty body has missed being violated." She told herself. "I bet I could continue even when Grace gets back. She's a fellow deviant, it's not like she's going to judge me."</p>
<p>Badiha squirmed and bit her bottom lip.</p>
<p>"This isn't about her. This is about you. This is about Cunt. Cunt is a dumb slut. Cunt can't be free. Cunt would fuck your life. Cunt would... would..." Badiha bucked and screamed to a powerful release. She quickly cleaned up and threw her clothes back on before sitting back on the sofa and taking some deep breaths to calm herself for Grace's return.</p>
<p>"So read it through again and tell me the opportunities and dangers present in this request." Badiha instructed as Grace stared at her laptop screen.</p>
<p>"It's hot, let's do it."</p>
<p>"They're all hot. This is the deep end of a dark pool, you're going to want to do everything suggested but it isn't about you. You want to just serve your own joy I'll add you to the list of prostitutes I can call on. I want you to think this through. Is it feasible? Can the fantasy end at the final whistle? Will a favour from whatever shred of humanity is left at the end of the adventure even be worth a damn?" Badiha rubbed her temples as Grace read through Susan Merdock's email again.</p>
<p>"Using someone she knows could be a risk. First you have to spend a lot of resources looking into her social circles just to see if there is anyone applicable, and even if you find someone how do you know after the fantasy is done his blackmail won't escalate to the point of social ruin for her?" Grace tentatively asked.</p>
<p>"Very good. I could just have one of my sex workers give her a seeing to then say it was someone she knows..."</p>
<p>"But you like to play things honestly and she may get suspicious if nobody steps forward to exploit her." Grace reasoned, smiling that she was starting to be more analytical. "It is hot though."</p>
<p>"If the only criteria were hotness I'd need an entire office building and would be ruined within the year." Badiha noted. "What are your thoughts on Lady Farrington-Smyth? Besides that it's hot."</p>
<p>"This Tara character sounds like our kind of person, this could be an in for a future contact." Grace explained. Badiha didn't have the heart to tell her that someone who would want them as her sexual slaves is the last thing either of them needed. She was certain if they took on this case it would ruin both of them but couldn't say as much without tipping her hand.</p>
<p>"We don't know anything about this Tara woman, if it turns out she's a danger just looking into her might draw more attention than we would like." Badiha informed. "Plus having Lady Farrington-Smyth in her clutches, do you think this Tara character will just let her come and go fully masked, or will she have that mask off the moment she sees the opening? And once she's in this woman's clutches what does that mean for the value of the favour she would owe us?"</p>
<p>"Alright I get it. So which one should we do?" Grace sulked.</p>
<p>"I can't choose for you, your first fantasy has to be one you think is right..."</p>
<p>"As long as you don't think it's wrong..." Grace snidely interrupted.</p>
<p>"Fine, you pick one out and as long as it isn't totally beyond the pail we'll do it." Badiha offered. Grace scanned over the emails before her face lit up.</p>
<p>"This one!"</p>
<p>"I have a reservation under the name... urgh... Fuck Slut." The upstanding woman hesitantly asked the man behind the hotel reception desk. Although she was not used to labelling herself as such, the hotel was certainly used to clientele using sexually suggestive sudonyms, in fact their entire model revolved around a permissive attitude to these sort of shenanigans. Far more unusual for this place was someone to be booking a room for multiple nights, it was a high price, low quality hotel nestled between the National Exhibition Centre and Birmingham Airport, perfectly located for busy travellers and conference attendees looking for some paid company to fit around their itineraries. The man handed over the keys to room 11 and told her check out was in a week's time.</p>
<p>She went to the room and sat quietly on the bed, fiddling with her phone, awaiting her fate. There was a knock on the door and the women answered to her expected guests, Badiha and Grace, each carrying a heavy suitcase.</p>
<p>"Everything go to plan?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"What little plan you deigned to share with me has paid off." She replied. "I'm still getting texts from the office so if this arrangement goes ahead I'll need time each day to reply."</p>
<p>"I know it is scary Suriya, but International Investments SA has an asset pool measured in the billions, they won't go out of business if you take a single week off." Grace reassured her as she uneasily sat back on her bed. They made the usual pre-session small talk discussing ground rules and safe words while remaining vague about what was coming up. There was a knock at the door and Badiha breathed a sigh of relief that they didn't have to stall any more. She left Grace behind as she went to answer the door and soon found herself face to face with Malcolm.</p>
<p>This was the first time Badiha had seen Malcolm since the island, although they had communicated by email and phone. Badiha didn't realise how much she would regress in his presence. Her mind began screaming at how wrong it was that she was wearing clothes and planning to speak to Malcolm like he wasn't her master.</p>
<p>"Badiha, good to see you again." He said by way of a greeting.</p>
<p>"Hi Malcolm." Badiha replied, getting ahold of herself and persevering. "So Suriya is in here. Remember you're just training her to be sexy and capable. No bimbo stuff. I want her to feel sexy as the human she is."</p>
<p>"You sure? You seemed to enjoy it." Malcolm joshed.</p>
<p>"I'd also rather you didn't bring that up." Badiha hissed before dragging Malcolm in front of Suriya. "Suriya I'd like you to meet Malcolm."</p>
<p>"Pleased to meet you Malcolm, are you one of the two to five people I requested?" Suriya asked.</p>
<p>"Not exactly." Malcolm replied, turning to Badiha to explain.</p>
<p>"So you said you wanted to be seen as a sexual being, so we wanted you to have interactions that confirm you are sexy and provide sexual services for others. Malcolm is here for your training to be a high end prostitute." Badiha informed as Suriya's eyes bulged wide.</p>
<p>"Seriously, I'm going to be a whore?" Suriya stammered. Grace sat next to her and put her arm around her shoulders.</p>
<p>"Think about it, you are an attractive woman who doesn't know how fucking sexy she is. There's no greater way to confirm your sexiness than to have men paying to fuck you. We'll be creating you an anonymous profile on a website people use to find women so sexy that they have no choice but to pay to fuck them. We'll even tell you the obscene amount of money men have paid just to get their hands on your body." Grace explained, tracing her hand up and down Suriya's arm as she did. Suriya let out a sigh, her shoulders dropped, and suddenly she was much more comfortable with the plan ahead of her.</p>
<p>"Alright, what now?" Suriya asked with a smile.</p>
<p>"Well I'm going to be leaving you in Malcolm and Grace's capable hands for the next 2 days while I get to work rounding up and vetting the men who will be paying to have sex with you." Badiha explained. She couldn't tell them that being around Malcom while he trained someone was hazardous to her humanity. Badiha bid her goodbyes and left the room as she heard Malcolm begin to discuss her makeover, a process Badiha and Grace had been jokingly referring to as the opposite of the movie Pretty Women.</p>
<p>Badiha thought that just working on Suriya's profile would be enough distance, but as the photos from her training began to get sent across and Badiha began to have chat's with prospective clients, she realised her role was just as sexually charged.</p>
<p>Badiha studied the photo Malcolm said would make a good profile pic, in it Suriya was transformed. They had bleached her hair so it was now an unnatural blonde, Badiha hoped that it would look the same when dyed back to dark brown at the end of the week. Her body was clearly as toned as she had intimated on her emails, firm for a woman in her thirties, but now Grace and Malcolm had subtly oiled it so her skin shone like dark amber.</p>
<p>She was kneeling on the bed in blue lace mesh lingerie with matching mask, perfectly working with her darker complexion. The lingerie was clearly more expensive than average, it was also see-through enough to see the shadow of nipples and the landing strip Malcolm had left behind when he had shaved her pussy. The bra was barely there, but still managed to offer flattering support to Suriya's previously downplayed D-cups. Everything about the arrangement screamed expensive prostitute, he'd even moved the bed next to the window so the run down hotel room wouldn't take away from the class (which made Badiha wonder if anyone on the street had seen her display.)</p>
<p>The moment the profile went up, with availability by the conference centre and airport for the next few days Badiha found herself having salacious conversations with at least a dozen men, which did nothing to tamp down her desires as Malcolm began to send teasing shots and nude selfies that he assured Badiha would work wonders on those one to one chats that were setting up the jobs. In each one Suriya had a big grin under her mask.</p>
<p>Badiha found herself in a virtual world of eroticism, talking dirty online to hungry men, proposing sexual fantasies, and watching as her dark mind was indulged. It didn't help when Malcolm sent over a photo of Suriya arm in arm with Grace, both naked and giggling, and it became clear that Grace was availing herself of Malcolm's training as well.</p>
<p>After two days Badiha couldn't help but be excited to return to the hotel and check in on progress.</p>
<p>"So we have your first client today, an accountant called Derek. He's a sweetie and a bit vanilla, perfect for your first time. He has no connections to your day to day life so I figure you won't need the mask for this encounter. We know there are hazards to this profession so have hidden cameras and will dive in if your clients go too far." Badiha explained.</p>
<p>"Thank you." Suriya replied with a pleasant grin. "Malcolm told me what to expect and I think I can handle a lot of it."</p>
<p>"Alright, well if you can't handle it, use the phrase 'sorry that's too far' and we'll come in if they don't back off. If they ask why we're there we can just say your phone has that as an activation phrase to call for help so we don't expose the cameras." Badiha calmly informed as Suriya took the opportunity to start getting dressed, no longer ashamed of being naked in front of company.</p>
<p>"Suriya, if this guy is as vanilla as Badiha says, wear the green dress over some lingerie and let him have fun taking it off." Malcolm advised knowledgeably.</p>
<p>"Thanks Malcolm" said Suriya, confusing Badiha with the familiar and non-subjugated tone she was using with the man who trained her. Malcolm, Grace, and Badiha left and went to a room down the hall they had booked to be close by so Suriya had a moment to be alone with her thoughts and excitement.</p>
<p>"So how was her training?" Badiha casually asked as she booted up her computer and connected it to the hidden cameras.</p>
<p>"My god she has the most strangely inconsistent confidence. We had to spend most of the time reassuring her that she was sexy, giving her confidence that people would enjoy her company, teaching her tricks to make sure nobody would think she wasn't sexy. Then the moment the guy at the takeaway gets our order wrong you'd think she was about to burn down the shop." Malcolm explained.</p>
<p>"And I see Grace took a hands-on approach to helping out."</p>
<p>"Grace played her part beautifully, she helped with training but every so often when Suriya's nerve failed her Grace would step in to hold her hand and try things with her." Grace blushed as Malcolm sang her praises, while Badiha remembered a time she was willing to do far worse for even a hint of his approval.</p>
<p>"I think the key is..." Grace began before Badiha interrupted her.</p>
<p>"Hang on, it looks like Derek's just arrived." Indeed a middle-aged man in a suit was awkwardly making his way down the corridor, studying door numbers until he got to door 11 and froze. He straightened up and did his best to look calm and confident before giving the door a quiet knock.</p>
<p>Inside the room Suriya looked equally nervous, though in her dazzling green dress with high slit and oodles of cleavage she certainly had nothing to be nervous about. She took a deep breath and answered the door.</p>
<p>They both froze, looking at each other over the threshold, he was stunned silent by the vision of beauty that was in front of him, she was stunned by the picture of mediocrity she had agreed to fuck for money. Eventually she regained her nerve and broke the silence.</p>
<p>"So do you want to come in or were you planning on having this party in the hallway?" She asked as seductively as her nerves would allow. Despite her intervention, Derek still remained in stunned silence, so taking the initiative she grabbed his tie and pulled him over the threshold and into her arms, her lips planting themselves on his. She used her leg to close the door behind him, and in her embrace he relaxed and began to trace her back with his hands.</p>
<p>Derek was fumbling and hectic trying to get Suriya's dress off, so Suriya stopped him, calmed him down, then salaciously turned and lifted her hair out of the way so he could unzip her and watch the green dress flutter to the ground. The sight of Suriya in her lingerie was overwhelming and he immediately tackled her onto the bed.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>"Aren't you excitable?" Suriya cooed as Derek began kissing every inch of body he could find.</p>
<p>"Sorry but you're even more sexy in person." Derek replied between kisses. Eventually Suriya managed to turn him over and start undoing his trousers to liberate his hard cock from a fabric tent it was about to burst out of.</p>
<p>Badiha watched the show unfolding on the camera and once again had to hide the joy she felt seeing the fruits of her labour. Grace and Malcolm were right next to her so she couldn't reveal how wet she was to see Suriya wrap her lips around Derek's cock. She had been talking to Derek for the last couple of days, working him into a lather, building the sexual frustration that Suriya was now releasing. A small part of her was screaming that it should be her seductively handing him a condom and licking her lips with anticipation.</p>
<p>"They're not all going to be this vanilla are they?" Grace asked.</p>
<p>"Not everyone is like us, for her this is already pretty extreme." Badiha replied. Grace dwelled on 'like us' a bit longer than Badiha was comfortable with, but she knew it was inevitable that she'd have to tell Grace the depths of her perversion soon.</p>
<p>"Yeah the prostitution is hot, but it's just going to be one guy after another having normal sex?" Grace asked as Suriya straddled Derek and slowly lowered herself onto his cock, moaning with delight at cheating on her husband for the first time.</p>
<p>"It escalates, she wanted two to five people, at least one of them a woman, we're going to give her that one at a time throughout the week, then just as she thinks that's the whole experience we give her the grand finale. Plus there's the appointment she has after this." Badiha explained, gradually getting louder to speak over the orgasmic moans coming from her computer speakers and through the wall.</p>
<p>Derek gripped Suriya's thighs as he spurted inside of her. Suriya pulled herself off his cock and snuggled next to him for a moment before Derek panicked, cleaning up, getting changed, and leaving a stack of notes on the counter as he rushed out of the room.</p>
<p>Suriya was a bit confused about Badiha and the gang ushering her out of the room for a vaguely defined appointment. It was only when they arrived at a nearby tattoo parlor that she remembered asking for her body to be marked. She was a bit disappointed to just be given a tattoo but when Badiha explained further she found herself getting more excited.</p>
<p>"Today you are going to get a small black flower outline tattooed on your hip. That flower will be Derek's flower. Every time you sell your body, we will come here with your fee to add another flower to the pattern. To anyone looking it will look like a fairly commonplace flower pattern, but to you each flower will remind you of a time you sold your body."</p>
<p>Suriya removed the skirt she had come out in and lowered the waistband of her knickers before sitting down in the chair and shuddering as the buzz of the tattoo needle echoed through the room.</p>
<p>The next day Suriya was eager to see who would be providing her second flower, her first flower was small enough that it could be covered by a large band aid while it healed and barely hurt as much as Suriya thought it would. Badiha informed her that she had one client booked for the early afternoon and a second for the evening, she would then have a day off before having two more sessions with clients.</p>
<p>Her first client was a strange situation, she was due to give the keynote speech at an actuarial conference and had pre-speech jitters. Jitters which she found went away if she hired a prostitute and dominated her for an hour.</p>
<p>A mousy woman with thick glasses knocked on the door, almost dropping her pull along suitcase as she did. Suriya opened the door and smiled warmly as she welcomed in her latest client.</p>
<p>The woman mumbled that she wanted to use the bathroom, before locking herself in and leaving Suriya confused. It was a bit of time before the door was flung open and the formally meek woman stood transformed in a latex corset, trousers, gloves, and boots. She flexed a riding crop in her hands before pointing it at Suriya.</p>
<p>"Why is my whore still wearing clothes?" She boomed as Suriya immediately reacted by stripping down.</p>
<p>"Now it's getting interesting,'' Grace giggled as she watched over the camera.</p>
<p>"Your filthy bathroom left a smudge on my pristine boot, I hope your tongue is up to the job of getting it off." She yelled. Suriya got down on her knees, bent over and began licking the woman's outstretched boot, as she did so her new mistress began lightly swatting at her bare bottom. "Alright slave, knees apart, hands behind your head, let's see what I'm working with."</p>
<p>Suriya obeyed each barked command, then kneeled quietly as her new mistress inspected her.</p>
<p>"Hmm, nice body, good tits." She noted, out of nowhere she swatted Suriya's left breast with her crop and noted her response. "Strong wince from a mild swat, you're not a pain whore are you?"</p>
<p>"Not really, no." Suriya responded, only to receive another swat across her breasts.</p>
<p>"The correct response was 'no mistress'. Let's try again. You're not a pain whore are you?"</p>
<p>"No mistress." Suriya replied.</p>
<p>"Have you ever licked cunt before?"</p>
<p>"Yes mistress." Suriya replied, not revealing her first time was two days ago while training with Grace</p>
<p>"Well then I expect results." The dominatrix responded, unzipping a long zipper that ran between the legs of her latex trousers, freeing her pussy. She stepped forward and forcefully thrust Suriya into her crotch, giggling at her new slave having to quickly adapt to her new reality and start lapping at her mistress.</p>
<p>"We should get her on retainer." Grace joked.</p>
<p>"Keep an eye on the actuarial conferences and you can take Suriya's place next time." Badiha replied, voicing what had been swirling through her head anyway.</p>
<p>"Urgh, you are rubbish with a pussy." The dominatrix cursed, pushing Suriya away. She rummaged through her suitcase and pulled out a gag with a dildo sticking out from the ball designed to be bitten into by the slave. "Put this on, I want to fuck your face and your tongue is clearly not up to the job."</p>
<p>Badiha felt a tingle of masochistic empathy but quickly suppressed it as the dominatrix watched Suriya strap on the gag and at her mistress' bidding lay down on her back with the dildo sticking up in the air. The woman turned around and backed herself up over Suriya's body before easing the dildo inside her pussy. She then began to bounce on Suriya's face, occasionally slowing to plunge the dildo deep inside of her and smother Suriya between her cheeks. As she began to moan and writhe, the riding crop which had not left her hands began to swat as Suriya's tits and cunt.</p>
<p>Eventually she screamed and shuddered as with one final thrust she plunged the dildo into herself, gripping Suriya's tits tight in her hands as her body was wracked by an almighty orgasm. She climbed off Suriya and removed the gag.</p>
<p>"Very good slave, now wait outside while I get redressed." She gasped. Suriya hesitated but could see her client was not joking and left her hotel room.</p>
<p>Badiha, Grace, and Malcolm kept a close eye on the corridors, ready to spring into action if anyone was coming in the direction of Suriya as she stood outside her room, naked and glowing with riding crop marks. Eventually her dominatrix hurriedly left her hotel room, redressed in her unassuming day to day clothes and mumbling something about cash on the bedside table.</p>
<p>As they left the tattoo parlor with a new flower on Suriya's hip, her only question was who her next client was.</p>
<p>"Well this client wants the full experience of sleeping with a prostitute." Badiha awkwardly explained.</p>
<p>"Don't they all?" Suriya asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, but this one may be a bit more awkward."</p>
<p>Suriya looked out into the street wondering how it had come to this. She was standing on a road that was not a major road, but still busy enough that cars would often drive by to see the state that she was in. Her makeup and clothes had been specifically chosen so there was no doubt that she was a prostitute walking the streets. She was wearing a tight strapless red dress that only covered from the edge of her cleavage to the tops of her thighs, with platform heels ensuring her exposed legs were kept alluringly toned. Her matching red thong barely covering anything whenever she bent over to talk into someone's car window.</p>
<p>To ensure she was safe, she was flanked either side by Badiha and Grace, also in street walkers outfits to blend in. Badiha had decided on a fishnet top over a bright pink bra, a black skirt that was practically a belt, offering plenty of flashes of her matching pink knickers, and fishnet stockings that ran down to her open toe stiletto heels. Grace was wearing a tight green tube top with denim short shorts that let everyone see an unobstructed view of the curves of her bottom, and platform heeled boots to keep them firm.</p>
<p>Badiha wished the client wouldn't take so long, although she wondered if he was watching the show as part of what he was paying for. So far three other cars had stopped and asked how much, only to be turned away by the high price they had picked to deter outsiders. Just in case men didn't take no for an answer, they each had a taser in their purses alongside the condoms, lube and other supplies.</p>
<p>Eventually a car pulled up that Badiha recognised from the client's description. She double checked the license plate and there was no doubt this was the man Suriya was put here to meet.</p>
<p>"This is the guy Suriya." Badiha whispered, pushing Suriya front and centre to alluringly lean into his car and ask if he wanted a ride. After a bit of small talk, Suriya climbed inside and Badiha let a sigh of relief leave her mouth as the car drove away.</p>
<p>"Alright, now we can head back and get out of these clothes." Badiha sighed.</p>
<p>"Actually, I was quite enjoying the attention I was getting in this outfit. I was going to walk to supermarket and buy us some snacks, drink in the looks as I go." Grace admitted.</p>
<p>"I don't want to do that." Badiha lied.</p>
<p>"You don't have to, you can just head back."</p>
<p>"I'm not leaving you alone like this."</p>
<p>"You once sent me out on my own wearing nothing but cookie dough ice cream." Grace laughed.</p>
<p>"On a street I knew, to a shop I was familiar with. We don't know what will happen here." Badiha warned, but she could see that look in Grace's eyes that said this was the unique kind of bad idea that wasn't going to be shaken by petty things like logic.</p>
<p>"If anything goes wrong I have this taser. I'll meet you back at the hotel." Grace defiantly stated as she stormed off, leaving Badiha on the street corner with her head in her hands.</p>
<p>Badiha didn't know why she had to pretend to be so proper in front of Grace. She still saw sexual humiliation as a form of weakness and some vestigial ego told her she needed to look strong for her new employee. But she could feel that her pride had deprived her of a fun time showing off her body at the supermarket. She knew it was dangerous to go back to indulging this bad side of her, but everything about this niche she had carved for herself had been feeding the mental beast that had been awakened on that isolated Scottish island.</p>
<p>"You looking for a party?" A voice came over the sound of a resting engine, breaking through Badiha's contemplation. It took Badiha a second to realise the man had pulled his car over to talk to her as she was still stood on a street corner wearing the clothes and makeup of a prostitute. At first she considered turning him down flat but decided to have a little fun before pricing herself out of his league. She seductively leaned over his open window and giggled.</p>
<p>"What sort of party you have in mind?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"Honestly, I haven't got long between shifts. But work is stressful and I could use a quick fuck on the back seat of my car before I head back." He explained. Badiha eyed his car up and down as she prepared to drop the bomb to put an end to this, but for some reason her mouth engaged before her brain could have any say in the matter.</p>
<p>"Party like that will be £50"</p>
<p>"Wow, what a bargain. Hop in." The guy replied while Badiha's eyes grew wide to what she had just arranged to do. She glanced around and couldn't see anyone, so she strutted around the car and got into the back seat. The man began to drive, snaking deep into suburbia, his eyes occasionally glancing at Badiha's body, making her feel a strange pride at how distracting her overt sexuality was. Her mind now committed to what was about to happen, she decided it would be fun to strip off what meager fabrics were covering her body. Naked and on the back seat of a stranger's car, she began to lightly play with herself and the man ended up almost slamming into a tree.</p>
<p>Eventually the man found a mostly empty cul-de-sac full of sleepy terrace houses. Badiha found herself embracing him and helping him climb into the back seat, his frustration at her show on the back seat clearly boiling over into rabid lust as his hands grabbed and squeezed whatever they could find.</p>
<p>While he began to clumsily rub Badiha's pussy, she busied herself freeing his cock from his trousers. She tried to shuffle down to wrap her lips around his hard dick but was rebuffed.</p>
<p>"I don't think I could last a blow job, and I really want to fuck you in the pussy." He explained.</p>
<p>"I'm flattered, so how do you want me?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"You're really up for anything aren't you?" He noticed as Badiha squirmed and nodded. "Alright, I want to fuck you doggy style, with half your body out the window."</p>
<p>Now it was time for Badiha's sensible thoughts to take a back seat, her brain was screaming that it put her in danger of exposure and even arrest but all complaints were in vain as she handed her customer a condom before rolling down the window and pushing herself through until her face and torso were caressed by the night air.</p>
<p>Badiha felt goosebumps cover her skin from the exposure, she glanced down to see her tits hanging beneath her, swaying with the shuffling adjustments to her position. Then she felt the man's hard cock pressing itself against her wet pussy. She reached back with one hand to help guide him in and check he'd put the condom on like he said, then returned to pushing herself up against the outside of the car as her body began to sway with his thrusts.</p>
<p>A moan escaped her mouth and Badiha quickly swallowed it, but as she did so she noticed a light come on in the house across the street.</p>
<p>'No,' she thought to herself as she saw the curtain twitch, then get pulled open as a middle aged man looked out from his house to watch her hooker tits sway with the pounding she was getting inside the car.</p>
<p>'No, no, no." She thought to herself as she saw a grin cross his face. He then reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone.</p>
<p>"Fuck." She said out loud, although her client just thought it was a groan of ecstacy from his performance. Badiha looked straight into the camera and felt a wellspring of humiliation as her whoring was being filmed, she even noticed the man had begun to touch himself down his trousers while he was filming.</p>
<p>'For a man who claimed he wouldn't last long to a blow job, he seems to be taking forever cum in my pussy' Badiha thought to herself as her humiliation seemed to continue far longer than was comfortable. She felt herself climaxing at the humiliation, waves of pleasure swirling around her warm pounded pussy and cold swaying tits.</p>
<p>Badiha found herself beginning to ham up her orgasmic bliss, for the benefit of her client and her cameraman. Her moans echoed down the street and she could have sworn she saw a few more lights turn on, but she didn't have time for that as she felt her clients knees buck and he surged inside of her. He pulled her back inside the car.</p>
<p>"You realise you probably woke up the whole street with your big mouth." He chastised through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry." Badiha replied, instantly falling back into her sexual slave persona.</p>
<p>"Well we better get the fuck out of here before someone calls the police." He said as he climbed into the front of the car and started up the engine and quickly pulled away.</p>
<p>Badiha began to redress on the back seat as the man made a beeline back to where he had picked her up. They arrived back at that street corner and the moment the car had stopped the man was thrusting some cash at Badiha, hurriedly trying to get her out of his car.</p>
<p>"Sorry again for waking the street with my whore moaning. Please take this as an apology." She stated, handing him her knickers before getting out of the car. His rush to get out of the situation was forgotten as he watched Badiha walk away from the car, her tiny dress completely ill-equipped to maintain modesty while its owner was commando.</p>
<p>Badiha was relieved to get back to the hotel before Grace or Suriya and change. Suriya was not far behind, having been taken back to her John's hotel room for sex that was 'rough but not too far'. Grace was much further behind, her trip to the shop had been derailed by her runaway lebido, like Badiha she returned with parts of her outfit traded away to strangers for petty reasons.</p>
<p>Badiha had the tattoo artist on call so even though it was late at night she was still able to get Suriya to the parlor to get a new flower for her hip. Suriya seemed to have a perverted pride at the trio of flowers blooming from her perversion. As the group agreed to head back to the hotel, Badiha hung back to chat with the tattoo artist. She waited until they were out of the door before quietly making her request.</p>
<p>"Could... could I also have a flower tattooed on my hip."</p>
<p>"So, are you feeling sexy?" Badiha asked, trying to psych Suriya up as she squirmed sat on the bed. She was being told to keep her mask on, had a heap of makeup with fake contouring to disguise the shape of her face, and even her tattoos had been covered with a heavy layer of thick foundation. This was going her with a low level dread about what client would be coming next as they clearly didn't want them to recognise her.</p>
<p>"I feel sexy, but..."</p>
<p>"You do have a sexy butt." Grace interrupted.</p>
<p>"Trust me, this client will banish any lingering doubts that you are a total smoke show." Badiha assured. "Just act natural and don't forget we will come rescue you if you tell him to stop and he doesn't."</p>
<p>The gang cleared out of the room and into their makeshift surveillance setup next door as Suriya nervously fiddled with the draping lace of her lingerie. She jumped a little when she heard the knock on the door, before collecting herself, straightening up her mask, and going to answer.</p>
<p>The first thing Suriya noticed was the navy blue suit, it struck her as interesting as her husband had one just like it. A split second later she saw a face that was also just like her husband's, staring at her with erotic contempt.</p>
<p>"Hi..." she began but was immediately cut-off.</p>
<p>"Shut up whore." Her husband replied, pushing her into the room and closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>Suriya was stunned silent as he began to roughly tear away her lingerie, aggressively claiming her body as his. He undid his trousers and pushed Suriya down onto her knees, forcing his cock into her mouth and laughing at her gagging chokes. Occasionally if she choked particularly hard he would pull her by the hair off his dick, but only to give her face some light slaps before grabbing the back of her head and forcing her into a blowjob again.</p>
<p>This was not the same caring loving man she had married. This wasn't the man who didn't tell Suriya he was terrified of roller coasters until after they were married, despite two of their first three dates being at theme parks. This was a man treating Suriya like she simply didn't matter, when she was used to a man putting her first at every turn.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"Alright whore, your constant gagging is annoying me. Bend over." He coldly ordered. Suriya did as she was told and gingerly touched her toes. As she was doing so, with practiced efficiency her husband rolled a condom onto his dick, she then felt her husband's cock begin to press against her anus.</p>
<p>"Hey..." She began only to be cut off by some fierce swats to her bottom.</p>
<p>"You have a tight ass for a whore. I'm going to have to add lube to this condom."</p>
<p>"Couldn't you just..." Suriya once again began only to be silenced by another round of angry spanks.</p>
<p>"Didn't pay for your whore mouth to flap at me. If you were about to ask me to fuck your diseased cunt, the answer is I only touch one vagina when I am making love to my wife. When I fuck whores I fuck them up the ass." He informed while smearing lubricant over his cock. Suriya fell silent as she felt his slippery hard penis insistently push past the hot pressure of resistance and into her vulnerable ass.</p>
<p>Suriya had not had a lot of anal training in the couple of days she had spent with Malcolm and Grace, so it was painful when her husband began thrusting into her as hard as he could. He grabbed her hair with his hand and pulled her head back to give himself more purchase on her body, slamming his cock deep inside of her with every thrust. It didn't take long before he thrust deep inside of her and she felt his cock surging inside the condom.</p>
<p>After a few moments of orgasm, her husband returned to being Jekyll, leaving Hyde behind as a memory.</p>
<p>"Thank you. Sorry if I hurt you." He apologised as he gathered up his things. Suriya was stunned silent and could see a small amount of concern wash over her husband's face before he took a deep breath, left some money on the counter, and left.</p>
<p>Badiha, Malcolm, and Grace waited until Suriya's husband turned the corner before rushing to the room to make sure they hadn't gone too far.</p>
<p>"How are you feeling?" Badiha asked, putting a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Mixed, I don't know if it's just my recent experiences that are clouding my judgment, but all I can focus on is that my husband does find me attractive. He loves me, he just needs to degrade women and can't bring himself to see me that way. Before today I would have worried about this side of him, but now all I can think is that I'll make him see that I can be his loving wife and degraded whore."</p>
<p>Badiha was more than familiar with this sexual haze that gets into a brain when put through her experiences. Right now every thought Suriya was having was going through the filter of sex, Badiha made a mental note to help her adapt back to the non-sex world after such an experience, the moment she figured out how to do it herself.</p>
<p>"Now she's getting it." Grace cheered.</p>
<p>That evening at the tattoo parlor, Suriya specifically requested that the newest flower be a blooming rose, larger than its surrounding flowers.</p>
<p>"Urgh, this is not coming together as I had planned." Badiha sighed as she closed another chat tab on her computer.</p>
<p>"Still no takers?" Malcolm calmly asked.</p>
<p>"We were supposed to end the week on a gang bang of the makeup Suriya had originally described. A bait and switch where at first she thought we were being creative with her request and then she finds out it was all warmup for literally fulfilling it."</p>
<p>"Not a lot of people want to pay to be part of group sex. If you're shelling out money you want a rental car not public transport." Malcolm sagely observed.</p>
<p>"We picked this location mainly because Suriya's husband was due to be at a conference. I just didn't realise how transient and flakey it made everyone organising a prostitute." Badiha acknowledged. Grace returned to the room with the pizza they had ordered and immediately sensed the vibes in the room.</p>
<p>"No joy getting up to 5 people, at least one a woman?" Grace asked.</p>
<p>"The councillor backed out so we're back to square one." Badiha groaned.</p>
<p>"Couldn't we make it five with who we have to hand?" Grace asked. "Me, Malcolm, the tattoo artist, the guy at the front desk and..."</p>
<p>"And me?' Badiha replied. Grace was suggesting this even though she didn't know the kind of person Badiha was showed how skewed her worldview was becoming. It didn't matter that she was right about everything Badiha couldn't let her know. "I'm not doing it."</p>
<p>Malcolm looked confused but was able to smother it before Grace noticed.</p>
<p>"Maybe the four of us would be enough, she did say 'two to five people', four is a number between two and five." He noted.</p>
<p>"Alright, I'll go ask the tattoo artist and the guy behind the counter if they would be interested." Badiha conceded, grabbing a slice of pizza as she headed out of the door.</p>
<p>She walked past Suriya's door, wondering what was going through her mind as she quietly got on with some work, played with her phone, rubbed lotion into the ever growing tattoo, all while waiting for the conclusion of her brief stint as a whore.</p>
<p>She knew at some point she would have to come clean with Grace about the events on the island and the depths of depravity it had planted deep in her subconscious. She knew Grace wouldn't judge, if anything she would be happy to see this side of Badiha, but her stupid ego couldn't bring itself to admit how much she was defeated. The only argument her mind seemed to countenance was that if she didn't tell Grace, at some point she would find out, this line of work availed Badiha of too many opportunities for deviancy, and she hardly had a 100% success rate at rising above it.</p>
<p>As she approached the front desk she heard the voice a man pleading with the receptionist, echoing down the halls.</p>
<p>"I just need to know if I knock on number 11 I'll get the same woman I met yesterday." The familiar voice wined.</p>
<p>"...and I told you I can't divulge that information, our guest details are strictly private." The receptionist curtly replied, clearly practiced in having this conversation.</p>
<p>"It's just... she seemed so..." the man fumbled. As Badiha turned the corner she saw Suriya's husband, her eyes widened and she feared for the worst. "I don't know her name, just the room number. I only want to apologise."</p>
<p>Content that Suriya's identity was safe, Badiha breathed a sigh of relief and joined the queue behind Suriya's husband. After increasingly meek pleadings with the receptionist, he turned around and clocked Badiha.</p>
<p>"Maybe you knew her, Asian woman in room 11."</p>
<p>"Sir, please don't harass our guests." The receptionist sternly asked.</p>
<p>"Don't worry Brett, I'll take care of this." Badiha replied, linking arms with Suriya's husband and pulling him outside and out of earshot. "Yeah, I know the woman in 11, she was a newbie, still getting to grips with the work. I'm afraid she left yesterday."</p>
<p>"Oh cripes." Suriya's husband gasped. Badiha saw that he felt guilty that his rough treatment had gotten to Suriya and she needed to counter it.</p>
<p>"Oh, you must have been her last client. Don't worry it's not your fault. She just realised she was braver in theory than in practice." Badiha reassured.</p>
<p>"She did say she could handle it rough."</p>
<p>"Common mistake among girls just starting out." Badiha agreed, patting his arm. Her worst impulses once again played a trick they had recently learned, that they didn't need to win an argument with the rational part of her brain, just get her to say something without thinking that she couldn't take back. "For £50 you can be as rough as you want with me."</p>
<p>Suriya's husband's face went from concern to arousal so fast it made Badiha's stomach drop. With those words she had released the beast, with no way to reverse the direction this was going in. He unhooked his arm from hers and looked her up and down, a sneer crawling across his face.</p>
<p>"I didn't realise you were also a filthy whore." He snarled. He got out his wallet and threw some notes at Badiha, laughing as she recoiled, then bent over to pick them up. "So do you have a room here?"</p>
<p>"No, but there's no CCTV in the alleyway behind." Badiha responded.</p>
<p>"Alright, I'm going to fuck you by the bins like the piece of garbage you are." He stated, grabbing Badiha's hair and dragging her out of sight.</p>
<p>They got to the alleyway behind the hotel and Badiha was relieved that it was empty. Suriya's husband pushed her up against the bins, taking a kiss for himself while his hands remained around her neck.</p>
<p>"Alright slut, take off your clothes and throw them in the bin." He ordered, his malice encouraged by the smile that crossed Badiha's face. She didn't hesitate, quickly peeling off the professional outfit and leaving it in a pile in front of her. Once she stood naked in front of Suriya's husband she turned around to let him watch as she dropped the whole bundle of clothes in the dumpster. She didn't have time to turn back around before she felt one arm pushing her to lean forward, then bursts of heat on her bottom as he began spanking her ass without mercy.</p>
<p>"This is what you get for being a filthy whore." He yelled as Badiha moaned with delight.</p>
<p>"Thank you master, I deserve this." She replied between slaps. In shock he turned her around, hands on her throat so he could see the wild look in her eyes.</p>
<p>"You're actually enjoying this." He noticed.</p>
<p>"Maybe." Badiha coyly responded. "How about you slap my slutty tits around and see the look on my face?"</p>
<p>Suriya's husband took her instruction to heart and began giving her breasts some hard swats, enjoying Badiha's moans of agony and ecstasy each time his hand connected. He grabbed both of her nipples between his thumb and forefinger and pulled her towards him to take another kiss for himself.</p>
<p>"You are the most fucked up whore I've every delt with." He announced, pulling away from the kiss but keeping her nipples in his pinch.</p>
<p>"Thank you master." Badiha hungrily replied, explosions of erotic pain rising from her nipples as he twisted them in his hands. "Does that mean you're going to fuck me now?"</p>
<p>"Bend over bitch, I'm going to bury my cock in your ass." He announced. Badiha obeyed and turned around as Suriya's husband got a condom out of his wallet. Soon she felt that familiar hot pressure of an erect cock pushing at her sphincter and she relaxed and let him in. Immediately he pulled Badiha upwards by her hair and thrust forward so Badiha was pushed halfway into the dumpster, her tits swaying above the disgusting mess of bin bags her clothes had been mixed in with. Her legs were still pinned between his legs and the outside of the dumpster so she stayed upright and continued to feel him thrusting deep within her, albeit as she fought to keep her top half from collapsing into the bin.</p>
<p>It has been a while since Badiha was last fucked in her ass so violently, she had missed the overwhelming sense of violation and found her body surrendering to the pleasure as she felt Suriya's husband finish himself off with some powerful final thrusts deep inside of her. She was weak at the knees and gathering her wits when she felt him cruelly withdraw without warning. Next she felt his arms wrapping around her upper thighs, before she could process what was happening she felt her body lifting up and tumbling unceremoniously into the bin.</p>
<p>"That's where filthy whores like you belong." He giggled, peeling the used condom off his cock, tossing it onto Badiha's body, and leaving.</p>
<p>"Thank you sir." Badiha meekly called out after him, taking a moment to lie on top of the pile of trash before getting to work rummaging through it to find her clothes.</p>
<p>Badiha went to a nearby gym just to have a thorough shower without Grace and Malcolm knowing, then headed onto the tattoo parlour with two questions in mind. Would the artist be interested in an orgy and could he tattoo a second flower on Badiha's hip?</p>
<p>After being such an impressive whore for Suriya's husband, Badiha struggled to look Suriya in the eye, let alone join in an orgy. She struck lucky when she found out the tattoo artist and his girlfriend were swingers, both willing to take part in the final orgy while she sat things out. She sat in the other room, watching the erotic world revolving around Suriya as each participant took out their deviant desires on her body, lamenting that both her pride and her shame kept her from being right in the middle of the action.</p>
<p>As she sat alone, the crackly speakers filling the room with orgasmic moans of group sex being recorded next door. Badiha grabbed her phone and dropped Nicole a text, hoping her fellow slave girl from the island was doing better than her at adjusting to the real world and if so hoping she had tips on how to do that.</p>
<p>Her bags were already packed and she was looking forward to leaving the moment Suriya's fantasy was done. Luckily for her the tattoo artist has bought his kit and was planning on adding five more flowers to Suriya's collection the moment he was done spit roasting her with the help of his girlfriend and a strap-on.</p>
<p>The moment Badiha and Grace returned to Badiha's apartment, they opened a bottle of wine to toast the success of their latest client</p>
<p>"So..." Grace nonchalantly began as Badiha sat in her lounge on her laptop. "Would you say I passed my probation?"</p>
<p>"You did really well with Suriya, so yes. This role just became full time. If you need my help finding a good apartment for fairly cheap, I know a landlord who still owes me for sourcing her body weight in Adderall the week before her exams." Badiha planned, happy to be getting Grace out of her house.</p>
<p>"I won't be needing that. I'll be needing what we agreed, an explanation of why you want to take 'a step back' from all of this." Grace stated, sitting as close to Badiha as she could on the sofa.</p>
<p>"That's not going to happen any more, I've accepted I'm locked in." Badiha replied, draining the glass of wine in front of her and pouring another one. Tonight was going to be the night she ripped off the band aid and took Grace into her confidence. "Alright, let me show you something."</p>
<p>Badiha stood up and lowered the hem on her trousers and knickers, so the black outline tattoos of two flowers could be seen by her protégé. Grace smiled, then looked confused, then smiled even wider.</p>
<p>"Are those..."</p>
<p>"Yes." Badiha cut Grace off. "Both from our time in Birmingham. This one on the left was a man who picked me up off the street after you went shopping, this one on the right is from Suriya's husband the day after he'd had a go with Suriya."</p>
<p>"Holy shit. You're fucking bonkers, but you hid it so well..." Grace marveled before rushing over to the fridge to get out another bottle of wine. "Spare no details, I want to know everything."</p>
<p>So Badiha told her everything.</p>
<p>"... Then he tossed me into the bin, like a disposable whore."</p>
<p>"You did so much to pre-vet Henrietta's bin then let yourself just be tossed in one outside a hotel?" Grace interrupted for the hundredth time.</p>
<p>"Yeah I got lucky there was nothing dangerous in there. He tossed his condom onto my body and I lay there for some time feeling his cum trickling out onto me. And I guess that brings us up to now."</p>
<p>"So I got out of the starting gate early, but I've got nothing on you. You don't suppose you could organise for me to have an island training session with Malcolm?" Grace laughed.</p>
<p>"It was pretty expensive, maybe for your birthday." Badiha joked. "At first I didn't want to lose myself, it was so difficult to claw myself back to being functional after totally surrending my psyche to erotic subjugation I felt it would be better to walk away from everything. Now I feel that this is simply a perk of my power, like skimming some cash off the top of a healthy account, I get to indulge myself, dip my toe in, during our little escapades."</p>
<p>"And now you have a confidant, I can help you go further while also looking out for you going too far." Grace reassured.</p>
<p>"Thanks Grace, that means a lot to me." Badiha gave her new partner in crime a hug while choking back her tears. "It's probably for the best that we've run out of wine."</p>
<p>"Yeah, it means I can send you to the shop to get more." Grace replied with a wicked grin. Badiha gave her a confused look. "Come on, you don't expect me to learn all this about you and not take it for a test drive."</p>
<p>"I'm sure I don't know what you mean." Badiha said cheekily, her heart beginning to pump faster at the thought of the dark desires Grace was cooking up for her.</p>
<p>"I mean you're going to go to the shop to get us some more wine and I'm choosing your outfit." Grace chirped. She skipped out of the room while Badiha dutifully began to strip down, her naked body ready to be a blank canvas for Grace's debauched plans.</p>
<p>Grace returned and gave Badiha a proud grin as she presented a tea towel and two clothes pegs. She draped the tea towel against Badiha's body, it was only just wide enough to cover her nipples and only just long enough to cover her pussy. Grace then secured it in place by pegging the corners to her nipples.</p>
<p>"Alright, looks like you're ready to go." Grace giggled, dragging Badiha towards the door thrusting some cash into her hand. Badiha looked out into the corridor leading to the lifts with a tingle in her stomach at what lay ahead. Grace gave her a hearty swat on her bottom so she jumped out of her door and heard it close behind her. Badiha took a couple tentative steps towards lift when she heard her apartment door open again.</p>
<p>"Wait!" Yelled Grace, running after her. As Grace caught up, she turned Badiha back around and used some lipstick to write on her back.</p>
<p>'please take photos and message them to 07*********'</p>
<p>"There we go, now I'm not unlocking the front door until you have bought the wine, and I photos of your ordeal taken by 5 different members of the public." Grace informed, turning round and retreating back into the apartment while Badiha got into the lift and pressed the button for the ground floor.</p>
<p>Grace got the first photo pretty soon after Badiha left the apartment, it was taken from a car driving past as Badiha walked into the night, her hands holding the corners of the tea towel to keep it from flapping in the breeze.</p>
<p>The second picture took a bit longer to arrive but eventually was sent to her, taken inside the shop as Badiha picked out some bottles of wine, the shopkeeper in the background simultaneously disinterested and disgusted by her behaviour.</p>
<p>The next person sent 2 pictures which made it clear that Badiha was now trying to get people to photograph her, both pictures were off the route to the shop and back. In the first she was stood next to some carrier bags of wine she had placed on the ground, lifting up the tea towel so her pussy was exposed. The second she had turned her back to the camera and was looking over her shoulder looking completely exposed.</p>
<p>The next message she received had a video attached, Grace opened it to see Badiha now near a park, some young men giggling as the camera trained on her. A hand stretched out from behind the camera and snatched the tea towel off of her. Badiha squealed in pain as the pegs dropped to the floor and blood flowed back to her nipples, the cameraman immediately ran away with the only covering Badiha had gone out in.</p>
<p>After some time worrying and thinking about going and helping her, Grace received messages from four people in quick succession, each covering a different angle of Badiha posing naked on a pool table inside a pub that was open late.</p>
<p>Badiha had a giant grin on her face when she buzzed at the door to be let back into her house.</p>
<p>Badiha woke up with the mother of all hangovers and vague memories of a night discussing the most perverted desires with Grace. It felt good not having to keep a secret, even if she strongly suspected that she was now on a far more dangerous path.</p>
<p>After she had made herself the largest strongest coffee she could muster, Badiha went to sit in her lounge, where Grace was already up and scanning through emails for their next job.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"Morning slut." Grace chirped. Badiha groaned in acknowledgement and went back to nursing her coffee. "So I've narrowed it down to two different jobs. I've got an army woman who wants to be dominated by a frat, good contact even if she clearly isn't familiar with universities, no uni in Britain has a frat."</p>
<p>"Don't think it's a good road to go down, you start judging our clients." Badiha gurgled</p>
<p>"Good point. I also got someone claiming to be Ariana Venti, big if true."</p>
<p>"Alright, which one do you want?" Badiha asked into her mug.</p>
<p>"That's the thing, I can't choose, they're both good prospects." Grace pled. Badiha didn't have it in her to be thinking through options right now. She certainly wasn't a fan of her phone's ringtone springing to life, practically piercing her brain.</p>
<p>"What person is this?" Badiha stammered as she answered the phone.</p>
<p>"It's Bella, are you Ok? I can call back another time..."</p>
<p>"No, no. It's fine. How can I help? Looking for another thrill?" Badiha asked, certain a repeat customer would probably be best for Grace's career growth.</p>
<p>"No thank you. My mother gave me resources to organise further entertainment without your intervention." Bella replied, keeping things vague. "The reason I'm calling is that I know you work with my mother, and I haven't seen her in a couple of days. Usually I wouldn't worry, she often gets sucked into her work, but I need her input on a work problem and she isn't in any of the places I would usually find her. You know where she is?"</p>
<p>"Sorry Bella. Information only flows one way in my working relationship with your mum. I don't know anything about what she's up to. But if I find anything out, I'll let you know." Badiha explained. Bella immediately hung up, not one for pleasantries even when her mother wasn't missing.</p>
<p>"Who was that?" Grace asked.</p>
<p>"Former client."</p>
<p>"Come on, you don't need to be tight lipped with me now I'm an employee."</p>
<p>"Fine, Bella Maximus." Badiha admitted.</p>
<p>"Holy shit Bella's a deviant? But she's the scariest person I know."</p>
<p>"You should meet her mother." Badiha quipped before leaving to go have a shower.</p>
<p>Badiha wrapped a towel around her hair and decided to wander her apartment naked to demonstrate that last night was not a one off. Grace appreciated the gesture but was still insistent on the point that Badiha needed to help her choose a client.</p>
<p>"Fine, how about we take one each. I'll help you with yours and you can help with mine but when the chips are down you have sole responsibility for one and I for the other." Badiha proposed.</p>
<p>"Good idea, nice chance to compare. I bet I'll do better at mine."</p>
<p>"We don't exactly hand out customer satisfaction surveys. How would you know you've done better?" Badiha sighed.</p>
<p>"You're missing the point, if we each take a client, we can strike a wager, have a little fun while we're at it." Grace joshed. Badiha thought this through and decided it was a good idea.</p>
<p>"Alright then. I think you need to learn restraint and I need to stick to my boundaries. So how about the wager be the first one to get involved with the adventure they set up for their client loses." Badiha suggested to Grace's approval.</p>
<p>"Deal, what's the punishment for the loser?"</p>
<p>"Difficult. It has to be something kinky, otherwise what's the point, but something so out there that we would want to avoid it." As Badiha was thinking aloud she was subconsciously grabbing her breasts, when she noticed it gave her an idea. "Implants! First to break has to go up to an E-cup.</p>
<p>"Holy shit... alright you're on." Grace enthusiastically agreed. "So who takes which client?"</p>
<p>"Flip a coin?" Badiha suggested.</p>
<p>Badiha had never prepared such an elaborate set of bluffs and misdirections just to meet with a client before. Her client was certainly wealthy enough to afford the incredible lengths of subterfuge she had planned.</p>
<p>On a flight from Monaco to Reykjavik, the private Jet of international music star Ariana Venti noticed some troubling warning lights appearing on their craft, forcing them to perform an emergency landing at an out of the way airport in the Midlands of the UK to receive emergency repairs. This meant there were no paparazzi prepared for when Ariana stepped off her plane and straight into a car, loaned to Badiha by a tight lipped friend who owed her a favour, and driven to a small cottage whose American owners gave Badiha a set of keys so long ago there's no way they would remember.</p>
<p>"You really go all out just to have a conversation." Ariana acknowledged as she sat down in the rustic dining room and helped herself to a bottle of sparkling water. She cut a different figure wearing some casual jogging trousers and sweatshirt for comfortable traveling, very different to the tight, cheeky, and deeply impractical outfits she was known for.</p>
<p>"Discretion doesn't stop when it becomes difficult. You are the most... public of my clients but I don't think it should prove a problem." Badiha calmly stated, continuing to sip from the coffee she had bought from Costa.</p>
<p>"So you're going to take on my fantasy?" Ariana asked, her eyes filling with hope.</p>
<p>"Indeed, in fact a lot of the arrangements have already been made. Everything left is just some things I need you onboard with. Firstly, I need you booked into the Royal Irwellside hotel after the final show of your UK tour, the one in Manchester."</p>
<p>"Done" Ariana replied, she had taken out her phone and was typing away as Badiha was talking.</p>
<p>"You are efficient. Alright, make sure you have the spa package booked for the next day."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't let just anyone do treatments on me..." Ariana began.</p>
<p>"Firstly they are the most expensive spa outside of London, but more importantly you're not going to be keeping that appointment anyway. You'll cancel on the day saying you are too hungover. Basically if you book a hotel for a night and a spa package for the morning after, it becomes unthinkable that you left the hotel in the intervening time. So when I sneak you out of the hotel in a dirty laundry box."</p>
<p>"Ew." Ariana interrupted.</p>
<p>"It won't actually have dirty laundry in it." Badiha sighed.</p>
<p>"Then drive you away in a hotel branded van, nobody will suspect you have left your room. We'll then change cars so I can drive you to a community theatre I have rented in Liverpool for a private event. This event has been advertised in the right circles as a late night fetish burlesque show, with 'special guest appearance' at the end. I've had a fetish events manager hire some other performers to do some acts before you head out on stage. I was thinking of introducing you as Ariana Grande..."</p>
<p>"Really, a Starbucks pun on my last name? That's pretty lame." Ariana once again interrupted.</p>
<p>"I mean the cover story is you are a fetish cover artist for Ariana Venti. It means people could suspect it's you, but that can just be dismissed as evidence that the cover artist was good. In this scenario a knock-off pun like that is the right way to go." Badiha explained.</p>
<p>"Fine, how about Ariana Vingt? It's what a Spanish woman started calling herself when my lawyers shut down Ariana Veinte."</p>
<p>"That's good, if it's already in use by other cover artists then it will diffuse suspicion." Badiha agreed. "Finally it's time to talk about what you want to do once on stage."</p>
<p>Ariana suddenly perked up, which made sense to Badiha, as proud as she was about the arrangements she had made to guarantee anonymity, she could imagine that those details were as important to Ariana as the wattage on her speakers or the toilet arrangement at her venues. Ariana was a performer so first and foremost in her mind was the performance.</p>
<p>"Like I said in my email, I want to do my set, naked and exposed." She explained.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you won't be able to do the full set, it's been advertised as a night of performances so two or three songs are all you'll have time for." Badiha informed.</p>
<p>"Alright then, if I had to choose I'd say Passions for me to strip down to, Dangerous Senses to do my most disgraceful naked dance, then finish up masturbating to Never Gonna Stop." Ariana chose without hesitation, she had clearly had this on her mind for a while.</p>
<p>"And your costume, do you want me to get something specific or..."</p>
<p>"I have one in mind, the outfit I wear for the opening act is actually even lewder than it first appears. It's made to come off in the most revealing stages, then all at once when needed." Ariana explained.</p>
<p>"Can you sneak it out in your bag when you leave the show?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"You'll also need to provide a mask."</p>
<p>"I've built one into the initial costume in the upcoming tour so it won't be out of place for a cover artist to be wearing one." Ariana explained, revealing a little more of the intelligence she had cynically hidden in favour of her popstar persona.</p>
<p>"Smart move." Badiha acknowledged. "Anything else you want in place or are you happy with how things stand."</p>
<p>Ariana had been acting disinterested, then professional, at this question she let her mask slip and revealed the excitable woman who had sent the email.</p>
<p>"That's good, I'm so excited, this is really happening!" She squealed.</p>
<p>"Great, in which case I'll get you back to your plane and I'll see you next month."</p>
<p>Badiha uncomfortably squirmed in her polyester cleaning lady uniform, a cunning move on her part to keep all the unsexy parts of hotel maid while leaving nothing for a sexy fantasy to grow on. She was sat in the car park of the Royal Irwellside hotel, waiting for Ariana's motorcade to roll in and out again before springing into action.</p>
<p>She fumbled with her phone to keep an eye on Grace's progress, she had deliberately delayed her client's big night to the same night as Ariana's performance to add suspense to her bet with Badiha. The army officer was due to have a night of no-holds-barred sexual objectification at the hands of the Oxford University Sailing society, chosen because Grace still had Oxford Uni contacts and it would be the best choice for athletic men who are also good with knots. For the sake of fairness they agreed it would be who could hold out against joining in with the client the longest after the event started, so Badiha was worried to see updates from Grace that the party had started, Commander Striker was already tied to a chair naked, and Grace was being the picture of restraint while the men teased her client with minor torments and elaborate plans for the night.</p>
<p>All of a sudden the huge black luxury car pulled into the car park, and Badiha watched Ariana get out flanked by bodyguards. Badiha counted to one hundred then began to make her way towards Ariana's room, her laundry box on a hotel issue trolley not garnering a second look from any of the guests she passed.</p>
<p>As expected Ariana had given her guards the night off and was nervously waiting for Badiha as she arrived. Badiha clumsily bundled her into the laundry box along with her costume change and makeup bag, before closing the lid and calmly wheeling her to the van.</p>
<p>Every step after that followed the plan exactly and before she knew it Badiha and Ariana were pulling into the car park in backstage area of the community theatre.</p>
<p>"Alright, you have your own private dressing room... of sorts." Badiha informed, directing Ariana's attention to a campervan parked near the back entrance. "I'm going to head in and see how preparations are going, you get ready in the campervan and I'll come get you when your performance is starting."</p>
<p>Ariana checked the coast was clear before running to the campervan, her gear in a bag under her arm while Badiha casually walked into the dressing rooms. Badiha had plenty of concerns about how she came by the other acts for the night. Malcolm had assured her the event organiser was the best in the business, had a thorough rolodex of smutty performers, and would be as accommodating as she was discrete.</p>
<p>The flurry of activity as she walked backstage was a credit to the trust she had put in a stranger she had never met before, it didn't take her long to be stood face to face with her.</p>
<p>"Are you one of the performers?" The woman asked directly and efficiently.</p>
<p>"No, I'm Badiha."</p>
<p>"Ah the producer, as it were. I'm Janine, it's good to meet face to face." She replied shaking Badiha's hand. "It's all coming together nicely, there's already a queue outside filled with the right kind of disreputable people, the dress rehearsals went well, in total we have four acts before your anonymous star takes to the stage."</p>
<p>"Good to hear." Badiha affirmed as Janine gave her a whistle stop tour of the facilities.</p>
<p>"Forgive me for asking, but will you be performing tonight?" Janine asked.</p>
<p>"Oh no, I'll just stay here and make sure everything's running smoothly."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about that, that's my job. Except during the third act where my job is to do some rather naughty things with a woman almost twice my age." Badiha was taken aback by the cavalier way Janine partook in the event she was organising. "Still, if you change your mind you know I won't judge."</p>
<p>Janine showed Badiha into the changing room where the other acts were getting ready. There was a fairly impressive double-jointed woman limbering up, a man with the largest penis she had ever seen, Nicole Quinn, a woman already threading rope through her extensive range of piercings...</p>
<p>Badiha had to pause for a second to take in what her mind has just glossed over.</p>
<p>"Nicole!" Badiha suddenly yelled in realisation, turning the head of her former training partner.</p>
<p>"Cock Holster please." Nicole corrected.</p>
<p>"Oh, I didn't know you still..." Badiha began.</p>
<p>"You used more than five words." Nicole interrupted with a gasp.</p>
<p>"You're still following the rules aren't you?" Badiha noticed.</p>
<p>"Cock Holster is happy. Cock Holster is now a sex slave. Cunt was not happy?" Nicole asked.</p>
<p>"Cunt was great... I was great." Badiha replied, catching herself falling into old patterns. "But I needed to return to my old life."</p>
<p>"Why?" There was a heavy pause while Nicole's question hung in the air. Eventually Badiha moved on.</p>
<p>"So you're performing tonight?"</p>
<p>"Yes, first act. Cock Holster gives talk on history." She explained. "Would cunt like to join my act?"</p>
<p>"Oh... no." Badiha replied, straining her self-restraint. "Cunt needs to... I need to organise things."</p>
<p>"OK. Can Cunt help me move things onstage?" Nicole asked. Badiha figured she could at least help a friend out and agreed.</p>
<p>Nicole showed Badiha to the various devices she was planning to have on stage and Badiha's mind roared back to her time on the island. There were tables full of smaller devices, several variants of the pear of anguish prominent among them. Then there were a couple of larger devices, a rack, some stocks, a pillory, a wooden horse, and one Badiha couldn't even identify. One by one they moved everything to the empty stage, the murmur of the crowd a constant presence on the other side of the curtain. Nicole referring to Badiha as Cunt at every turn. Her mind dissolving with every deviant device they laid out.</p>
<p>"That's all the things. Thank you Cunt." Nicole announced as they moved a large chest into place.</p>
<p>"Cunt was glad to help." Badiha replied, not even fighting her former talking rules.</p>
<p>"Show starts soon. Last chance to join the act. I can see you are aroused..."</p>
<p>"Good evening ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, your first act of the evening. Cock Holster and Cunt!"</p>
<p>Badiha was looking at her feet as the curtain opened on her and Nicole, naked but for the metal collars around their necks.</p>
<p>'I'm definitely going to lose the bet.' Badiha thought to herself. 'The time between the start of the show and me joining in was precisely 0 seconds.'</p>
<p>Nicole turned her back to the audience and threw a ball over her head. A man caught it and looked at it with confusion until Nicole beckoned him onstage and handed him a piece of paper with a pre-written speech on it that had been hastily pluralised.</p>
<p>"Welcome to our show. We are here to demonstrate the brutal torture devices of history, but with more of a focus on fun than death or permanent disfigurement. As prisoners we are not allowed to speak, only obey. Please pick one torture device for each of us, explain what it does, then throw the ball into the crowd to pick a new tormentor. We will continue to do this until a loud gong indicates our time is up, then whoever is onstage will read the gold piece of paper." He read out loud. For a moment he was taken aback but soon found himself perusing the items on display. He stopped by the stocks and picked up the tag on it to read.</p>
<p>"These are stocks, not to be confused with a pillory. In a pillory the board securing the prisoner is secured to the head and wrists and raised off the ground. Whereas with the stocks is just the board, with holes for the head, wrists and ankles, forcing the subject to sit bent double on the floor." He announced, beckoning over Nicole to demonstrate.</p>
<p>Nicole removed her metal collar, then bent herself over with practiced precision, placing her head, arms, and legs into the holes so fast the man seemed slow and bumbling as he slipped the other part of the stocks in place and locked Nicole in. He then moved over to the pillory and flashed Badiha a mischievous grin.</p>
<p>"The description of this is pretty much the same but opposite of the one I just read so let's skip straight to putting our prisoner in." Badiha found herself drawn to obey, removing her collar, then placing her head and arms inside the pillory, her mind growing fuzzier by the moment as she felt the relentless wood lock into place. As an added humiliation the man turned the pillory around so Badiha stumbled and rotated until her bottom was facing the crowd. Badiha drank in her humiliation as the rustle and footsteps of the next member of the crowd being selected happened out of her view.</p>
<p>"The scold's bridle was a device often used by husbands or father's on women who were becoming too outspoken. It is designed to clip onto the head and stop the subject talking, some variety in designs has been found in history, so we have also altered it to include a cock shaped gag." The audience member announced. Badiha braced herself but then heard the telltale sounds gagging from Nicole that suggested she was going first. Afterwards the audience gasped at the choice that had been made.</p>
<p>"The pear of anguish." The new audience member announced and Badiha squirmed with the core erotic memories that device held for her. The blood coursing through her veins rumbled in her ears and time stood still while the audience was treated to a quick history on the device. Then Badiha felt a familiar pressure pushing at her anus, she relaxed and felt the pear slip in. In the interests of time the audience member had the forethought to throw the ball out to the next member while they dealt with the pear, so as Badiha felt her sphincter begin to stretch, she heard a stern woman reading out the next device.</p>
<p>"This is a pear of anguish specially adapted to go into a prisoner's vagina, pretty anachronistic but otherwise fun." She announced. Badiha couldn't see but Nicole had been turned around so her prostrated body was face down ass up for the audience's benefit. Badiha felt herself groaning in familiar painful enjoyment in unison with her sex slave partner.</p>
<p>Eventually the audience member torturing Badiha reached the limit Nicole had built into her device to stop it doing permanent damage, she then simply shuddered at an audience being able to see inside of her.</p>
<p>"Most times when we hear about breast tortures in the bad old days, we hear about St. Agatha and other unfortunate women having them torn off. But that wouldn't be fun for a light hearted sex show so instead I've got a classic vice that often got used on body parts so must have been used on tits in the past." She explained. Badiha felt two lengths of wood placed to frame her breasts, flexible enough to bend a little, but still too snug for comfort. Then she felt the screws at each end begin to tighten, her breasts heating up from their ever constricting base.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>After a couple of turns the audience began to yell at Badiha's tormentor to throw the ball out so they could keep the show going as she continued her labourious torture of Badiha. Each turn of the screws tightening the wood around Badiha's breasts until the limits Nicole built in stopped it going any further.</p>
<p>'Thank god my tits are smaller than Nicole's.' Badiha thought to herself. '...for now.'</p>
<p>Badiha was so absorbed in her own torture she hadn't even heard the description of the (softened) cat o'nine tails gracing Nicole's bottom, each scream of pain being followed by a cheer from the audience and a subtle moan of lust from Nicole. There was a small pause after the end of the whipping while the audience member picked out another thing for Badiha.</p>
<p>"Nipple clamps. Tried, true, and actually surprisingly recent as an invention."</p>
<p>'Holy shit' thought Badiha, 'they're going after my tits. I suppose that's poetic considering this is a goodbye tour for my C-cups.' she still couldn't see what was going on the other side of her pillory, but two explosions of pain from her nipples told her that the clips had been applied.</p>
<p>Badiha drank in the pain as she heard the next audience member introduce the paddle to the audience and begin paddling the already punished ass of Nicole. Each squeal of pain a foreboding countdown to Badiha's next humiliation. When the squeals had stopped, there was a heavy pause before Badiha heard her fate.</p>
<p>"The tongue tearer, it was a common punishment in certain societies to have the tongue removed, however I don't think anyone would enjoy that so instead I've adapted these forceps to force my tongue to hang out of my mouth like a hungry dog."</p>
<p>The audience member turned Badiha around so everyone could see her face. Badiha was suddenly confronted with the hungry eyes of the people who until that point had been staring at her exposed holes and tortured tits, a sudden reminder of how humiliating her situation was. She hesitated before dutifully sticking out her tongue like a good slave, feeling to forceps grip around it, weighing it down, keeping her mouth open and tongue out of the way so she could stay perfectly prepared for anyone who wanted to fuck her face.</p>
<p>As she was being prepared, the loud gong sounded and Badiha breathed a dejected sigh of relief. The person on stage dutifully went to the gold piece of paper as instructed to bring the show to a close.</p>
<p>"I may have told a slight fib." The paper announced through the dutiful audience member. "The gong doesn't mean our time is up, it means we are halfway through the show. The most common torture and torment of the past for women who had earned the ire of powerful men was, of course, rape. Now once again we aren't exactly copying history, this isn't rape because we want this, nonetheless any audience member who wants to can come up on stage and fuck our punished bodies. Form an orderly queue, feel free to remove any devices in the way, and enjoy ravishing our holes until the gong sounds again."</p>
<p>Badiha was most surprised by how restrained the audience was. She expected everyone to rush the stage but instead a broad smattering of men formed an orderly queue, clearly they were no strangers to this kind of event and the prospect of other acts kept every man from wanting to come up. Nevertheless Badiha soon found herself at crotch level of a man rapidly loosening his trousers. He pulled on the forceps, forcing Badiha's tongue down and easing his cock in. Badiha gripped her thumbs and suppressed her gag reflex as the cock slid down her throat. As she did so she felt the pear of anguish being loosened from behind. She felt a brief warmth followed by a release in pressure of the device being removed from her, shortly to be replaced by the penis of her unseen tormentor.</p>
<p>The stage was a whirlwind of degradation, Badiha and Nicole both cycled through uncountable men, each waiting their turn and taking over every time someone finished. Badiha felt her mouth grow sticky with cum, dribbling on the floor below as the forceps kept her mouth open. She couldn't see the other side of the stocks but her pussy and ass were being fucked depending on each audience member's taste, so they soon felt gooey from the juices spilled. When the gong struck again, Badiha was not dejected, she felt well and truly violated as the curtains closed and stage hands helped her and Nicole out of their devices and off the stage.</p>
<p>"Did Cunt enjoy herself?" Nicole asked.</p>
<p>"Cunt was good fuck meat." Badiha stammered as they walked towards the changing rooms, dripping all the way.</p>
<p>"Does cunt want to join my act?" Nicole asked. Badiha's mind spun. What a thought, give up this life of toiling and fixing things, just leave it all to Grace so she could tour with Nicole getting degraded and violated on stage all the time. She was so tempted, had she been asked the day after their island training she might have said yes, but in the gooey afterglow of pleasurable degradation, her sanity played a trick her deviancy had been using for a while and interjected before her brain could have a say in the matter.</p>
<p>"No thank you." Badiha replied. "But can I have your number, I'm sure you can help with some adventures in the future."</p>
<p>There was a deep look of disappointment in Nicole's eyes as Badiha dressed, casually regaining her humanity in front of Nicole, taunting her ability to do something Nicole hadn't done since the island. Once she had cleaned herself up and put her clothes back on, she immediately stepped back into the role of somebody in total control. As Janine finished up her third act and the stagehands got to work setting up the stage for the fourth act, Badiha decided it was the best time to go check on Ariana.</p>
<p>Ariana let out a little shriek as Badiha opened the door to the campervan, she was already dressed in her iconic show starting costume, an electric pink two piece, consisting of a pvc pink crop top, matching thonged bloomers, and plenty of tulle flair to disguise the fact she was basically in her underwear. She was also in her trademark matching thigh high boots and hair tightly bound over her head then gathered into a long ponytail.</p>
<p>"The shower in this campervan is shit." She immediately announced once she recognised Badiha.</p>
<p>"Didn't expect you to take a shower." Badiha replied.</p>
<p>"Well my fantasy was to be hairless from my toes to my cranium, so of course I was going to give myself a fresh shave." She replied, putting on some final touches to her makeup.</p>
<p>"Alright, well you're on next so you better put on your mask and head in." Badiha informed. Ariana followed her instructions and put on the pink kitten mask she had been wearing throughout the tour, while also taking the time to grab her handbag on the way out.</p>
<p>Ariana left and returned to the caravan three or four times, each time claiming to have forgotten something or do one last thing, Badiha recognised this as nerves but wasn't one to judge, she just smiled politely as the pop-star psyched herself up for the show. Eventually Badiha managed to get her through the stage door and from there on Ariana switched to autopilot, taking up her sparkling pink microphone and getting ready for her grand entrance.</p>
<p>The music began and the crowd was quite excited considering it was a simple music act after the smut that had been on before. Ariana started with Passions, a song about surrendering to your passions even if it brings the world down around you, a risky song when given sanitising context by record labels, but downright dirty as she pulled on the right buckles, removing the bra but leaving the tulle flair behind to frame her now freed breasts. Ariana practically shoved the microphone down her throat as she moaned her way through the chorus, running her hands sensuously down her body before unzipping two hidden zips that allowed her to remove the bloomers without the hassle of dragging them down her legs and over her thigh high boots.</p>
<p>She pulled the most lascivious pose her dance teacher had taught her as Passions faded out and Dangerous Senses began to play, an ode to the physicality of ecstacy, it paired perfectly with the naked dance Ariana had choreographed for the occasion. She was meant to spend this song dancing, but Badiha could see the rabid impatience in her eyes as her hands began to linger more on her pussy. Eventually she couldn't handle the build-up any more and rushed to the side of the stage to get her handbag, pulling out of it a pink dildo she began to rub against herself. Every so often she would throw to one side another bit of flair, also taking off her boots, her movements becoming clumsy and rabid until she stood naked on stage but for her pink mask and matching dildo probing in and out of her pussy.</p>
<p>Then she grabbed the bottom of her mask and lifted it up. Badiha screamed 'no' from the sidelines but her voice was lost to the loud music. However what really surprised Badiha was as the mask floated over her head, her hair seemed to go with it.</p>
<p>Badiha had assumed when Ariana had kept saying 'hairless from my toes to my cranium" she was just being artistic and didn't genuinely mean that she would also have her head shaved. Yet here she was, international pop sensation Ariana Venti now naked and totally shaved as she finished the last chords to Dangerous Senses and moved on to her next song.</p>
<p>The audience certainly noticed this act did look a lot like Ariana Venti, the only thing keeping the certainty at bay was nobody would suspect Ariana Venti of shaving her head. Let alone taking out a metal collar, snapping it around her neck, and beginning to masturbate as she (barely) sung Never Gonna Stop, a song written about people who thought her act was too sexual to inform them she's only just getting started, especially prophetic as she moaned and gasped with orgasmic joy. At one of the instrumental sections she gasped out.</p>
<p>"Anyone who wants to cum on Ariana Venti's exposed body, this is your only chance."</p>
<p>What men and women remained unspent from the previous acts came on stage and started rubbing themselves over the degraded singer as she plunged the pink dildo in and out of herself. She squealed and moaned, the words of her song mixing with her orgasmic joy at being seen, truly seen. She was exposed and everyone was expressing their naked lust in the purest form of desecration. Each ribbon of cum landing on her body struck her to her core until the song concluded and the sticky heavy breathing mess of Ariana Venti lay on the stage swimming in post performance ecstasy.</p>
<p>As the curtain closed, Badiha helped pick Ariana off the floor and began guiding her to the shower.</p>
<p>"How are you going to explain your shaved head?" She asked.</p>
<p>"I've been wearing wigs for years. Now they're just going to be over a bit less hair for a bit."</p>
<p>Badiha stared at her front door, willing Grace to walk through it. She knew what was coming, the admission of her failure and acceptance of consequences, but she still awaited the other partner in crime. Badiha had headed back the moment Ariana was safely returned to her hotel, but Grace was taking her time.</p>
<p>'She should be back by now, it's 3pm' Badiha thought to herself. She debated texting her, but the radio silence from Grace carried a mystique that she was sure her reciprocal lack of communication was helping with. Eventually sod's law did a job that Badiha's waiting had failed at, she nipped to the toilet and when she came back Grace was in her living room looking tired and content.</p>
<p>"Alright, how long did you last?" Grace immediately asked.</p>
<p>"You're the employee, I want to hear your story first." Badiha replied, pouring two cups of coffee and sitting down expectantly.</p>
<p>"So as I said, most of the focus was on Commander Striker, the Sailing Society eventually settled for using her as a prize for the variety of drinking games they had. About an hour in, one guy notices I'm just sitting to one side and he invites me to come join the party, which I decline. They don't like that, so little do I know they start a new game, first to get a drink in me gets the next go abusing the Commander." Grace explained, Badiha could already see the direction her night was taking.</p>
<p>"Eventually one of them convinced me to join a drinking game, as you know how I like games. I was doing really well at first, but because they had so much fun betting on me, I didn't realise they had started a new set of games in secret, each pushing further and further into what they could get me to do."</p>
<p>"How long before they had you tied up next to the Commander?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"No, they didn't let the Commander know about me. The Commander was the prize for winning, I was eventually made the more humiliating runner up prize. They saved the full sexual thrills for the commander and reduced me to cleanup and torment for their amusement."</p>
<p>"How long?" Badiha asked more insistently this time.</p>
<p>"I started playing drinking games after an hour and fifteen minutes. I first got naked after an hour and a half." Grace admitted looking at her feet.</p>
<p>"That means you beat me by an hour and a half." Badiha replied, instantly replacing Grace's shame with curiosity as she began her story.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Badiha awoke to a familiar pair of sensations. The quiet of once again having the house to herself, and the still unfamiliar balancing issues of her newly G-cup breasts, still needing to be contained within a heaving sports bra for a bit longer as per doctor's orders. Nevertheless Badiha immediately went to her shower room. Showers had been Badiha's favourite time of day throughout the healing process, she could remove the sports bra and let her augmented chest bust free. She would often take very lingering glances in the mirror to admire her body, now a huge step towards being purely a sexual object. Then she could get in the shower and be as liberal as she wanted with her lotion, massaging her body, sparing no nerve ending the joy of her luxurious caress.</p>
<p>Once out of the shower Badiha would thoroughly dry her breasts and then once again recontain them in the sports bra.</p>
<p>"Four more days." She told herself, treating the upcoming end of her recovery period as a grand unveiling for the newer, sexier Badiha. She couldn't wait to no longer constrict and contain her huge breasts.</p>
<p>As she dried herself off she wiped some errant bubbles away from her tattoo, now three flowers after another job put her in a position to sell her body. She wondered how extensive her floral arrangement would be in the future she was building herself, there were certainly chances aplenty ahead.</p>
<p>Badiha dressed herself in her professional outfit, finding it helped her focus on work when there were distractions aplenty around. As she sat down with her laptop to check that day's emails, she heard her front buzzer going off. It seemed a bit early for Grace's arrival, but she had been more enthusiastic since Badiha made it clear that their bet would not be a one time thing. Today they were planning on coming up with their next wager based on whatever emailed job would fit their desires and maybe her enthusiasm is why she had arrived before Badiha's hair had even had time to dry.</p>
<p>Badiha thoughtlessly pressed the door unlock button, the mechanical buzz from her speaker confirming her guest was allowed in. She made herself a cup of coffee on her fancy coffee machine and waited.</p>
<p>"Coffee?" Badiha asked as her door opened and Clementine Maximus bounded in disheveled and nervous.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes please." She replied, closing and locking the door behind herself. "Don't suppose you have anything to Irish up the coffee do you?"</p>
<p>"Clementine, what are you doing here?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry, I need a favour and you are the only person I trust."</p>
<p>Badiha looked into Clementine's eyes and worried about the sort of situation that would lead her to make that statement.</p>


<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>"Alright, alright. What happened?" Badiha cleared the air, adding a healthy dosage of whiskey to Clementine's morning coffee.</p>
<p>"Did you get breast implants since I last saw you?" Clementine asked, even when asking a favour she felt the need to do her strange power play of controlling the conversation, making sure Badiha was reacting to what she was saying.</p>
<p>"Yup, lost a bet and now I have these mammoth E-cup tits. So what happened?" Badiha curtly replied hoping a blunt response would keep the conversation from being derailed. Clementine took a big swig from her mug, burning her mouth with the heat of the coffee and her throat with the concentration of whiskey.</p>
<p>"That's actually about the size of mine, and mine are natural."</p>
<p>"Clementine!" Badiha sternly yelled, actually breaking through the calm coldness with which Clementine carried herself.</p>
<p>"Fine, I misjudged John Dobson, the father of the woman who's movie trailer you produced and distributed."</p>
<p>"The MP?"</p>
<p>"And now junior treasury minister. I saw him as a perennial backbencher, chronically unimpressive so never successful enough to rise especially high where he would have additional scrutiny and security, but clued in enough to be useful. Regrettably I didn't know his position had been purposefully cultivated. He's getting a considerable amount of money from a variety of interested parties, often embedded in foreign governments, to be their eyes and ears in parliament. So when I used his daughter's indiscretions to try and get some inside information on currency markets, he laughed at me. He told me that as a backbencher in a safe seat he was pretty much scandal proof, it would ruin his daughter's life but he had prepared to come out of it unscathed ever since you sent her video to the conservatives."</p>
<p>"Callous motherfucker, willing to toss his daughter to the wolves like that."</p>
<p>"I don't sympathize but It makes sense, he can publically be there for her and none of the stink will stick to him. But even though he doesn't care for her, he was remarkably insulted about being blackmailed and already had a bee in his bonnet about some of my Westminster activities. He set about destroying me with resources I certainly couldn't match." Clementine explained between sips of her coffee.</p>
<p>"So when your daughter called looking for you, you were in hiding?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"Growing up wealthy, a lot of these kids don't realise that their sociopathic parents constany confuse paying for a child with actually raising one. I made no such mistake with Bella. She was raised to have talent and succeed without nepotism, and I loved her enough and kept her in the loop enough that I knew I could cut her off for her own safety and she would understand and thrive on her own." Clementine sighed, her concern for her daughter remained the only warm crack in her cold calculating veneer. "I've been calling in a lot of favours to stay ahead of the people who want to harm me, but at every turn someone involved always ends up betraying me. I've had so many close calls, but when I had a moment to think, I realised you're not the betraying type, you may not be best placed to help me, lord knows I'm not asking for some cheap sexual gratification, but you are my safest pair of hands."</p>
<p>Badiha was reeling, she was a drug dealer turned pervert, this was all much higher stakes than she was used to.</p>
<p>"How much do these guys know about me?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"I burned the connection to your laptop so they don't have your clients, but they know the kind of service you provide, it's probably why they don't see you as a threat." Clementine answered, blossoming an idea in Badiha's mind.</p>
<p>"I think I have a way to get you to safety, but you're going to have to trust me and you're going to have to leave your ego at the door."</p>
<p>John Dobson hated this part of his role in life, gathering dirt on other MPs meant going to their most hedonistic parties and having to once again cheat on his wife to keep his cover as someone as morally bankrupt as the rest of the MPs.</p>
<p>Tonight's party was billed as a 'party like no other' by some up and coming special advisor called Monique. Loads of ambitious young-uns try and organise the most memorable evenings of debauchery to stamp their claims on being future leaders. The only indication this party would be any different is that Monique was a special advisor to an MP with the reputation of a sexual appetite far higher than average and maybe this might unlock some new avenues for him.</p>
<p>He drove to a stately home on the outskirts of Kings Lynn, the proximity to the Sandringham Royal Estate either meant a member of the royal family was going to be present, or someone at least wanted everyone to think a royal was going to be there. It was reassuring to have armed security checking his ID at a gate far from the house, and valet parking so people couldn't identify whose cars were parked out front. He stepped out of his car and through the large oak doors.</p>
<p>The foyer was a similar mixture of mahogany, marble, and gold gilding that seemed commonplace for John, a level of extravagance that he had grown accustomed to. The gathered men in ubiquitous suits, only differentiated by their ties and shirts, mulled as they were served drinks and canapés by women wearing nothing but black PVC head masks. This was unusual, but still not the first occasion John had been to with naked waitresses. What made the situation interesting for John was the diverse range of body types on display. Usually these sort of affairs would have hired a smattering of amateur models and high end prostitutes that ran the gambit from skinny white girls in their late teens to skinny white girls in their early 20s. However he was handed a glass of champagne from a busty woman who had hit upper middle age well but was clearly of older stock, then given canapés by a taller and more statuesque character than would usually be hired, before finally being offered a bump of cocaine from a tray held by an Asian lady with huge fake tits.</p>
<p>The attendees were more sparce than usual, showing Monique's inexperience at hosting these parties. In the fullness of time she will understand that allowing the guests to wear masks (rather than just the help), often boosted attendance by swaying those on the fence for the sake of performative propriety. At least it helped John keep an eye on if any new faces were among the rotation of the parliamentary perverts.</p>
<p>He did his usual circulation, chatting shit about golf and upcoming votes, letting his hands wander around the waitresses to fit in with the others, all the while wondering if the party would be going anywhere or if naked staff was the peak of Monique's innovation. As a conversation about immigrants got tiresomely predictable, John let his ears wander, hoping to pick up a snippet of gossip or something worthwhile.</p>
<p>"Alright, Badiha says we go to the next stage in five minutes." John heard Monique informing an unseen accomplice. His mind took but a moment to figure out where he'd heard that name before. He remembered within the ugliness with Clementine Maximus, the strange side hustle of a woman offering extreme sexual fantasy fulfilment for connected women, who counted his daughter a client and Clementine a boss.</p>
<p>Suddenly the diverse body types made sense, this party was not for the benefit of the guests, but for the clutch of deviant women to experience being naked waitresses for the night. He eyed up each in passing, desperately trying to figure out if he could recognise them by body type, surely part of the appeal would be serving people you know without their knowledge. Maybe the guest list was sparce because each waitress had a list of people they wanted to secretly flaunt their body to and he was on it. Just as he began to wonder about what 'the next stage' could mean, Monique took a position at one end of a room where she could yell and gather everyone's attention.</p>
<p>"Good evening gentlemen, thank you for joining me, we have a little special treat for this evening, some of our waitresses have been paid a little extra to take part in a raffle of sorts. All of your names are in this hat, I will be picking them out one at a time and if you are lucky, you will get to take a waitress to a private room and do literally anything you want to them as long as you do not remove the mask." Monique announced to widespread murmurs of approval.</p>
<p>Monique picked out the first name, a moderately attractive Labour whip with a dark reputation, he was immediately paired with a woman John could imagine was the MP Monique worked for, her body seemed the right age and proportions. This was when he became certain the name draw was rigged to the women's fantasies and pretended to text so he could make notes of each name being pulled for later investigation. Which is why he was startled silent when he heard his own name called.</p>
<p>"Go on John, you lucky prick, go claim your prize and give her hell." One of his friends encouraged, making it crystal clear that staying to take notes was no longer an option beyond suspicion for him. He walked to the front and was joined arm in arm by a naked woman he recognised as the one who had handed him champagne at the start. As a show for the audience he gave her ample bottom a loud swat as she guided him towards a private room, locking the door behind herself.</p>
<p>The room had clearly been set up for the purpose, there was a four poster bed in the middle, with cabinets covered in condoms and deviant sex toys for John to use. The woman looked at him pleadingly, clearly awaiting orders from the master who had won her in a rigged upper-class perverted take on tombola. John tried his best to figure out who had taken the effort to be in this position, there were only a handful of women it could be but he wasn't getting any clues. He picked up some handcuffs and ordered his new property to lie on the bed while he cuffed her wrists and ankles to the 4 corners. As he was doing so he surreptitiously examined her mask, marveling at Badiha's forethought in locking the mask on with a small padlock so none of the guests could remove it while alone with her clients.</p>
<p>He then pulled down his trousers, climbed onto the bed, and started easing his cock in and out of the open mouth of his slave. He adjusted his position so the padlock was in view, and his captive couldn't see anything but his balls bouncing off her face while he thrust himself down her throat. As he did so he got a specially bent paperclip out of his shirt pocket.</p>
<p>'Badiha needs to do her homework better' he thought to himself as he began to pick the lock. 'Then again if Clementine didn't know I was a foreign asset, I doubt her kinky side business associate would know that picking a lock is one of the first things they teach you when they bring you onboard.'</p>
<p>He climbed off the woman's face, looked deep into her eyes, and then in one swift motion yanked the PVC mask off of her face.</p>
<p>Clementine let out a scream as an evil grin crossed over John's face.</p>
<p>"Clementine Maximus, if you wanted to meet you could have just asked." He chuckled as he dropped the mask to the ground. "I didn't realise you got so hands on with Badiha's work. Unless..." John took the opportunity to do a more thorough search of the room and eventually spotted the hidden camera he suspected.</p>
<p>"Trying to blackmail your way out of a problem, just like you. Unfortunately now I have you alone and..." John's monologue was interrupted by the door being unlocked from the outside, suddenly Badiha barged in with a taser in her hand.</p>
<p>"Alright John, you figured it out, so let's make a deal." Badiha announced.</p>
<p>"Why would I make a deal with you?" John asked.</p>
<p>"Because someone's going to fill the vacuum left by Clementine's demise, and now her plan has failed it's time for me to move in and look after number one."</p>
<p>"What?" Clementine cried.</p>
<p>"Shut up whore, you're done for, the only thing keeping you out of an Uzbek black site is that your pussy is worth something to me." Badiha snarled before turning back to John. "Clementine has been working as a prostitute for some time now, I have all the proof and can use it to keep her in place, I'll move in on her operation, promise to stay out of your way, and in return you get to fuck her whenever and however you want."</p>
<p>"Why was Clementine working as a prostitute for you?" John calmly asked.</p>
<p>"Did you ever wonder how I managed to operate without taking a penny from my clients?"</p>
<p>"It was a curiosity when I read your file." John admitted.</p>
<p>"I have been slowly building the most exclusive stable of whores in the world, wealthy influential women who get off so much on having their bodies sold, that they let me keep all the cash. I imagine with all the enemies she has made Clementine is going to make me a fortune when I start selling her ass."</p>
<p>"Badiha, what are you doing?" Clementine begged.</p>
<p>"I'm cashing in on you, you old has-been. What do you say, she's no longer a threat to you and you can do whatever you want to her." Badiha offered, her hand seductively stroking the helpless naked body of her former overseer.</p>
<p>"I want proof, who else do you have in your stable?" John demanded.</p>
<p>"I know you're an asset, I'm not giving you the keys to my empire. How about I meet you halfway, I'll confirm any suspicions you have? You get three guesses."</p>
<p>"Alright, everyone knows you were involved in that whole Aeris PLC debacle, shortly afterwards Grace is suddenly persona non grata with her family." He deduced. Badiha pressed some buttons on her phone and soon Grace entered the room, taking off her mask.</p>
<p>"What can I do for you master?" She announced, standing to attention.</p>
<p>"This one's a long shot, but my contacts have been concerned that out of nowhere Suriya Al-Harani stepped back from running one of the largest investment portfolios in the world, one that benefitted them greatly. They were pulling their hair out trying to figure out if it was related to her husband's loss in desire for prostitutes." A few more taps on her phone and sure enough Suriya entered the room, taking off her mask.</p>
<p>"What can I do for you master?" She announced taking her place next to Grace. Despite the intensity of the situation, Badiha couldn't help but notice there were a few more flowers tattooed on her hip since the last time she had seen her.</p>
<p>"You definitely got a tip-off when the police raided your house, about the same time Deputy Commissioner Phillips took some annual leave." He guessed.</p>
<p>"'fraid you struck out on that third one. Shame because the woman who tipped me off is probably the kinkiest of the lot." Badiha gloated.</p>
<p>"Alright then. I think we can make this work." John agreed, shaking Badiha's hand, "now as for this former powerhouse, may I have her for the evening?"</p>
<p>"As long as you hand her back to me by midnight she's all yours." Badiha informed as John came up with a malevolent plan to stamp his victory on his defeated rival.</p>
<p>John relished the guffaws coming from the gathered men he was talking with, he knew each and every one he had expertly cajoled into a single group conversation, and he knew they had one major thing in common, they all hated Clementine.</p>
<p>"More Champagne?" A naked waitress offered, John paused and signaled for quiet in his group.</p>
<p>"Hold on, say that again." He ordered, an evil grin crossing his mouth.</p>
<p>"More... more Champagne." The waitress stuttered.</p>
<p>"Holy shit guys I know that voice, is that you Clementine Maximus?" He announced to gathered gasps.</p>
<p>"No, you're mistaken." The waitress countered, the panic spreading across her face clear enough to be noticeable even under the PVC mask. Quick as a flash John grabbed her mask and ripped it off to unveil her to his friends.</p>
<p>"Clementine, you're one of our naked waitresses?"</p>
<p>"I... am" she mumbled looking at her feet.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, I never knew Clementine was such a slut." One of John's friends announced to more guffaws from the group.</p>
<p>"She must be. Why would someone forcing her to do this allow her to wear a mask? I bet she does it for fun." John deduced to much chuckling commentary. "Is that true?"</p>
<p>"Yes sir. You've figured out my secret. Deep down I love nothing more than to be humiliated." She agreed.</p>
<p>"Well we are going to make this a night to remember for you." John cheered, gathering everyone over to Clementine's exposed body. Immediately the cameraphones came out and Clementine winced with each flash that confirmed another record of her naked humiliation had been captured. "Christian, remember when Clementine threatened to show your wife videos that would end your marriage if you didn't remove legislation at committee? I think you would feel better if you got revenge on her tits don't you?"</p>
<p>"Oh absolutely." An older man agreed, stepping forward to roughly grasp Clementine's breasts, kneading and squeezing them without a care for Clementine's painful disapproval.</p>
<p>"And Giles, remember how she released footage of you doing drugs just as the Prime Minister was considering you for the cabinet? I think maybe giving her a nice red bottom should go some way towards compensation."</p>
<p>"It would be a start." An even older man chimed in, giving Clementine the first of many hearty spanks on her bare behind, her screams of painful humiliation drawn out by Christian's decision to painfully squeeze and twist her nipples between his thumb and forefinger.</p>
<p>"You know I genuinely think she is enjoying this." John announced, relishing his place puppeteering powerful people through the indulgence of naked sadism. "Henry, go spread her labia, let's open up her pussy so everyone can see how wet she is."</p>
<p>Clementine remained stunned still, screaming with each swat on her butt and manhandle of her breasts, while another elderly white man opened up her pussy for all the guests to laugh at.</p>
<p>"Now I know she's a bit old and flabby, but who here would like to fuck Clementine Maximus?" John asked the crowd, to which there was some sporadic cheering. "Well we're not going to give her any privacy tonight. So how about anybody who wants a piece, write your phone number on her body and she'll call you to arrange a little date."</p>
<p>There was some immediate commotion as men scrambled to find a pen to follow John's instructions. After a bit of time he saw the first few men approaching with markers and ill intent.</p>
<p>"Welcome to your new life as a whore." He whispered in Clementine's ear before pushing her towards the crowd. He gestured to Badiha to follow him into a private room.</p>
<p>They entered a room that had been set aside as one of the sex rooms from earlier, a similar four poster bed and a selection of used sex toys undermining the high stakes negotiation John had in mind.</p>
<p>"That was fun. I'm riding that high so it's probably ill advised for me to be discussing terms, but you've impressed me with your cutthroat attitude. So what does starting where Clementine left off mean for you?"</p>
<p>"She's given me her contact lists and information. Hopefully you have heard my reputation, my aversion to blackmail and more mutually beneficial approach." Badiha explained.</p>
<p>"Sounds like the sort of thing small timers tell themselves to rationalise not being big timers but I'll let it slide. So this isn't going to be a clean break, you're moving up in the world but I want constant communication so I can tell you if you're stepping on my toes." John explained.</p>
<p>"Alright, how about I lend you Clementine once a fortnight, afterwards I come to pick her up and we talk business."</p>
<p>"With your reputation I'm not having you visit my house. How about we meet once a month at a neutral location to discuss which 4 days I get Clementine for, and so you can transfer 50% of her fee into my account, after all it is my threat that's going to keep her in line for you." John negotiated.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>"How about you get 50% of the fee from the business she drums up tonight, but 30% after that."</p>
<p>"Deal, I'll meet you on the 23rd at the Charter Hill Cafe."</p>
<p>"No way, nowhere independent where the owner could be in your pocket. We'll pick a different Starbucks each month." Badiha countered.</p>
<p>"Fine. Hopefully I can do things to Clementine that are more distasteful than the American dishwater they serve there." John dryly quipped as he shook Badiha's hand. "One last thing. I noticed your body type seems to match one of the naked waitresses from earlier tonight."</p>
<p>"Your point?" Badiha sniffed.</p>
<p>"If you fuck me on this deal, or Clementine gets away from you, you'll be taking her place, am I clear?" John threatened before his face immediately turned back to the pleasant smile he plastered on for parties. "You want to go check in on our working girl?"</p>
<p>As Badiha and John rejoined the party, the various waitresses had all moved to one side so the guests could focus on Clementine. The MP that Monique worked for had snuck away, worried that she might get a similar treatment, and Badiha made a mental note to inform her that Clementine's unmasking and poor treatment was planned so she didn't feel Badiha's offer was a trap.</p>
<p>Clementine was squatting in the middle of the group, her body covered in red marks and phone numbers, she had one bottle of champagne upended over her mouth, the frothy mess overflowing down her body. A second bottle of champagne had been stood upright on the floor so Clementine could be forced to squat until the neck of the bottle penetrated her pussy. The jeers and mocking laughter of people she had crossed now saturating the air.</p>
<p>"Everyone having fun?" John asked to the cheers of the crowd. "Alright then, now everyone who wants to fuck her has written their number on her, so this need not descend into an uncouth orgy, we'll all have our shot in private."</p>
<p>The crowd cheered as John pulled Clementine up by her hair, backing up against the wall so her audience were now all standing in front of her rather than the encirclement she had previously had. John relished taking control of the situation, not to mention the extra income he would get selling Clementine's body rather than giving it away for free at the party.</p>
<p>"But for now I think you should apologise." John announced.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry." Clementine immediately responded to the audience.</p>
<p>"And why are you sorry?" John prompted. Clementine stopped for a moment to think.</p>
<p>"For... blackmailing and betraying you in order to..." John interrupted Clementine with a flurry of slaps on her body, before grabbing her hair and holding her to face the audience again.</p>
<p>"Why are you sorry?"</p>
<p>"For interfering with..." once again John interrupted with a volley of slaps, this time focussing on making her tits painfully jiggle for the crowd.</p>
<p>"Seems like you're having difficulties, let me help you out." John announced. He whispered something in her ear and Clementine's face contorted to a look of sheer humiliation.</p>
<p>"So why are you sorry?" John once again asked. Clementine looked pleadingly at him but saw his sadistic resolve that she continue.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for acting like I belong among you. I am a sub-human whore who should only feel honoured to have you notice me long enough to be disgusted by me." Clementine recited, her body numb with humiliation. The party laughed at the total destruction of their foes standing.</p>
<p>"There we go." John cheered. "Now I don't know about you guys but I feel disgusted having this dirty animal wandering my party. Henry, Charlie, grab some rope, we're going to tie this bitch to the front gate." A couple of men jumped at John's instruction as he dragged Clementine to the door by her hair.</p>
<p>Badiha watched on with a mixture of concern and pride. It wasn't an ideal situation, but at the moment her plan was working.</p>
<p>"You can untie her at midnight." John informed Badiha as he and his entourage strolled out into the night and towards the street.</p>
<p>After Clementine had been tied to the front gate and abandoned to her exposure, the party fizzled fast. There were now additional suspicions aimed at all the remaining waitresses which added an edge not conducive to the light-hearted fun that had come before. Gradually the guests all began to leave, naturally building in a bit of time to torment Clementine when they were on their way out of the door.</p>
<p>By the time the clock struck midnight, the party had cleared out and Badiha went and untied Clementine, she was silent as they walked back to the house.</p>
<p>"So before I update you on the plan, how are you feeling?" Badiha asked, fetching Clementine her clothes and a cup of coffee, both of which sat to one side undisturbed as she processed her evening.</p>
<p>"I always wondered what it would be like to be in one of your adventures. I'm sure I would have found it exhilarating if we just left it at me being a naked waitress for the night without the escalation, huge stakes and horrific plans. Everything with John was a bit over the top, although I think I could have handled it better if it hadn't been my first jaunt with humiliation." She explained, trying to reconcile her horniness and fear into words.</p>
<p>"Well I'm afraid you will have more time to get used to it. John thinks I've turned against you, people who live in that kind of world are blind to anything other than the constant struggle between self-interested actors. So I don't think he will suspect that given the opportunity I would restore you to your former position and won't be on his guard. So yes, you will be selling your body for a bit, but it's going to buy you the time you need. Not having to plan how to stay ahead of people who want to destroy you now means you have time to plan your return, and I will provide you with the resources John now thinks you lack." Badiha explained.</p>
<p>"So this was everything going to plan?" Clementine asked.</p>
<p>"I thought he would just rip the PVC mask rather than picking the lock, but I expected most of what happened. I'm sorry this is what was required." Badiha continued to explain. Clementine grabbed the coffee and drained it in one gulp.</p>
<p>"That's alright. I have done worse to stay out of danger. You never know, I might find a way to enjoy my temporary new career."</p>
<p>"That's the spirit." Grace announced from the corner, earning herself a glare from Clementine. Although Badiha vouched for Grace and insisted she was part of the planning, Clementine seemed to take out on Grace her annoyance of Badiha's sense of trust, widening circles of knowledge she felt was unnecessary.</p>
<p>While she sorted out a place for Clementine to live, Badiha had once again found herself sharing her home with someone who had no place to go. Sharing space with Clementine while she was going through this process was a strange prospect, Clementine had taken her brief of becoming a sexual deviant to heart and was agressively yet dispassionately training herself. Badiha would wake up to Clementine naked and looming above her with a breakfast in bed.</p>
<p>"Just getting used to being submissive." She would state before returning to clean up the kitchen. It was like living with a method actor starring in a movie made by a pervert.</p>
<p>After some time Grace came over so they could get to work checking the emails for new clients while also doing routine maintenance on the couple of slow burn clients they still had running in the background. Henrietta had more than reached her goal of earning money as an influencer but still found herself checking in for new confidence boosting tasks, while other girls in long term arrangements needed groundwork laid for schemes Badiha and Grace had concocted.</p>
<p>The emails now required another level of analysis, it was about figuring out which contact would be most useful in helping Clementine rather than the usual affair of just picking which fantasy had the cleanest exit for the biggest payoff. Clementine sat with them to help, but chose to begin every thought she had with "I'm just a stupid bitch but..." Badiha was relieved when she got dressed and announced that she was off to fuck her first of many paying clients.</p>
<p>Once Clementine was gone, Badiha sighed and closed her laptop.</p>
<p>"What we need is a bit more specific than we can get just waiting for someone to email us. We need to go on the offensive." She sighed. "How would one go about seeking out a deviant who would want our services?"</p>
<p>Badiha sat as much in the corner as Starbuck's backless stools and circular tables would allow, opting to wear some big sunglasses to put John more at ease as he sat down with a coffee he had no plans to drink. It was surreal having a member of parliament give her a big hug as a cover to pat her down and whirr around a device that was looking for bugs. Once satisfied John sat down and Badiha slid a cheque across the table. John quietly slid it into his pocket, after checking the amount married with his intel on how many people Clementine had slept with.</p>
<p>Badiha was filled with a new sense of caution after hearing Clementine's stories of her time with John. Unlike her other clients John never had sex with her. His penis stayed firmly in his pants, any time she asked for him to fuck her, he would laugh, call her a dumb whore and think up of a new punishment. It soon became clear John's vice was not lust, it was wrath. He felt no joy at the idea of having sex with anyone but his wife, but regular sessions to punish and humiliate his fallen foe gave him an unsettling amount of joy.</p>
<p>"So, any new clients I should be aware of?" John calmly asked.</p>
<p>"Civil servant in the department of transport, going to sway the government to build a new rail route through low yeild farmland I own and will be well compensated for." Badiha replied, giving John insight into a scheme that was not happening, but Clementine knew which buttons to press to make it look like it was. After all it was imperative John did not find out about their newest client, Nym.</p>
<p>"I forgot how much the nickel and diming of fixers always filled me with disgust and boredom." John yawned, he felt it was important that Badiha knew she was far beneath him on the pecking order. "Don't worry, that isn't stepping on my toes, you go right ahead."</p>
<p>"Thanks, so when do you want Clementine again?"</p>
<p>"I'm having a weekend away with some friends and I was hoping Clementine could provide the entertainment, we'll be in Earlsmere Cottage in the New Forest, Clementine will know where that is. Have her there on the 15th and 16th to entertain my friends, then the 17th and 18th just for me. We'll meet back here on the 24th." John outlined.</p>
<p>"We're meant to rotate the Starbucks." Badiha asserted. John took a long swig of his coffee and only barely kept it down.</p>
<p>"What does it matter, everything is the same, the hard seats, the horrible coffee, I swear I was served by the same teenage dirtbag that every Starbucks seems to have. So if you're going to insist I'm in proximity to this swill, I'm going to need it on my terms. This one is the one closest to my house and it will be where we are meeting from now on, alright?" John insisted.</p>
<p>"You're acting like you have all the power, I can still release the information about your daughter and cause a scandal." Badiha countered.</p>
<p>"Firstly, you're not releasing your only leverage over something as petty as our choice of café. Secondly, you made a huge mistake letting everyone I work with know about that sexual business with my daughter. I am prepared for its release, the only person you would be hurting is her." John explained.</p>
<p>"You wouldn't be that callous to your own daughter." Badiha gasped.</p>
<p>"I'd rather have her be right there with Clementine selling her body to sadists than risk all I've built for some degraded whore." John stated, his level tone very clearly showing this was not a bluff.</p>
<p>"Wow, poor thing." Badiha sadly acknowledged for a moment. "Well, sucks to be her I guess. See you on the 24th."</p>
<p>Nym was a receptionist at a small bio-testing laboratory near Heathrow Airport. They had gotten a whole bunch of funding when COVID made mass testing necessary, but still made some money on the side with a variety of other tests such as DNA testing for genetic disorders, parentage, and criminal investigations.</p>
<p>Most of their contracts came in through smooth business liaisons visiting big offices and then coming back with the date and amount of deliveries the lab techs would be processing, but the owner was an old fashioned man who still believed in having a front of house for clients to come in off the street and speak to a receptionist. Nym had seen four potential customers since she started work over a year ago and only one who followed through on asking for a DNA test on his daughter which only came back positive for him being a paranoid, untrusting asshole just because his kid was uglier than he wanted.</p>
<p>To keep herself busy, Nym had established herself as a general dogsbody to the lab techs that frequented the laboratory her tiny vestigial reception office seemed to have been bolted onto. She fetched coffees, took lab coats to the cleaners, ordered takeaways, light filing and admin work, basically all the helpful things someone could do without specialist scientific training. In-between these requests she spent all her time on her phone, either playing innocent games or consuming huge amounts of far less innocent porn.</p>
<p>One service Nym provided, the kind she especially looked forward to, was the unofficial office tradition of 'nooners.' Ever since the COVID money started rolling in, the lab was able to pay for a bunch of automation technology. So these days the lab techs jobs would be flurries of activity setting up tests followed by hours waiting for machinery to go through the labourious processing routines. So the lead tech came up with the idea that if they coordinated their setup routines, they could all start their automated processes at the same time, then go to a nearby pub (or on one occasion a bowling alley.)</p>
<p>Nym had managed to get herself a key place in this scheme, she was the one who stayed behind to forward on calls, pretend people were still in the office, and generally cover for the team. She explained away her eagerness by charging the lab techs a fee for her 'nooner cover' and pleading poverty. But the truth was that there was nothing she enjoyed more than having the whole building to herself during the day.</p>
<p>It was never the same experience twice when Nym was left alone at the office, but the first step was always to strip off all of her clothes. Sometimes she would be content with simply doing her job naked, going through the motions while living her naturist fantasies of what life would be like if she could be naked all the time. However, if the nooner had plenty of notice and Nym had time to prepare, she often liked to traverse the boundary between naturist and exhibitionist. Instead of simply existing naked, she would plan elaborate scenarios where her clothes would be beyond her reach, or the risk of discovery would be turned up to eleven. That was indeed the plan for today's nooner.</p>
<p>Nym hadn't dwelt too much on how perfect the circumstances were this time round, the lead tech had given her a whole week's notice on the nooner, and had even arranged for go-karting followed by a pub that would last until after the end of office hours on a Friday afternoon, so Nym was also to close down everything and lock up when she was done. She had essentially been given all the time in the world to plan for an exhibitionist adventure that could pretty much last as long as she wanted, and for Nym the planning was just as arousing as the adventure itself. The week was lost to a blur of dark machinations, deep research, and near constant masturbation, until she found herself waving goodbye to her work colleagues as they departed for a go-karting track.</p>
<p>Nym started by untying and retying her shoulder length black hair, her ponytails weren't always the neatest and with the amount of time she was going to spend around moving machinery she needed to make sure it wouldn't get trapped in anything. She then headed towards the employee lockers, on the way glancing at the centrifuge currently whirring away in the background, in about half an hour it would be central to her plan.</p>
<p>Nym was the lowest on the pecking order, and at 5ft 5 she was also the shortest employee, which made everyone comfortable with giving her a floor level locker that she had to bend down to reach. She didn't mind as it meant that once all her clothes were in her arms, she deliberately bent at the hip to place them in her locker, giving an imaginary audience a clear view of her exposure. She locked the locker and took the key, placing it on the side for later.</p>
<p>The next part of the plan involved some items Nym had brought from home, left securely in her handbag back at reception. She entered the room that was to be her post and gazed out onto the street. It was a quiet industrial estate so there was nobody by the glass fronted door to see her in the midst of a sexual frenzy of putting plans into action. Her hard nipples poking straight out from her B-cup breasts, her pussy already glistening from the moisture it was producing, visible from beyond the small thatch of pubic hair that had escaped the clippers after her shower that morning.</p>
<p>Nym rummaged through her bag and found what she was looking for, a collar with a length of chain that attached to handcuffs. At first she used to use this device to cuff her hands in front of her body just to restrict movement, but she had then found if she turned the collar around and ran the chain down her back and between her legs, she could essentially cuff her hands tight against her pussy, with the added benefit of choking herself a little every time she squirmed. She attached the collar and one hand so her other would be free to finish setting up.</p>
<p>Nym's magic wand was a smaller size than the average model, but was no less powerful, and pertinent to her situation had a wrist strap, so she ran the wrist strap over her free hand and let it dangle while she returned to the centrifuge, checking the timer and seeing that there was only a minute left, squealing with anticipation about what was coming.</p>
<p>Nym had decided that once she had cuffed herself together, and with her clothes locked in her locker, she needed somewhere to put the keys. Somewhere they could tease her while being slightly out of reach. Before he left, her boss had set up the centrifuge, which required a stop during the process so two samples could be removed before putting it back on again for another hour for the remaining samples. Nym had been asked to do this and had decided that when the two samples were removed, they would be replaced by test tubes with the keys to her locker and her bonds.</p>
<p>Once set up to run, the only way to stop the centrifuge was with the emergency stop button, but that didn't simply turn it off, it jammed a safety bar into the gears to immediately stop it from spinning. At the speed the centrifuge was going this would definitely break it. So if Nym needed an emergency exit, the cost was having to explain to her boss how she ended up breaking a very expensive piece of equipment and ruining the tests it was currently conducting, most likely an explanation she would have to repeat to the ire of their clients. This would probably mean she would not be allowed to cover nooners ever again, if she somehow kept her job.</p>
<p>The centrifuge whirled to a stop and with her one free hand, magic wand dangling from it, Nym managed to remove the two samples she had been instructed to and replace them with the test tubes containing the keys to her freedom. She placed them in the centrifuge and set it on its one hour cycle. She then turned on the magic wand, feeling its vibrations running up the handle, before lowering her hand and clicking the last part of her puzzle into place.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>Nym was now stuck, she would be spending an hour naked with her hands cuffed together, a vibrating wand inches from her pussy. She tried to keep herself together, but only lasted until she sat down in her seat in reception and immediately pressed the wand against her clit. Sat at her desk, her joy swirled with a plan well executed so she could enjoy this singular moment of an illicitly stolen orgasm, her workplace reduced to the stage for her debauched desires.</p>
<p>Nym calmed down a bit after the first wave of orgasms, she was trapped like this for some time and couldn't spend every moment masturbating, but the buzzing wand so close to her intimates was a constant reminder that she could fall to pleasure at her discretion. She stood up and walked around, the chain from the collar rolling between her buttcheeks with every step. She made sure her sexualised body became a presence in every room, from the well decorated manager's offices to the men's toilets, occasionally stopping to edge herself with the vibrator but not fall to an orgasm again until her walk was done.</p>
<p>Nym sat back down in her reception area, the office chair giving her a bit of trouble with her hands cuffed in place. As she sat down her mouse jiggled, clearing the corporate screensaver. For someone as on edge as Nym, a sudden change in her surroundings startled her and she jumped to her feet, knocking her office chair over.</p>
<p>"Shit" Nym cursed to herself as she began a labourious process of trying to pick up her office chair with her hands tied in front of her. She started by trying to maneuver it with her legs, occasionally gripping whatever bit she could, the wand inexpertly vibrating against whatever skin the chair pressured it into.</p>
<p>"You need a hand?" Asked an Asian woman waiting at reception.</p>
<p>"Oh no thanks I..." Nym absentmindedly began before realising the situation she was in and interrupting herself with a scream of humiliated fear. "Holy shit, I am so sorry, please don't tell my boss..."</p>
<p>"Relax, I'm no narc. You actually have been incredibly lucky to be discovered by me." Badiha reassured. Nym didn't need to know that Badiha had painstakingly hacked and surveilled a series of laboratories looking for anything that could get her in. One common lead was to hack into the office WiFi and check if anyone was using it to download porn. Then she would check other internet histories to try and find details that could be used. After months of searching, Badiha finally found Nym's internet history of accessing exhibitionism porn, posting on forums, and even DMs with others talking about the adventures she planned and her experience with nooners. Once she had that, it did not take much to manipulate the situation to engineer this meeting.</p>
<p>"Why am I lucky?" Nym sniffed, tears starting to form in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Because my job is actually to curate experiences such as the one you are currently in. I was hoping to bribe you for a favour, but instead how about I help you scratch this itch of yours better than anything you have ever experienced?" Badiha offered.</p>
<p>"What? I met you 30 seconds ago and you expect me to let you have your way with me?" Nym yelled, stepping back from this strange woman.</p>
<p>"I admit I may have come on a bit strong but it is all the truth. I want a favour from you, so you know I won't let you be harmed, arrested, or fired. Hell, I'll even throw in the bribe at the end so you don't feel like you're missing out." Nym's face softened, Badiha knew very well the expression of someone whose curiosity was beginning to overtake their sensible incredulity.</p>
<p>"So you're a pimp?" Nym asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing so crude. Basically you are far from being the only woman with strange desires. Don't get me wrong you are still an extreme minority, but there are at least enough of you that some are wealthy, and they pay me to hide their clothes, or tie them up, or generally organise for them to be in deviant predicaments." Badiha explained.</p>
<p>"Suppose I believe you. Clearly I don't need your help."</p>
<p>"I can see you have some insight, but I have resources you don't. With the right phone calls I could have you doing a masked striptease in front of your coworkers, or tied naked deep in the forest, or have you pose for naked photos that will be on billboards around the country by tomorrow morning." Badiha had found her pitch highly erotic, but if anything it has made Nym less interested.</p>
<p>"If I'm being honest that's not what I get out of this. I like planning my own adventures, I don't want to be in control in the moment, but putting my brain to creative situations then watching helplessly as my plan comes together around me, it's like being in the middle of a sexually charged heist movie." Nym explained, surprising herself and Badiha in how comfortable she suddenly was talking about her kinks to this stranger.</p>
<p>"Oh I certainly get that, I also know the best part of a heist movie is when the plan falls apart and the heroes have to think on their feet. What I am offering you is that experience with my personal guarantee it won't end badly." Badiha pitched, seeing Nym really considering her offer. "How much longer is this adventure you have crafted set to last?"</p>
<p>"Probably half an hour, maybe a bit longer." Nym guessed. Badiha nodded and immediately removed her clothes to add gravitas and credulity to her position. Standing naked in front of a stunned Nym, she put her clothes into a neat pile and left them on the reception desk.</p>
<p>"Alright, I will return in half an hour to hear your answer to my proposition." She chirped before walking out of the door naked to leave Nym with her horny thoughts.</p>
<p>When Badiha returned, still naked but now with a backpack full of plans, Nym was lying twitching on the floor behind her reception desk, grunting with frustration. For ten minutes she considered Badiha's offer before she realised that it was a terrible idea, that all consideration was coming from a horny brain that had been edging for some time and needed release. To drive the thoughts from her mind she had pushed the vibrator hard against her clit, then felt the vibrations slow to a stop as the batteries ran dry.</p>
<p>"I accept your proposal, please play with me, make me one of your clients." She growled as Badiha smiled in front of her. Just as she said that, Badiha heard a beeping noise coming from the lab. "That's the centrifuge, sample tubes 1 and 2 contain the keys to these handcuffs and the keys to my locker where my clothes and belongings are."</p>
<p>"Ooh, neat." Badiha announced, skipping past the reception into the lab. As Nym was facing away from the door, she couldn't see what Badiha was up to, but in her extreme sexual frustration she wished she would hurry up.</p>
<p>Eventually she felt Badiha's arms wrap around her body and moaned in anticipation, she felt something flat and smooth press against her index finger and she was so horny she didn't realise what had happened until Badiha backed away from her. She held up Nym's phone, which she had just unlocked with Nym's fingerprint, and took a picture of her current predicament.</p>
<p>"Nice, now we're going to go on a little adventure, and I'm going to make sure there's lots of pictures for you to remember me by. Of course if there is any resistance I can always send these photos to your contacts, or upload it onto the various social media apps you have here." Badiha taunted, dangling Nym's phone in front of her eyes. She casually walked over to the pile of clothes she had left behind and began redressing. As she did so, she began her explanation to Nym of what was ahead of her.</p>
<p>"So I only had an hour to work on this plan, but I think I've got it all figured out. You and I will have a little adventure while my colleague makes sure nothing bad happens to the lab. Seeing as you like to be involved in your predicaments, think of what is about to happen as an immersive choose your own adventure game. At key stages I will ask what you want to happen next, and as the adventure plays out you can take pride in your input." Badiha pulled Nym to her feet and made sure to take a selfie of herself fully clothed next to her naked captive, while Grace entered the office and got to work picking up the chair to take her seat behind reception.</p>
<p>"So for our first step, do you want to continue to have your hands chained like that, or do you want your hands free for the adventure? I must warn you that the price of freeing your hands is that you must wear a gag."</p>
<p>Nym's mind buzzed, she was in a fog of eroticism, not ready to put together complex thoughts of what route was the best for her. Would this crazy woman be taking her places where having use of her hands would be more important than being able to explain herself? Her captor had promised her that this would 'not end badly' so the adventure couldn't be too public or too risky, right? In the end the annoyance of her dead wand bouncing against her thigh forced her hand.</p>
<p>"Please, gag me and unchain me." Nym asked. Badiha took the key and unlocked Nym's chains, letting her take a quick gasp of relief at her new found mobility before removing a ball gag from her backpack and clipping it onto Nym's face. Nym moaned into her gag as she rubbed her wrists, taking the dead wand off her wrist and casually tossing it to one side.</p>
<p>"Now that you're gagged, I'm going to have to phrase the decisions in a way you can nonverbally respond to. So, nod or shake your head, do you want to leave the office? Bear in mind, if you choose to stay in the office, the rest of your adventure will be livestreamed on a paid subscription only website. That means a small audience not containing anyone you know but a guaranteed audience nonetheless" Badiha explained.</p>
<p>Badiha clearly intended for this to be a challenge of risks Vs consequences for Nym, a small guaranteed audience Vs the chance of greater exposure. But for Nym the choice was a no-brainer. The only calculation her mind made was that venturing out of the office seemed like the most thrilling option and she eagerly nodded her head.</p>
<p>"Alright then, let's head out into the world." Badiha announced, linking arms with Nym and strutting towards the front door, briefly pausing to toss a casual wave to Grace on the way out of the door.</p>
<p>It wasn't too cold outside, but that didn't stop a gust of wind whipping around Nym's naked body and sending a shudder of goosebumps over her exposed skin. Nym had ventured out of the office naked once or twice when she had been on nooner duty, but they would always be a game of chicken with herself venturing as far out of the office as she could stomach before either her fear or her lust overcame her and she'd rush back to the office for cover or toys. Badiha scanned the quiet industrial estate, half the buildings were currently unoccupied and what remained were gutted of staff by Friday afternoon early leavers and work from homers so only a few cars remained indicating a quiet empty space occasionally flooded with the sound of low flying airplanes above.</p>
<p>"Alright Nym, my car is parked nearby...ish. Your options are the following. Either you walk with me to come get the car, or I leave you tied to that lamppost while I go and get it. Nod to come with me, shake your head to be tied to the lamppost." Badiha offered. Nym didn't mind being tied up but the thrill of a journey was far more her speed, forging forwards, ever getting further from safety and wondering what was around each corner, she nodded pretty much as soon as Badiha had finished talking.</p>
<p>"Nice, come with me then." Badiha chirped, confidently strutting ahead while Nym awkwardly skipped behind, switching between fearfully forcing her hands to her sides and covering herself with each distant sound of gust of wind. Badiha turned a corner and suddenly Nym was in an unfamiliar avenue of the industrial estate, she usually parked her car right next to her building and the food trucks and grocery shops were in a completely different direction.</p>
<p>"Alright, I think it's time for another decision." Badiha announced turning to Nym. "It's still a bit further to my car, your first option is that I give you my key and you wander the industrial estate alone trying to figure out which car is mine. The other option is that I could lead you to the car myself, however if I do that you will be leashed and blindfolded."</p>
<p>Nym once again thought through the options Badiha had given her. If she chose the first it would tantalizingly draw out her predicament, forcing her to be in proximity to everyone's cars so she could keep pressing the clicker and keep an eagle eye out for the flashing lights, but she didn't know how long it would go on for, and the more intense offer of a blindfolded dog walk seemed so much more direct and salacious. She grunted around the gag to demonstrate her preference for the second option.</p>
<p>Badiha got the leash and collar out of her backpack and fastened it around Nym's neck, recognising her moan of contented fear. Then she placed the blindfold over Nym's eyes and left her for a cruel amount of time, stood in exposed darkness, before picking up the leash and giving her a light tug forward.</p>
<p>Badiha maintained a slight pressure on the leash pulling Nym relentlessly but cautiously slowly forward. Each step she took Nym fell further into the swirling darkness of deviant submission. She pricked her ears for any sound of a potential audience but all she could hear was the click of Badiha's shoes occasionally punctuated by the roar of a plane overhead.</p>
<p>As Nym kept going forward on her unyielding journey, she heard another sound that made her skin fizzle with degraded expectation, the roar of a car's engine. It was close, very close, her mind raced at where she could be and if it possible for a car to pass so close without seeing her. The roar of questions resolved themselves when Nym heard the car honk it's horn repeatedly before driving away.</p>
<p>"Mmm" Nym groaned into her gag.</p>
<p>"Yes, that car was honking at your naked body." Badiha answered. "I wonder if this one will honk as well?"</p>
<p>As she said that another roar of an engine approached and Nym jumped on the spot as it honked its horn at her exposed body.</p>
<p>"How does it feel to know that between 2 and 10 people have just seen you naked and being led through a car park like a dog on a leash?" Badiha asked. Nym didn't know how she would have responded even if she wasn't gagged so just moaned with approval as she carried on her journey.</p>
<p>There were no more roars of mobile audiences before Nym heard the telltale beep of a car being remotely unlocked.</p>
<p>"Alright we're here" Badiha informed, ripping the blindfold off Nym's face. "Get in."</p>
<p>Nym climbed into the passenger seat of Badiha's car, a spacious Mercedes-Benz with leather seats, and awkwardly fastened her seatbelt around her bare breasts.</p>
<p>"So where do you want to go?"</p>
<p>"Mmm."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, you're gagged, guess I'll have to give you some options then." Badiha got out Nym's phone and browsed through its contents as Nym awkwardly watched on. "So do you want to go to a go-kart track or to a bar?"</p>
<p>Nym took a moment to think through what had been offered, she knew her work team had discussed going go-karting then to the pub afterwards, Badiha was clearly testing her on how much time had passed. Whether or not her coworkers saw her naked body was based on if she thought she had been indulging this perverse fantasy of hers long enough that they would have finished go-karting. The frustration had been piling up within her and being faced with having to make these sorts of decisions seemed harsh, but she had to admit if she had been running the show, she would have orgasmed and finished up long ago, she needed someone to push her like this. Nym grunted a clearly multisyllabic series of words that Badiha took to mean go-karting.</p>
<p>"Alright, let's go go-karting." Badiha announced, starting the car. Nym squirmed in her seat as Badiha did nothing to prevent passersby from seeing her. Several cars pulled alongside to see Badiha's exposed thrall breathing increasingly heavy with the thrill of exposure and the thought of what lay ahead.</p>
<p>Nym was not to know that it was no accident that her office has gone go-karting. Her boss had received an email very special offer on go-karting in the week before the nooner, organised by Badiha to ensure they went to the track she had rented out for the day, partly so she could keep an eye on them, partly so if Nym chose this option she could guarantee no kids would be there and nobody would take advantage of the situation. All the other go-karters had been a selection of her contacts and friends that she knew she could trust and the staff had all been thoroughly bribed/threatened.</p>
<p>Nym got out of the car and felt her feet get heavier and heavier as she got closer to the entrance, Badiha could feel her resolve slipping and grasped her arm for support. They walked into the reception area together and the man behind the counter's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>"Can I help you?" He stuttered.</p>
<p>"Maybe you can." Badiha announced, taking charge of the situation. "My friend and I would like to go go-karting please."</p>
<p>"We usually insist on safety equipment here, helmet, gloves and boiler suit." He explained.</p>
<p>"Certainly, although would it be OK if my friend skipped the boilersuit?" Badiha asked and Nym was shocked to see the man behind the counter agree. As Badiha began to squirm into the blue safety boilersuit, Nym pulled on her gloves, then pulled the helmet over her head, feeling not much safer than before.</p>
<p>Badiha led Nym through the reception out to the loud echoey sound of roaring engines around an empty warehouse. A race was currently in progress and Nym immediately studied the lap time monitors to see if there were any names she recognised. The monitors were giving first names only, there were some common names that she did recognise but it was just as likely to be someone else than someone she knew, plus there were more names that none of her coworkers had. As Badiha lead Nym to the waiting area, she became certain it wasn't her work colleagues on the go-karts.</p>
<p>Because they were also in the waiting area.</p>
<p>"Hi everyone!" Badiha chirped, turning all eyes to her, and then immediately to the naked woman she had just walked up arm in arm with. Nym felt her whole body seize up as her work colleagues all studied her naked body and began to laugh and comment on this exhibitionist that had just joined their party. "So how are you guys enjoying go-karting?"</p>
<p>"Well we certainly weren't expecting this." One of the young nerdy lab interns replied as he enjoyed Nym's squirming exposure.</p>
<p>"Are you serious? That is disgusting." The chemical engineer sneered, she had always been so nice to Nym, relishing another woman at this male dominated field, but now she was looking at her like her naked body had just set back modern feminism by twenty years.</p>
<p>It was only after these comments that Nym realised they didn't recognise her. The helmet she had been forced to wear was shielding her identity, she had thought her life was over but Badiha had figured out how to naturally conceal her identity.</p>
<p>"Now the reason this young lady is all naked and humiliated is that she lost a bet with me. How would you guys like to help us do a new bet?" Badiha asked with mixed responses from her audience. "I'll let her choose the loser's forfeit of course, she can either give the winner of the race a kiss on the podium, or she can do something crazy like do a naked lap of the track leashed to a go-kart with her hands cuffed behind her back."</p>
<p>Badiha couldn't see the admiring scowl Nym was giving her below the helmet and around the gag. The trick she had played was masterful, removing her helmet to give her work colleague a kiss was unthinkable, but her work colleagues didn't know that. If she took the safer option she would look more deviant through her choice. Nonetheless Nym didn't know how good Badiha was at go-karting and decided not to risk it. She held up two fingers to indicate the second option and the audience of her coworkers reacted appropriately.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Five minutes later Nym found herself climbing into a go-kart, her stomach filled with churning nerves. As she sat on the seat, the vibrations from the engine started to rattle through her frame. She gripped the steering wheel hard and found herself moaning with each rev of the engine. At the drop of the green flag she pressed her foot to the pedal and powered off alongside her fellow racers, but the intense vibrations mixed with all her frustrations up to that point and she practically crashed at the first corner with her body wildly spasming from her orgasm.</p>
<p>Nym couldn't believe the situation she was in, she desperately needed to win but she had spent the first few minutes bouncing off all the walls while she orgasmed. She worried if she went too fast the vibrations, the prickle of cold air on her skin, the rush of excitement, it would continue to have such a profound effect on her. The only saving grace was that this was Badiha's first time go-karting and it showed, even with her main opponent's mind clouded by waves of pleasure wracking through her body, Badiha was only able to get a half lap lead before the fog raised and Nym began racing.</p>
<p>Nym couldn't believe the frustrating tightrope she had to walk, every time she began to catch up on Badiha, she felt a familiar wellspring inside of her and she had to slow down and take some deep breaths to keep herself from going over the edge. It didn't help that every time one of her work colleagues passed her they would clearly slow down to give her a good look, all except the chemical engineer who was still disgusted by the whole thing.</p>
<p>Eventually Nym managed to get in a rhythm that kept her head clear, but by then she had accepted that she would not be able to catch up with Badiha before the checkered flag would signal the end of her dignity. She turned a corner and her eyes bulged with a sudden discovery. The chemical engineer had deliberately rammed into Badiha's go-kart, knocking her into a barrier and keeping her from getting out. Nym's mouth hung open as she calmly drove passed the accident and then crossed the line on her final lap, she'd somehow won.</p>
<p>Everyone except the chemical engineer was disappointed, including Nym. She slunk out of her car to empty cheers and congratulations as Badiha joined her chuckling.</p>
<p>"Well you can't win 'em all eh?" Badiha shrugged. "How about another race, double or nothing?"</p>
<p>"Oh absolutely." A particularly pervy biochemist agreed. "Just as soon as you've done your forfeit."</p>
<p>Nym actually let a smile creep onto her face as she saw the shock in Badiha's eyes. Everyone agreed that the bet was whoever lost would be doing a lap of dishonour. The chemical engineer was in shock, she had rammed Badiha off the road to stop this perverse game, but despite Badiha's mild objections she had simply moved it on to another. Badiha peeled off her boiler suit, and then began to remove the rest of her clothes.</p>
<p>"I'm going home." The chemical engineer sneered, her objections barely heard above the cheer of the remaining audience as Badiha freed her E-cup tits from her bra. A couple other members of staff who were uncomfortable with the impromptu strip show also decided to leave before Badiha peeled her knickers down her legs to reveal her shaved pussy to the group.</p>
<p>Badiha cheekily rolled her eyes as she picked up her bag and removed the collar and leash she had led Nym through the car park with earlier, and the handcuffs she had saved for a special occasion. The audience agreed it was only fair that Nym drive the go-kart, then proceeded to assist in setting up Badiha's degrading walk while Nym got settled back in the driver's seat.</p>
<p>The employee had never envisioned his day would contain a moment where he dropped a checkered flag so that a naked woman could rev up her engine and begin slowly dragging another naked woman round his track by a leash. The gathered audience cheering at the humiliation of a vanquished foe as Nym took this opportunity to occasionally lurch forward and cause her conquest to comically stumble.</p>
<p>On the first long stretch she looked back and was able to see the smile on Badiha's face and the bounce in her breasts with every step the leash bid her to take. Deep down Nym felt a wellspring of envy at Badiha's humiliating exposure. She found herself beginning to accelerate, forcing Badiha into a jog, her unsupported E-cup breasts beginning to bounce uncomfortably and the smile beginning to fade.</p>
<p>Nym turned a corner and had to restrain herself from speeding up further. Causing this level of discomfort in her tormentor was fun but it would certainly put a damper on the whole event if she fell over and hurt herself on the hard tarmac. Nevertheless she kept her prisoner at a steady jog to let her know who was in charge.</p>
<p>The crowd cheered as a sweaty, out of breath Badiha turned into her final straight. At this point Nym allowed herself one more rebellious prank, parking the go-kart five metres from the finishing line, then joining in with her work colleagues laughing at Badiha straining to cross the finish line and pleading with her captor to let her finish.</p>
<p>After a few moments Nym lurched over the line, then uncuffed Badiha so she could get to work figuring out how to regain the upper hand.</p>
<p>"Well I did agree to double or nothing, and it looks like all the prudes have left, so how about we ratchet up the forfeit for the loser?" Badiha asked the group, sending tingly sparks coursing through Nym's body. "Person who loses gets tied to the scaffolding behind the podium. If the loser gets lapped once, everyone gets 30 minutes to do whatever they want with their hands, if the loser gets lapped twice, the time goes up to 1 hour and you get access to my bag of toys here, and if you lap the loser 3 times, she will take off her helmet."</p>
<p>"Wait, do we know her?" One of the audience asked, making Nym's body heat up with embarrassment.</p>
<p>"Well I hope you don't think the helmet was a fashion statement. This lady is a celebrity, if you lap her three times you'll have the tabloid scoop of the century." Badiha lied.</p>
<p>"That's her forfeit for losing, what if you lose?" The biochemist asked.</p>
<p>"Same outcome for the first 2 lappings I guess," Badiha thought aloud. "If I lose and you lap me a third time I'll give you my clothes, my bag, and my car. I will be left naked with absolutely nothing and have to figure out for myself what to do next." The murmurs from the audience of Nym's coworkers were loud and palpable. As the group were once again shepherded to the go-karts, Badiha took Nym to one side for a quiet conversation.</p>
<p>"This is your adventure not mine." Badiha began, "I think deep down you will be disappointed if you don't end up tied to the scaffolding for your coworkers lust. So when I say this it is for your own good; if you beat me in this race, I will get all the pictures I have taken with your phone and upload it on every social media app you have installed."</p>
<p>Badiha opted not to put her clothes back on, joining Nym in racing wearing nothing but gloves and a helmet. Once again they found themselves sitting in a go-kart, the vibrations of the revving engines flowing through their exposed bodies. The green flag dropped and the karts sped off. This time it was Badiha who was overwhelmed by the feeling of wind rushing against her exposed skin. While Nym was able to remain calm from previous experience Badiha crashed into the wall at the first corner and Nym sped by.</p>
<p>Nym now had a conundrum, she couldn't race away without photos of her deviation ending up on all her accounts, but if she slowed down to let Badiha catch up, she would be allowing her coworkers to catch up and potentially lap her too many times. She opted for a middle ground approach where she lingered at the back of the pack and hoped Badiha would get her shit together.</p>
<p>Then she saw Badiha crash again.</p>
<p>"Fucking hell." Nym swore to herself, as she swerved the wrong way and deliberately crashed into a wall, slowly turning the kart around as she saw her colleagues speeding away from her. She looked back and saw Badiha still miles behind, getting lapped by the first of her colleagues and she decided she needed a little courage to do something stupid. She took her left hand off the wheel, with great difficulty peeled off the glove, and began lightly touching herself as she continued her race.</p>
<p>The effect on Nym's lap times was obvious as her focus waned, she would moan with humiliated delight each time a work colleague lapped her, only strengthening her resolve to fiddle with her clitoris. She surrendered herself to yet another degrading orgasm as Badiha finally caught up to her and overtook. She tried to return to reality, but even though Badiha was now speeding away so she didn't have to go slow any more, she couldn't bring herself to remove her hand from between her legs. It wasn't long until the first of her coworkers was lapping her for a second time.</p>
<p>'What if I just let it happen?' She thought to herself, 'what if I just let all my coworkers know that I was the exhibitionist slut they all saw naked, that they all get to play with.' She swum in that thought for a moment, but reality crashed down on her and with great difficulty she put her left hand back on the wheel.</p>
<p>A newly refocused Nym was not terrible at go-karting, she was able to keep pace with the group so nobody else managed to get that second lapping. It was only when she had caught back up with Badiha that she once again slowed and her coworkers began to pass her again. As she raced she kept an eye on the man in the blue jumpsuit with the red trim. She didn't even know who it was, just that he was in the lead, rapidly gaining on her, and maybe able to lap her that unspeakable third time if she didn't do something drastic.</p>
<p>Nym started bumping Badiha, trying to get her to drive faster, but Badiha had decided to make this go down to the post as close as possible. In the penultimate lap he was right behind them and gunning it. Nym was between a rock and a hard place, either she avoided that third lap by overtaking Badiha and getting her naked humiliation plastered all over the internet, or she gets overtaken and her work life would be over.</p>
<p>In a drastic moment of clarity, Nym took action. She jerked her steering wheel to one side and slammed into the man behind her, crashing them both into a wall and blocking his path with her car. She gave Badiha enough time to pull away before she saw second place approaching fast and decided to race off.</p>
<p>Now the game was really on, Nym had to go one lap without being overtaken by the two fastest racers both now on her tail. All thoughts of her wind-prickled skin and hungry pussy became lost to the exhilarating race. She pressed hard, swerving all over the road to block any route for overtaking. It was her fastest lap and she managed to hold them at bay. She let out a scream of jubilation as she crossed the line with the other racers still behind her.</p>
<p>Nym was so relieved that her identity was safe, she forgot for a moment what she was on the hook for. She remembered when she pulled into the pit lane and saw a gathering of her coworkers looking over her with malicious smiles. She didn't struggle as they lifted her out of the driver's seat and led her towards the scaffolding around the podium, Badiha already waiting with a collection of cable ties in her hands.</p>
<p>Nym turned around and felt the cold metal of the scaffold press against her back as she stretched her arms wide and felt the uncompromising compression of the plastic ties bind her wrists apart.</p>
<p>At first her coworkers just watched her squirm, a universe of possibilities ahead of them but still a veneer of respectability holding them back. That veneer was thoroughly removed when Badiha took her bag and upended it in front of her tied client. Nym looked down and could not believe so much could fit in such a small bag.</p>
<p>There was a wand; larger and more powerful than Nym's dead device, a small leather flogger, a variety of brightly coloured pens, a remote control egg, some vibrating anal beads, some lube, and some nipple clamps on a chain, some suction cups, and some devices even Nym didn't recognise.</p>
<p>"Your hour starts now." Badiha announced, pressing a button on her phone to start a timer.</p>
<p>As expected the pervy biochemist was the first to approach her, grabbing a red pen and using it write 'loser' in big letters across Nym's chest. He then began to roughly knead her breasts while the rest of the group decided what they were going to do with the other toys. The lead tech didn't partake, but instead got his phone out to get ample pictures and recordings of Nym's use.</p>
<p>Nym moaned and squirmed as the pervy biochemist pressed himself against Nym to get a better grab on her bottom, his hands roughly grabbing her cheeks while an errant finger brushed against her anus. A different coworker whispered in Badiha's ear and Badiha found herself having to clarify something to all gathered.</p>
<p>"Just as an FYI, no fucking. Nobody here wants to see your penis, I don't have any condoms, and I don't know where you've been. Just use the toys provided."</p>
<p>Another of Nym's coworkers grabbed the flogger, then advanced, pushing the pervy biochemist to one side, running the leather tassels up and down Nym's heaving body, before pulling back and whipping it down across her breasts.</p>
<p>The leather on the flogger was soft, it didn't do any damage and it certainly wasn't designed to cause strong pain. What it did was give Nym the certain sensation that her body had been whipped. She was tied and at the mercy of her coworkers, and as their will was that her body be whipped, that was what was happening. Each impact sent a wave of pressure out from her prickling skin and she moaned with her dominated sensations. The pervy biochemist tapped his colleague on the shoulder, while the coworker had gotten to work whipping Nym's tits, he had taken the opportunity to get a red pen and had drawn a target on Nym's bottom.</p>
<p>The coworker obliged as soon waves of pressured warmth were emanating from Nym's bottom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the remaining coworkers began sharing round the lube, applying it liberally to every toy in the bag designed for internal use. Nym squirmed on the spot but didn't fight it as the pervy biochemist spread her cheeks for the man carrying the vibrating anal beads. As the first vibrating bead popped past her anus, Nym gasped at the feeling of the egg pushing against her pussy with very little resistance.</p>
<p>The other coworkers set to work making sure Nym's entire lower body was turned into a mess of vibrations and violations. One by one all five beads had been pushed up Nym's bottom, the egg had been inserted and turned up to its highest vibration setting. Then, just as the pervy biochemist had finished writing 'fuck me here' on her pubis, another coworker malevolently approached her with the wand.</p>
<p>The toys didn't need to create vibrations as strong as a go-kart for targeted sensations to radiate, throwing Nym into body-wracking waves of sensations that she swum in, screaming with joy as her coworkers unknowingly gave their receptionist the longest, largest and most degrading orgasm she thought possible.</p>
<p>When she finished swimming in wave after wave of pleasure, Nym was able to come down and return to herself, feeling a sense of finality in the final unraveling of her frustrated adventure. However her smiling coworkers and Badiha's indifference clearly communicated time wasn't up yet.</p>
<p>Grace sat in the reception area of the laboratory, wondering when Badiha and Nym were going to get back. The sun had set and she didn't even need to still be at reception as the lab would have closed at least half an hour ago. She recognised the headlights of Badiha's car pulling up outside the reception, Badiha got out and then opened her passenger door to Nym. Nym was still in a dream world, barely able to walk straight or engage in any other task that required an ounce of concentration. Grace wasn't surprised she was still naked, her clothes were still in a pile next to the desk, but she was surprised at the sheer volume of dirty graffiti covering her body.</p>
<p>"So here are your clothes. How about you get dressed and we give you a lift home. Then we can discuss the favour we want from you." She gently explained.</p>
<p>"Please tell me you're recruiting. I'm sure I could put together a very creative application." Nym mumbled as she tried to return to her senses.</p>
<p>"Not right now, but we do often utilise freelancers such as yourself for other fantasies, so I'll keep you in mind." Badiha diplomatically replied.</p>
<p>Nym giggled as she began to dress herself again.</p>
<p>Grace was hanging out a Badiha's house sharing a glass of wine. They were waiting for Clementine to get back so they could share the good news with her. With Nym in the bag it wouldn't be long until their plan comes to fruition.</p>
<p>When Clementine stormed into the house, the fearful anger on her face was even more noticeable than her recently shaved head.</p>
<p>"Good news!" Badiha announced, trying to ignore Clementine's conspicuous status. "We are owed a favour from someone who works in a laboratory, soon we'll be able to free you."</p>
<p>"How soon?" Clementine snapped sitting down on the sofa.</p>
<p>"Alright, I know this is humiliating for you but we need to do it properly to make sure everything..."</p>
<p>"I don't care about John and his friends shaving my head as a final humiliation after they'd all fucked me, I have thick skin and it will grow back. The problem is John's latest demand." Clementine grabbed the bottle and downed as much wine as she could handle. "He said that as I had dragged his daughter into this, he wanted to drag my daughter into my nightmare."</p>
<p>"Fuck." Grace instinctively responded.</p>
<p>"So please tell me we can get this son of a bitch before that happens." Clementine sneered.</p>
<p>"So now we have the DNA lab, our plan is to fake a DNA test to make it look like John is Grace's father. An affair scandal mixed with him alienating a major financial backer would probably get him removed from any positions of influence so he won't have any backing anymore. Once John is out of the equation nobody's going to continue giving resources to dealing with you." Badiha explained.</p>
<p>"That's your plan? That's your fucking plan? Have you seen the state of the Conservative party? They'll probably promote him if they find out his biggest secret is an affair. He is an MP for a seat that would elect Hitler's bowel movement if it was wearing a blue rosette. You need to crush him, not give him a blush. Fuck!" Clementine rambled, reaching to pull at her hair with frustration, then lashing out and kicking the coffee table when there was no hair to pull. "And you think Grace's father is a big enough financial backer to be a power broker. He isn't even in the top ten funders of that asshole."</p>
<p>"So what do you suggest, we just kill him?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"No, killing him would earn us the ire of his handlers. You were right on the money with reputational damage, a scandal would remove him from power and make it clear it is his fault, shielding us from reprisals, but it needs to be bigger than a simple affair." Clementine reasoned. "It's going to be hard to get him on his sexuality though. This weekend was the first time he deigned to fuck me and that was only because I had stopped asking."</p>
<p>That night they stayed up all night trying to think of something better.</p>
<p>"Badiha!" John announced with the same false joviality he had practiced over the years of networking and chumming to get where he was. Once again he hugged Badiha as a cover to pat her down and whirr his bug tracing device around her. Badiha held her nerve and swallowed her revulsion long enough to then sit down with her coffee. They prepared to chat but then had to sit in awkward silence while a Starbucks employee wiped down the table. Eventually even the minimum wage teenager could sense she was just making the situation more awkward and left.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>"I take it that by now Clementine has informed you of my latest demand?" John smirked.</p>
<p>"Yes, and it's not what we agreed." Badiha shot back.</p>
<p>"All we agreed is that you would keep me happy in exchange for Clementine's life."</p>
<p>"Come on John, you're being unreasonable."</p>
<p>"Once you get past a certain level of power you no longer concern yourself with what's reasonable. In fact there's a pretty strong case that being unreasonable is the only way to get to an obscene level of power. It's certainly all anyone does with such power, reinforce and perpetuate their pathological need to never be told no. So here I am, far more secure and powerful than you, telling you that it doesn't matter how unreasonable my request is. I want to make daughter dearest my whore, and your only response should be 'yes, sir.' Do I make myself clear?"</p>
<p>"How the fuck am I supposed to do that?"</p>
<p>"I'm frightfully sorry but that's not my problem. Although if you don't come through and have mummy and daughter at my Dartmoor summer house by the 1st of the month it will very much be yours." John announced.</p>
<p>"Dartmoor summer house?" Badiha asked as John got up to leave.</p>
<p>"Of course you wouldn't know, I have a private house for these sorts of things, it is a secret location in Dartmoor, not so much an address as grid coordinates. 50.521638,-3.921683, be there first thing in the morning." He ordered as he stood up to saunter out of the Starbucks, leaving behind an untouched cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Even with all her lost status, her fall from powerful fixer to degraded prostitute, Clementine was still good at what she did. She still had her contacts, still knew how to know things before others, and was still able to find out the outcome of Badiha's meeting with John before Badiha had even managed to finish her dejected trudge home.</p>
<p>It's why she had left Badiha a note.</p>
<p>Dear Badiha,</p>
<p>I'm so, so, so, sorry.</p>
<p>In a world of skulduggery and Machievellian scheming, you stayed a woman of honour. I always suspected that one day someone would betray you in these horrible power games that we play, so I strove to prevent that. I worked hard shielding your bright (albeit perverted) corner of the world from the machinations of the amoral (amongst which I used to count myself). I was prepared for the heartbreak on the day I failed, I am still not sure I will ever overcome the sadness that your downfall is to come at my hands.</p>
<p>There is only one thing in my life I would do anything, no matter how unspeakable, to protect, and I'm afraid John zeroed in on her with malicious focus. I know us running away and going into hiding will leave you in an impossible position, believe me if there was any way I could have made this not a choice between you and my daughter I would have.</p>
<p>Once safe I will look into helping you however I can, but I wouldn't rely on it as I won't be doing anything that can put at risk everything I am protecting with my disgraceful actions. The reputation destruction plan was good but we simply didn't have the time to put it together.</p>
<p>I am deeply thankful for everything you have done, everything you have sacrificed for me. I do not hope for your forgiveness, just your understanding.</p>
<p>Badiha crumpled the note in her hand and collapsed on her sofa.</p>
<p>"So, we're going to need to go into hiding then?" Grace asked, having read the letter for herself. Badiha was still sat in the exact same spot on the sofa staring at her feet.</p>
<p>"Clementine is just scared. She still owes me a favour." Badiha mumbled.</p>
<p>"This is no time for that. You can't just hope, you need a plan."</p>
<p>"I have both. But it's going to be unpleasant."</p>
<p>John sat in his Dartmoor farmhouse. Totally off the grid and isolated so he could realise his sadistic desires in private. He looked out on the windswept moor and saw a single black car approaching on the dirt road that broke through the patch of trees separating his estate from the nearest public road.</p>
<p>The car parked up and Badiha sheepishly got out, closing the door behind her.</p>
<p>"I couldn't help notice that your car is absent a bald sex slave about to watch in horror as her daughter gets the same treatment." John drawled, his smile turning to a angry sneer.</p>
<p>"You overplayed your hand." Badiha explained. "Clementine was in your pocket, but now thanks to your greed, Clementine went into hiding again."</p>
<p>"Her coming to you in the first place was an act of desperation, I'm certain recapturing her will be a sinch if even you cannot help her." John cockily noted. "But until then I believe we had an agreement."</p>
<p>"It was more of a threat. Are you seriously going to follow through with that?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely, and you are too. With the resources at my disposal I could have you captured ready for expedition to a foreign prison of my choosing before your car even reaches the main road." John threatened.</p>
<p>Badiha had hoped it wouldn't have to come to this, but she was prepared. She knew it would be far worse than her training on the island, but maybe not by enough that she couldn't handle it.</p>
<p>"Come on in, I had a lot planned for Bella and you're going to go through all of it and worse." He announced opening the door to the farmhouse.</p>
<p>Badiha looked around the rustic building, without any clues as to what John had in store for her, there were no other people, no devices or tools left out, just a well furnished holiday house, kitchen to the left, hallway down the middle, warm lounge to the right.</p>
<p>"You must come see the fireplace." John bid, "it's incredibly large, a roaring fire in there can heat the whole house, and it's big enough that you could put all your clothes into it without any problems." It wasn't an order, it wasn't even a suggestion, it was an exercise in making sure Badiha was clear about John's expectations. She sighed with resignation as she began to remove her clothes.</p>
<p>John was right about the fireplace, Badiha put all her clothes in a pile, then threw the whole pile in at once and the large roaring fire barely sputtered before erasing the last traces of Badiha's only coverings.</p>
<p>"Stand to attention, arms by your sides, eyes on the floor!" He barked. Badiha snapped into position at his command. John then inspected her body, his critical eyes wandering over her vulnerable skin. "I always like to inspect my livestock before I assign them a role."</p>
<p>"It's unfortunate for you that of the women I have had under my complete domination, an overwhelming majority have been middle eastern, it's a quirk of the people I do business with I'm afraid. So your brown cunt is not as exotic in my eyes as a homegrown woman in the less corrupt country I live in." John explained, running his hand over Badiha's pussy to make his point. "Implants are an interesting point, I've only ever had two women with breasts your size under my control, both natural so they didn't have this uniquely slutty shape to them, they were more pendulous. I'm trying to decide if I like you more or less as a result."</p>
<p>"You have the body of someone who used to really take care of herself at the gym but is now starting to slack off." He laughed. There was then a tense silence as he finished his inspection.</p>
<p>"I've decided." John announced. He grabbed Badiha by the hair and dragged her towards the back door. "You disgust me. Your breast implants, your shaved pussy, no sign of embarrassment or shame as I inspect you. That you ever thought yourself worthy of being part of high society is disgusting. You are a sex crazed, subhuman, degenerate. I would compare you to a breeding sow but I would be embarrassed to let my pigs mate with you."</p>
<p>John dragged Badiha out of the back door of his farm house and towards the old barn where Badiha was certain some very unpleasant things were waiting for her.</p>
<p>"So the next few days are going to be an exercise in learning your place, is that clear?" He flung open the small back door to the barn, where a variety of malicious devices awaited. "As you can see this is a semi-active barn. There are some ponies and a couple of herds of sheep roaming the moors that belong to me and often need assistance. Usually I pay people to do the maintenance for me but in your case I'll make an exception."</p>
<p>John walked over to a workbench and picked up a device that looked like a big red pair of pliers with a bar across one end. He picked it up, slotted in a yellow tag, then walked over to Badiha and pushed her head to one side</p>
<p>"I suppose as you are now my property, I should tag you as such. It's good that you already have pierced ears, it makes the process a little less painful."</p>
<p>Badiha yelped as she felt a hot pressure on her ear.</p>
<p>"Of course in the old days the tag itself would have all the information necessary printed on it so everyone could see, but these days it's all chips and apps. Such a shame that I now have to explain to you what I've tagged you with."</p>
<p>"Let me guess, breeding stock?" Badiha interrupted.</p>
<p>"I guess that's what I deserve for getting cheap stupid livestock. Have you not been paying attention? I would be embarrassed to have my animals dirty themselves on your body." John explained, leaning in to whisper for emphasis. "This tag marks you for the slaughterhouse."</p>
<p>Badiha swallowed her nerves, John was clearly talking for dramatic effect, he was a sadist but he was always looking for an angle on a situation and Badiha would be no good to him dead.</p>
<p>"Until then though, let's see your new home." John announced, dragging Badiha by the hair to a row of wooden stalls. "This is where we house sick livestock, appropriate wouldn't you say? In the corner here is a heater, because it gets pretty cold on the moors at night. The only thing you will have to worry about is keeping me happy enough to keep your pen heated. Every time you disobey me, or respond to my command too slowly, or even give me a look I think is disrespectful, the temperature in your new bedroom drops by one level."</p>
<p>Badiha squirmed as John showed her the app on his phone that let him control the heating level. He drank in her fear, she knew that he was playing with her to indulge his sadism and felt playing along was the thing to do. Badiha didn't know everything about John, but she hoped he'd never dominated someone as deviant as her. She'd specifically trained herself to handle the sort of punishment he was about to dish out, hopefully she'd be able to keep herself from snapping long enough...</p>
<p>Badiha trailed off in that thought, long enough for what? Grace was still working on figuring out how to destroy John's reputation, but she had virtually nothing to work with but a few residual favours owed to Badiha. Badiha hoped that Clementine could pull something off, but she had been fighting for her own survival for a while now, keeping herself and Bella safe while also freeing Badiha seemed like a tall order.</p>
<p>"Now then livestock, you've been upright on your back trotters far too long. From now on you are to crawl everywhere on all fours." John ordered. Badiha concluded her dark thoughts and she got onto her hands and knees, someone had to save her, all she had to do was bide her time and hold onto that hope.</p>
<p>"Glad you know your place. Now heel bitch!" Badiha crawled on all fours to John's side and clumsily kept up with him as he led her to the far side of the pens. As she reached the large double doors opened out to look over the moors, she noticed he was veering to one side towards a stool with a small familiar device plugged into the only outside plug socket.</p>
<p>"You must have expected this was coming, you should have seen the look in Clementine's eyes when I used this to take away her humanity." John bragged as he sat down on the stool and picked up the hair clippers. "Kneel in front of me."</p>
<p>Badiha silently obeyed, kneeling on the floor and bracing herself. She stared straight ahead, looking at John's trousers, the rapidly growing tent confirming his deep enjoyment of indulging raw sadism. She stared blankly, occasionally biting her lips to hold back expressing her shame while the clippers ran across her head and strands of her former life fell to the ground by her feet.</p>
<p>"You know this serves lots of purposes that it didn't with Clementine. For her I wanted all the simpering pawns to see their former power broker beaten and humiliated. But for you it's more practical. Without your hair you'll feel even more exposed to the elements if you try to run or earn my ire enough to be sleeping without heating. Also I plan to put you in some pretty hideous situations and don't want to have to constantly clean out any mess clumped in your hair. Although I'd be lying if I said I didn't deeply enjoy the sight of a woman stripped of her dignity, her beauty, her very link to civilised society." John placed the clippers to one side and picked up a razer, a bowl of water, and some shaving cream. Badiha shuddered a little but still didn't allow herself to show her disgrace as John began to lather up her head.</p>
<p>"Did Clementine tell you the story of when I did this with her. She had an audience and some celebratory disgraces of course but that's not what I enjoyed most." John elaborated as he began to run the razer of Badiha's head. "No, the highlight for me was after all that, when I dropped Clementine off after the party. I gave her a tight short dress, the kind low end prostitutes wear, and dropped her a few miles from her house. I stayed nearby and watched the high and mighty Clementine, once so pompous, now walking down on the street eliciting looks of disgust, and far more delicious for me, pity. Sub-human trash for everyone to see."</p>
<p>John rinsed off Badiha's bald head while he shuddered in the memory.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go look at the pictures I took. You aren't going to get all of my time so you're going to have to get used to keeping yourself busy, but I will aid in that effort by giving you tasks. Bring me two buckets of water from the river." John ordered.</p>
<p>Badiha knew enough to know none of her additional questions would be answered. She could see a slight twinge of disappointment in his face that he didn't get to punish her for asking why he wanted the water or where the river is or any other detail that would put her mind at ease. She simply took two buckets and set off in a direction that felt downhill.</p>
<p>When Badiha returned with two buckets weighed down with water, John felt a tinge of pride at his cunning lesson for his latest captive. She now knew how vast the estate was, how far she could walk without encountering another human being, and how cold the whipping winds of the moors could get even during the day. He also channelled the memories of the torture of Sisyphus by upending the buckets over Badiha, rendering pointless the task she had taken all afternoon to achieve. It certainly would have hit Badiha's psyche harder if she hadn't expected him to do that since the moment she filled the buckets.</p>
<p>Dinner was a dog bowl filled with leftover scraps from what John had been eating, it was pretty meager but it was better than nothing, even if John made Badiha eat it straight from the bowl like a dog, laughing the whole time.</p>
<p>John dragged Badiha to the barn and put the heating on in the pen. Badiha had obeyed all his instructions so he decided to let her have a night with full heat, if only to underscore what he had the power to take away. Badiha felt weird pushing all the straw to one side to make herself a nest to sleep in, but she was at least able to get a couple of hours sleep between the periods where she lay awake in worry and fear.</p>
<p>Badiha was rudely awoken early in the morning by John spraying her with a hose, laughing uproariously at her squeals of cold and shock.</p>
<p>"Alright livestock, I have some final preparations for you today before we settle into a pattern for what is to be your new life. So let's start with your eating arrangements." John led Badiha to the middle of a field where a feeding trough had been set up with a storage unit above it and a timer to distribute as small serving of food. The machine made a whirring sound and some pellets dropped out of the machine into the trough.</p>
<p>"Here we go, so when I'm not here to feed you scraps, you'll be eating these pig pellets. I've checked and this brand won't make you ill and most importantly won't fatten you up as long as the serving sizes are kept small. So go ahead, breakfast is served." John maliciously invited.</p>
<p>Badiha took a deep breath before getting down on her hands and knees and sticking her head in the trough to begin crunching away at the pellets.</p>
<p>"Very good piggy, I didn't even have to order you not to use your trotters." John congratulated, before having a nasty thought. "I didn't have to order you, did I? You just found your natural place as an animal. God, the thought of when I was drinking coffee with you, talking to you like you were a human, it fills me with revulsion."</p>
<p>Badiha felt she could handle these pellets, they tasted like a greasy oatmeal that had been hardened to a soft pill. It certainly felt less horrible than the volley of hard swats John unleashed on her bottom as he vented his frustrations.</p>
<p>"Alright my red rumped whore, we're going to record my insurance policy, lay down some ground rules, then leave you to become acquainted with your new life." John explained, leading Badiha back to the barn.</p>
<p>John sat her down on the stool he had been sitting on when he had sheared her head, Badiha could still see some clumps of her hair on the ground that had escaped being blown away in the night. He then went and fetched a camera to point directly at Badiha's exposure.</p>
<p>"So this video is going to be you looking directly into camera and telling a future audience how you consent to, and even enjoy, being treated like inhuman garbage. Make sure to keep a big grin on your face and really think through what you want to say, your heating goes down by one setting each time I have to do another take." John elaborated as he took his position, camera pointed straight at Badiha's humiliation. Badiha took a deep breath in and tried to find the mental place she had been in when she was Cunt on that Scottish Isle. She couldn't lapse into it through being forced into four word sentences, she needed to immediately become the happy whore she knew was deep inside of her.</p>
<p>"Hello!" She began with a big grin across her face. "My name is Badiha Sehgal, at least that's what people who think I am a human being call me. But people who know the real me have lots of names for me; Slut, Filth, Bitch, Sex Meat. These are all applicable and I love each and every one of them. John saw what a cock hungry fuck pig I am, and granted my greatest wish to become the single-minded livestock I was always destined to become. He gave me a safe word and I hope to forget it as my mind degrades into a mush of sex crazed animalism. Anyone who is worried about me, don't be, I am becoming the sub-human sex slave I always dreamed of being."</p>
<p>"Very good. I'm pretty sure my career could survive anything, but I'd rather defend being a kinky adulterer than a rapist." John smiled as he held up the memory card that held Badiha's confession. "So I have some big important things to do in a world you're not a part of any more. I'll be locking up the house but keeping the barn unlocked so you can sleep and maintain yourself there. This place deliberately doesn't have anything with an outside connection so I can't monitor you, however you don't know when I'll be back so I'm going to give you a schedule and you will have to keep to it. If I come back and you are not doing what you should be, you better get ready for a lot of very cold nights."</p>
<p>Badiha waited awkwardly as John got out a piece of paper and began scribbling some things down. Then he hung it under the clock in the barn and stood back to drink in Badiha's fear as she saw her new life listed for her.</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>9am: breakfast is served.</p>
<p>9.30am: wash yourself with the hose, every third day use the razer and the shaving cream to ensure you do not have a single hair on your body.</p>
<p>10am: dig up one wheelbarrow full of earth from the side of the road and move to a pile next to the barn.</p>
<p>12am: lunch is served.</p>
<p>12.30am: pull the manual lawnmower around all cut lawns.</p>
<p>3pm: rake up all lawn cuttings.</p>
<p>4pm: dinner is served.</p>
<p>4.30pm: go to the river and refill a bucket of water for drinking the next day.</p>
<p>Badiha had a feeling that John was not entirely prepared for her arrival and had rushed the list. It was more important to him that she had some menial tasks to fill her days than what those tasks actually were. For days Badiha's master was a sheet of paper on the wall, filling her life with mindless busy work. Sometimes when she was digging a hole next to the road, she wondered if a car would drive by and see her bald and degraded, but John clearly knew how rarely people drove close to his estate and wanted to rub in how isolated Badiha was.</p>
<p>Every so often John would give Badiha a cold night in the barn, just to remind her that she was still at the whims of his sadism, but apart from that Badiha felt her mind descend into the mush of menial boredom that blurred one day into another.</p>
<p>She didn't know how long she had been there when one day she saw a car approaching. She was unloading another wheelbarrow of dirt next to the barn when the rumble of an approaching engine knocked her out of her monotony. A bright red Porsche pulled up to the barn, and Badiha flinched at the sound of a familiar voice squealing in surprise.</p>
<p>"Badiha." Bella yelled. "I'm so sorry, I had no idea my mother threw you under the bus like that."</p>
<p>"Bella? Does this mean you found a way to take John down?" Badiha asked as Bella grabbed her into a big hug.</p>
<p>"No, it means I'm not going to leave you to this madman like my mother did."</p>
<p>"Bella, no." Badiha pleaded. "Putting yourself through this won't fix anything. John is never placated; he always wants more."</p>
<p>"I have made a deal with John. He gets me for a week, as he asked for, then he will let me and you go and go back to the old arrangement with my mother." Bella explained.</p>
<p>"How do you know John will keep his word and let you go?"</p>
<p>"Because this has always been about hating my mother, she doesn't come back to the fold until we're free."</p>
<p>"What if your mother tries something?"</p>
<p>"She doesn't know where this place is, John keeps its location tightly locked down."</p>
<p>"And you're prepared to go through all this, look at me, I'm shaved, degraded, dehumanised. In ten minutes time that trough is going to dispense a serving of pig feed that is to be my lunch. This is dark stuff and if you aren't mentally prepared it's going to leave a deep painful mark." Badiha confronted, Bella was taken aback but her resolve was unbroken.</p>
<p>"I am much stronger than I used to be, it's a journey I have been on that you started. I will be fine."</p>
<p>John was not far behind and had the biggest and most wicked smile on his face. Badiha was eating her lunch and so was ignored while John began a routine that was all too familiar.</p>
<p>First he ordered Bella to strip, which she did without hesitation. She still stood with her head held high, a firm power posture usually reserved for the humbling of underlings, only slightly undermined by her total exposure. John led her inside where Badiha was certain he was about to start a fire with her clothes. Badiha simply got to work mowing the lawn and hoping Bella would be OK. After a bit of time Badiha heard John calling her over and hesitantly obliged.</p>
<p>"Badiha, good to see you, we've decided to put together a little montage to send back to mummy, how would you like to be our camerawoman?" He asked, not actually giving Badiha a choice in the matter as he gave her the camera and eagerly awaited the red light that indicated that she was filming.</p>
<p>"Hello Clementine, I am so disappointed in you forgetting your place, but luckily enough something in your DNA must be telling you what a dirty whore you are as daughter dearest has turned up to be degraded. I was going to just give her a quick fuck, stamp my authority on her, but now you've gone and made me mad so I'm going to give her every degrading punishment I planned for you." He sneered, whirring the clippers into life.</p>
<p>Badiha responded to every order of John's, moving the camera to catch Bella's hair falling to the floor or zoom in on her face full of discomfort as he ran the razer across the last remaining vestiges of fluff. Once she was bald John made her stand up and have Badiha follow him with the camera as he inspected her body, giving ample swats to her breasts and bottom before laughing at their jiggling.</p>
<p>"Alright, I guess I better tag my animal then shouldn't I?" John joked at the camera, getting out the piercing gun that had placed the tag in Badiha's ear that had become so familiar. "So this tag labels you as breeding stock, stand still while I apply it."</p>
<p>Bella took a deep breath and stood still, however unlike with Badiha, John did not place it over Bella's ear. Instead he placed it over Bella's left nipple, she let out a squeak as the tag penetrated and attached itself to her body and John continued with the hearty laugh that had punctuated this whole performance.</p>
<p>"Now then, daughter dearest, what happens to breeding stock?" He menacingly asked.</p>
<p>"They get fucked." Bella hesitantly replied.</p>
<p>"Very good, so get on all fours and let's really stamp my mark on you."</p>
<p>Bella obeyed and at John's bidding, Badiha zoomed into Bella's pussy to watch as John's erect cock parted her lips and began to ravage her. Bella stayed silent and resolute the whole time, with Badiha making sure the camera travelled around her body as it was wracked with each thrust from John.</p>
<p>Eventually John called Badiha back over to get a close up as he filled Bella with his cum, she made sure to catch it with the camera as it dripped out of Bella's used pussy.</p>
<p>"Bella will only be released if you send me a video of you watching this footage, start to finish, never looking away. OK?" John ordered to the camera before signaling to Badiha to cut the feed. "This is going to be a great week."</p>
<p>The day after Bella's orientation, John had suddenly rushed off. Then a couple of hours later, Clementine drove up to the house in her big black jeep, several members of a private security team securing the area while Clementine handed clothes over to Bella and Badiha. She barely said a word beyond assuring them that her team would take care of their cars while they rode back with her.</p>
<p>As Badiha got into the car, Clementine began to drive and the silence was palpable.</p>
<p>"Maybe we should turn on the news." Clementine stated, turning on the radio.</p>
<p>"This is Radio Four news bringing you all the latest developments on the dark scandal that is unfolding at the heart of government. Please be aware the details you're about to hear feature sexual violence and which could cause distress in listeners." The polished announcer began.</p>
<p>"John Dobson has been a member of parliament for Blythewood South for over fifteen years, but according to evidence handed over to the associated press he has had a dark secret this entire time. A second family existing only to satisfy his sick desires. We have seen DNA evidence proving that Mr. Dobson had a child with Clementine Maximus, a city attorney witnesses claim he enslaved and tortured at various parties. We have also seen footage of Mr. Dobson sexually abusing Bella Maximus, who he refers to as 'daughter dearest' throughout the video."</p>
<p>Badiha smiled, Clementine had figured out how to use Nym to deliver the worst blow possible to John's reputation.</p>
<p>"We have also received recordings from a series of meetings between John and an anonymous handler who he tasked with ensuring his secret family remained available for his dark desires."</p>
<p>"Sorry to cast you as a bad guy." Clementine spoke up. "But it was smart of you to have that Starbucks barista in your pocket to plant bugs after he'd swept you. It's also the only way I could find out where to come and get you"</p>
<p>"Her name's Akira, she certainly came in handy, her manager was especially pliable with letting her do shifts at other Starbucks when he has complete control of her uniform requirements." Badiha explained.</p>
<p>"I also hope you don't mind but I passed to Aimee some edited highlights of his callousness to her situation in exchange for the access needed to his house to make the frame-up water tight."</p>
<p>"Poor thing." Badiha mumbled before going back to listening to the news.</p>
<p>"The Prime Minister has announced that Mr. Dobson will be stripped of his ministerial post and have the whip removed pending a full investigation. So far nobody has been able to get ahold of him for comment."</p>
<p>"If they want to get ahold of John they better have someone particularly good at jigsaw puzzles." Clementine sinisterly announced.</p>
<p>Badiha looked out over the breathtaking vistas of the Scottish Highlands and reflected on the year since the unpleasantness with John. She had continued to keep her head shaved and instead had taken to wearing various wigs for her different engagements, however the wind whipping around the boat seemed like it would be more than capable of depriving her of the most well secured of wigs so she had opted instead for baldness.</p>
<p>Clementine's redemption was very good news for Badiha. The brutality with which she had eliminated John from her circles firmly cemented her position as someone not to be crossed, so mentions of how far she had fallen were quickly lost to taboo. This also afforded Badiha a degree of invulnerability in her association with Clementine, especially with her trustworthiness concretely proven. This meant that Badiha was able to expand her operation. Although Clementine had convinced her to start charging for her services as favours could only pile up for so long, and now she had more employees to pay.</p>
<p>Her new hires were sat on the boat with her; Nym and Akira, both eager to take on their new roles. Badiha had ordered them both to quit their previous jobs in the most spectacular fashion possible. Akira had turned up to the Starbucks naked and spent her shift writing lewd comments on her body until she was fired. Nym had waited for the next nooner before turning up to repeat her previous adventures, without concealing her identity this time. Now Badiha was taking them for a weekend of orientation.</p>
<p>Grace was also on the boat, she had been working with Malcolm to design a pretty rigourous program for the coming days. Badiha was not involved in the planning as she had decided it was important for new hires to know their boss was more than up to the task of anything they were asked to do, so she would be going through their orientation with them.</p>
<p>They pulled up to the island and as they were about to get off the boat Grace blocked their way.</p>
<p>"All possessions and clothes will be left on the boat, three naked slaves will be coming aboard the island and then everything you own will be taken back to the mainland." Grace explained. Nym and Akira nervously giggled but Badiha didn't hesitate, she had been expecting something like this so had only been wearing a summer dress with no underwear to make stripping down that much easier.</p>
<p>Grace stared at her boss's body, she was always amazed at its continuing evolution. A huge garden of flowers erupted from her hip, added one at a time from every time she took money in exchange for her body. Her E-cup breasts now boasted two metal bars through the nipples with a short length of chain between them, her punishment for sleeping with more men than Grace on a night they were both working. Surgery to give her newer, plumper lips was her own choice, but the tattoo on her inner lip that said 'whore' was based on her being sold for less than Grace at a fetish slave auction they had organised.</p>
<p>Nym and Akira were temporarily shocked by Badiha's brazen display and shameless body, but they weren't far behind on stripping down to join their new boss/fellow slave. They stepped onto the island and Grace was just beginning to explain the ground rules when the whirr of helicopter blades drowned out her voice. A helicopter landed on the only patch of island large enough to safely set down, and out climbed Clementine Maximus.</p>
<p>"Sorry I'm late." She announced. "But I changed my mind, I want to go through orientation after all."</p>
<p>"Alright then, place all your clothes and possessions on the boat and join your fellow slaves." Grace ordered. Much to Badiha's surprise, Clementine stripped down, then placed her wig on top of the pile.</p>
<p>"I wasn't going to let you be the only bald disgrace here." Clementine announced. Badiha had watched her slowly grow back her hair over the past year but clearly the thought of Badiha's Scottish island had made the clippers irresistible.</p>
<p>"Your nipples are still intact, so everyone already knows who's the biggest slut here." Badiha scoffed.</p>
<p>"Is that how you're going to play it then?" Clementine resolved. "How about a wager? I know you're fond of them."</p>
<p>"What have you got in mind?"</p>
<p>"Grace dear, these two slaves are now in a wager, first one to say no loses, we don't leave the island until one of us breaks and says no." Clementine stated.</p>
<p>"OK then. What punishment does the loser get?" Grace asked.</p>
<p>"I hear your friend Nicole is starting up an erotic vacation company for sadistic people of wealth. Loser works there for free for a fortnight." Clementine stated.</p>
<p>"Nice won, I assume the winner will be getting a first class ticket?" Badiha asked.</p>
<p>"Naturally."</p>
<p>"Very well then. Grace, do your worst."</p>
<p>"You're going to regret saying that." Grace sinisterly responded as the four naked slaves lined up for training.</p>
