<p>I crept down the stairs in the near total darkness, just enough light, from the few lights in the air B&amp;B, to let me find Jen's room. She was supposed to sneak up to my room almost half an hour ago, after my best friend and best man had snuck out to keep her sister busy. We'd barely had time to see each other all week, her parents keeping her busy and away from me. Her mom still thought that we weren't having sex, but the reality was, we slept together more nights than not. We had different apartments, and she kept a few things at mine, but not much.</p>
<p>It had been a difficult two years since a rough breakup and then my accidental trip over Jennifer in a store. Since that day the two of us had grown to love each other, more than I could ever put to words, and tomorrow we would share words that would cement that for the rest of our lives. I padded barefoot to the door of her room and reached for the knob. I heard moaning inside, and then a very distinct female gasp. There was no mistaking that type of gasp. I'd heard it almost every time I pushed into Jen's hot, wet pussy. The rhythmic slapping that began as I stood and listened, that I could just make out through the closed door, was also unmistakable.</p>
<p>I pushed the door open quickly and fumbled for the light switch. When the lights came on, we were all temporarily blinded, but me a little less so, since I closed my eyes just as I flipped the switch on. I shaded my eyes and opened them, seeing what I expected and what I hoped I wouldn't see. "JEN! WHAT THE FUCK!?" I shouted, as I stared at my bride to be, laying on the bed nude, my best man on his hands and knees between her legs. Alex's head jerked around and he looked at me through slitted eyes. "Jen!? Fuck no. Julie!"</p>
<p>I stared at him for several seconds and then stepped toward the bed. I reached for Jen's hand and jerked it up and held it between us. "NO! Jen. See the ring mark?" I snapped at him. I jerked her arm harder, rolling her slightly under him. "And her tattoo?" I asked, looking at the small three dots tattooed on her shoulder that her dad had put on her, shortly after she was born, so he could tell his twins apart.</p>
<p>"Shit! I didn't know. I thought it was Julie. She said to meet her here!" He said, pushing himself away from my wife-to-be, his dick glistening with her juices.</p>
<p>I looked down at Jen and shook my head. "How the fuck could you do this? I thought you loved me! That you wanted to marry me! Now I find you cheating on me, with my best friend of all people? How the fuck could you?" I snapped angrily at her, before turning and walking out of the room. Lights all over the house were turning on as I half ran, half stomped up the stairs to my bedroom. I only had on a pair of shorts, but that wasn't going to matter. I found my shoes and pulled them on and began throwing my stuff into my suitcase haphazardly. No way I was staying here another minute.</p>
<p>"Hey man! I didn't know!" Alex said, as he walked into the room. "Julie said to meet her down there, so Jen could come up and be with you."</p>
<p>"Yeah, right!" I snapped. "I really believe that!"</p>
<p>"You should! It's true." Julie said from the doorway. I turned to look at my bride's identical twin, anger still roiling hotly inside me.</p>
<p>"Yeah, and what? Somehow, Jen just accidently ended up with in bed with my best friend?"</p>
<p>"Accidentally? Not even. It was completely planned. She was going to fuck Alex and I was going to come to your room and fuck you. Only thing was, I fell asleep."</p>
<p>"You think I wouldn't figure out it wasn't her?" I snapped.</p>
<p>She held her hand up and wiggled her fingers, showing me that she had on the engagement ring. "You'd have never known."</p>
<p>"Right. You think I don't know my own fiancé?"</p>
<p>She laughed. "You haven't before."</p>
<p>I stopped what I was doing and stared at her. "What the fuck do you mean I haven't before? Before what?"</p>
<p>"You think this is the first time we've swapped partners? Not hardly. We've been swapping boyfriends since high school."</p>
<p>"Julie! NO!" I heard Jen snap from the hallway. Then she was pulled back and Jen stepped into the doorway. I just stood and stared at her, waiting for her to speak. "This was going to be the last time," she whispered.</p>
<p>"The last time? How many times were there?"</p>
<p>"With you? A few."</p>
<p>I stood there and nodded. "A few? HOW MANY?"</p>
<p>"Fifteen," she whispered.</p>
<p>"What the hell? Tell me you're joking. You really did this other times? Why the hell would you do that? Why would you even think about doing that?"</p>
<p>"It's not you. We never meant to hurt anyone."</p>
<p>"Well, you sure as hell did!"</p>
<p>She stepped to me and laid a hand on my arm and I shrugged it off, still staring at her angrily. "We started it as a joke. We'd swap boyfriends on dates and see if they could tell. They never could. After high school we just kept doing it. It was kind of a challenge."</p>
<p>"To what? Humiliate your boyfriends?"</p>
<p>"NO! At first it was to see if they could tell. Then it turned into something else. To see whose boyfriend fucked better. We compared how they were in bed."</p>
<p>"Oh great. Now I'm being compared against your other boyfriends? Well, I hope the hell I stacked up, because there won't be another chance." I said turning back to throwing stuff in my suitcase. "Because I'm gone."</p>
<p>"NO! Stop! PLEASE!" She said, reaching out to grab my arm and pull me to face her again.</p>
<p>"Why, so you can humiliate me some more? Maybe talk me into walking down that aisle so everyone can laugh at the guy that had his fiancé fuck his best friend the night before his wedding? Not happening. I'm done. Have a good life!" I angrily shouted at her, as I tried to close the suitcase.</p>
<p>"KEN! Please! Let me fix this!"</p>
<p>I turned to stare at her. "Fix this? Fix what? Trust? Fix trust? How do you fix trust? How to you erase the horror of seeing your best friend, fucking your soon-to-be wife? Do you have any idea how that feels?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't." She answered quietly. "But I can guess. This was going to be the last time. She wanted to have sex with you one more time."</p>
<p>"And just how many times did we have sex? Since I have no way to tell you apart. I thought the tattoo was good enough, apparently not."</p>
<p>"Sharpie," Julie said from the bedroom door. "Three dots, with a sharpie is all it takes. We used to fool dad that way too."</p>
<p>"Great! You can masquerade for each other. Nice to know. So just how many times did you fake me out?"</p>
<p>"Once for each time she fucked my boyfriend." Julie said with a smug grin. "And not one of them, boyfriend or you, knew it had happened."</p>
<p>"And how many times is that, really? Fifteen is it? Are you sure? How do I know? It could be twenty or fifty for all I know. Not that it really matters at this point."</p>
<p>"Fifteen, well sixteen would have been tonight." Julie said, with a shrug.</p>
<p>"Fifteen!? You pulled this on me fifteen times? WHY!?" I asked, looking past Jen to her sister.</p>
<p>"Because I wanted to know if my boyfriends stacked up to you." Julie said, as she stepped into the room, still wearing the tiny little nightgown that I'd actually given to Jen, some time back. "Besides, you're a damn good fuck. How could I resist?"</p>
<p>"Stacked up to me? In bed? Seriously? You did this...to see if your boyfriend stacked up to me sexually? That is sooooo fucking screwed up! I hope you have fun doing it to the next guy you date."</p>
<p>"You were always the best to me." Jen said quietly. "It wasn't because I was looking, it was because she was looking for someone like you."</p>
<p>"Well, I hate to say it, but neither of you gets me now." I said, as I turned back to the suitcase and zipped it closed.</p>
<p>"You can't leave. It's the middle of the night." Jen said, in a desperate attempt to get me to stay, her hand reaching out and grabbing my arm.</p>
<p>"I don't care. I'm not about to sleep here, let alone stay here one minute longer than I have to. I loved YOU, Jen. I loved you more than anyone else in the world. You betrayed that, not once, but fifteen, no sixteen times. I don't see any way to go back from that." I snapped, as I picked up my suitcase.</p>
<p>"I want to try! I don't want to lose you!"</p>
<p>"Not lose me? Honey, you lost me the moment I walked into that bedroom and saw him between your legs. There is no way BACK from that! There's no undoing it, no changing it, no erasing how it felt in that moment, to see the person you loved; betraying that love and trust in a way that can never be undone." I pulled her hand off my arm and walked out the door, shoving Julie out of the way, when she tried to step in front of me.</p>
<p>"It wasn't her idea! It was mine!" Julie shouted, as I walked down the stairs.</p>
<p>"Doesn't matter anymore." I called back, without even looking back.</p>
<p>It was still early morning, when I pulled into the parking lot of my apartment. It was probably the longest walk of my life, up the stairs to my apartment. The last time I made this walk, this long, was after Suzanne broke up with me. I dropped my suitcase on the floor and walked to my bedroom and flopped onto the bed. Then I did something, that I'd only done one other time, since I was as small child. I cried until I was so exhausted, that I couldn't help but fall asleep.</p>
<p>It was mid-morning on Saturday, my supposed wedding day, before I pulled myself out of bed. I ate some toast, before I dropped onto the sofa in the living room, wishing I'd never met Jennifer. I didn't much feel like doing anything. I turned on the TV to some old western and sat staring at it, not really paying attention to it at all. My life was in the dumpster. Nothing could fix what happened, and nothing could change my life from the dumpster fire it had just become. Today, was supposed to be the beginning of the rest of my life. Now, it felt like I'd been thrown into a pit of hopelessness.</p>
<p>The knock on the sliding glass door startled me. I looked over and standing on my balcony was my neighbor, Marsha. She was a pleasant enough person. Surprisingly athletic for her size, which accounted for how she managed to get onto my second-floor balcony from hers, next door. She had a very sweet disposition, and was often flirty and playful, but only if I was alone. She didn't have a lot of male friends, mostly I suppose, because she wasn't playboy material. She was a bit on the heavier side with plenty of curves, sort of plain, short brown hair. Not anything particularly special. She'd lived next to me for three years now, and had been a good friend through the last breakup, and now this. I'd invited her to the wedding, but she had declined, saying that the last thing Jennifer needed was to have her there on her wedding day. I never understood why, and she wouldn't explain more.</p>
<p>"What are you doing home?" She asked, as I opened the sliding glass door for her. "You're supposed to be getting married right about now, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Was..." I answered sullenly, as she stepped into the kitchen area. I left the door open and walked back to the sofa, flopping down on it where I had been.</p>
<p>"So, wanna share?" She asked, as she walked into the living room.</p>
<p>"Why? Not much to say, I'm here. Obviously not getting married."</p>
<p>"Obviously. Wanna tell me why?" She asked, as she sat down next to me.</p>
<p>"Not really."</p>
<p>"Might help. It's easier than crying again." She said softly. I jerked my head to look at her in surprise. "These walls aren't that thick. I've always been able to hear what's going on in your bedroom."</p>
<p>"Oh. Well, now you know what kind of man I am."</p>
<p>"I do. A very hurt, very sensitive man, that just had something terrible go on in his life." I looked at her, shrugged and looked back at the TV again. "So, what happened?" she pressed.</p>
<p>"I caught her having sex with my best man." I answered quietly. She sat silently, clearly waiting for me to continue. I wasn't sure I wanted to. "Seems that she and her twin sister, have been swapping guys since high school. Last night Jen was supposed to come to my room and Alex was going to go down and have sex with her sister, but they swapped. When Jen didn't show up, I went down to their room and found her with Alex between her legs. He thought he was fucking Julie, but it was really Jen." I said, my voice trailing off to a whisper.</p>
<p>I felt her hand on my shoulder, rubbing gently. "I've heard of twins doing that, but I never thought she was that kind of girl. All the interactions I've had with her seemed pretty straight forward."</p>
<p>"Well, apparently this wasn't the first time. They have some arrangement, that they swap boyfriends, so since I've known her, Jen has actually cheated on me fifteen times. At least that's how many times she'd admit to. Might be more for all I know. But the worst part was, they say this was going to be the last time. If I hadn't walked in on them, I'd have never known. I'd have lived on in our lives, believing a lie. I wasn't supposed to ever know."</p>
<p>"Oh God, I'm so sorry." She whispered. She rubbed my shoulder and then hooked her arm around my shoulders and gently pulled on me. I flopped over on the sofa, ending up laying partly on her lap, her arms wrapped around me as she leaned her head down to softly kiss me on the head. "I know this isn't what you want to hear, but at least you found out now, and not after."</p>
<p>"Part of me wishes I never found out. I would have been fine, not ever knowing." I whispered.</p>
<p>"But would you have? What would happen if it ever came out? You'd have found out you were living with someone so dishonest. Could you keep living with her that way?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Right now, I don't know anything."</p>
<p>"Your phone is ringing." She said softly.</p>
<p>"So? It's probably just Jen again."</p>
<p>"She's already tried to call?"</p>
<p>"About a dozen times. Along with my parents and Alex. I'm not in the mood to talk to anyone."</p>
<p>She pushed me off her lap enough to slip out from under me. She walked to my bedroom and came back with my phone, which was ringing again, the caller ID declaring that it was Jen. "Answer it." She said, "hiding from her isn't going to solve anything."</p>
<p>"I don't want to talk to her."</p>
<p>"So, just listen. She clearly wants to try and patch this up, or she wouldn't be calling over and over."</p>
<p>"I don't know that I want it patched up. I don't know how to ever trust her again."</p>
<p>"I see." She said, as the phone beeped to tell that there was a voice message. She stuck the phone in front of my face to unlock it.</p>
<p>"Honey. Please answer. I don't want to lose you. I do love you. I love you more than I can ever tell you. I want to fix this. I want to find a way to make us work. I have to find a way to make you understand that I do love you. Please answer so we can talk! Please! I'll do anything, and I do mean anything, to show you that you're more important than anyone else in my life. Please my love. Please talk to me."</p>
<p>"Sounds like she's pretty determined to try and make it up to you. Don't you think, she should have a chance?"</p>
<p>"To what? Humiliate me again?"</p>
<p>"No, you heard her. To make it up to you. If you love her, if you really do love her, can't you find it in your heart to at least hear her out?"</p>
<p>"I don't know that there's anything she can do to make it up to me. How do you make up to someone for cheating on them, not once, but fifteen times?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, but you can at least hear her out, right? I mean, before you give up. You know how you were last time. Do you want to go through that again? Do you want to go down that road again?"</p>
<p>"Not really." I admitted.</p>
<p>"Then hear her out."</p>
<p>"You really think there's anything she can say, that will take away the pain she made me feel?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't, but that doesn't mean she doesn't feel pain as well. If she's in love with you, truly in love, then she's feeling it every bit as much as you are right how. Come on. I'll dial her and you can at least hear her out."</p>
<p>"If you think she has anything to say worthwhile, you call her."</p>
<p>"Okay. I will." She answered, as she pressed the call button. "Hi, Jennifer? This is Marsha, Ken's neighbor? Yeah. No. I'm just here because, well, he wasn't supposed to be here today, so I figured something happened... Yeah, he told me what happened... Yes, pretty hard... He isn't really sure he wants to talk to you... See you? I don't know... He doesn't seem to think there's much you can do to change what happened. He's hurt by what you did and doesn't think he can ever trust you again... I understand, but... You really think... Well, I can't make sure he's here without tying him up... Funny... Okay, I'll do what I can... Three hours... Okay. Bye."</p>
<p>"You told her she could come?"</p>
<p>"I did. I think you should at least hear her out. You have a lot invested in this relationship. You want to throw it away without giving her at least one final shot?"</p>
<p>"What difference does it make? She can't fix this."</p>
<p>"She thinks she can try. I think you should at least hear her out. Come on. Get up and go get cleaned up."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"You want to meet her looking like this? I thought you were worried about her humiliating you again. Well, if you see her looking like you do right now, well, you can imagine what she'll think. Come on, let's get you cleaned up and dressed." She said, reaching for my hand and pulling on it.</p>
<p>"I don't want to. You go shower and dress."</p>
<p>"I'm already dressed, but you aren't."</p>
<p>"I don't even want to see her."</p>
<p>"Ken, do you want me to be here with you? You don't have to meet her alone, if you don't want. All you have to do is ask."</p>
<p>I looked at her, "you'd stay here with me?"</p>
<p>"Trust me, I won't leave. If you ask me to stay," she whispered.</p>
<p>"Alright. I'm asking. I don't want to face her alone."</p>
<p>"Then I'll be right here for you. Now come on, let's get you up." She said, pulling on my hand harder again. I let her pull me, and then got up. She walked backwards, pulling me toward the bedroom and then the bathroom. She let go of my hands and started to turn on the shower in the tub. I sat down on the toilet seat as she reached in and adjusted the water temperature, turning around to face me again, once she was satisfied. "Come on, into the shower." When I just sat there, she reached for my hands again and pulled, standing me up. "I'll step outside and you can get undressed. You can't shower if you're still wearing shorts."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Why what?"</p>
<p>"Why bother stepping outside?" I said with a frown, reaching down to push my shorts down. They slid down my legs and I stepped out of them, leaving me completely naked in front of her.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, um, sure, okay then. Well, let's get you into the shower." She said as she looked down at my flaccid dick and reached for the shower curtain. She pulled it back and reached for my hand.</p>
<p>"You're blushing," I said, as I let her pull my hand toward the shower.</p>
<p>"Well, I wasn't expecting this. Not that I mind. But I just wasn't...um, wasn't expecting to see you naked."</p>
<p>"Not like it matters. I'm done with women, I'm done with sex. I'm done with anything to do with relationships!" I said, as I let her coax me into the shower.</p>
<p>"Come on. You don't really mean that."</p>
<p>"Marsha, you know why I broke up with my last girlfriend, the one before Jen?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I do." She whispered. "But just because it didn't work out with her, doesn't mean that you give up on all women."</p>
<p>"You're absolutely right, I mean, so far, I've only been dumped by a woman who decided she'd rather be a lesbian, and fell in love with a serial cheater. I'm sure there's something else I can be humiliated by if we think about it long enough. Clearly, I'm not anything special. Nothing to write home about. Not even good enough to want to keep screwing!" I said as she helped me step into the shower and then pulled the curtain closed for me.</p>
<p>"That's not fair. You're a kind, gentle, considerate man. You're not bad looking and I'm sure you're more than ample in bed."</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>"How would you know that?" I asked, as I stood under the water.</p>
<p>"Trust me Ken, I've heard... I've heard you two in the middle of the night, lots of times. It didn't sound at all like you weren't adequate."</p>
<p>"Which is why she had to cheat on me? Why Crystal turned lesbian? Because I'm so good in bed?"</p>
<p>The curtain pushed back and Marsha stepped into the shower. "Well, since you're done with women and sex, you won't mind if I share your shower then." She said nonchalantly. She wasn't slender but her body looked firm and toned. Her breasts were big, even bigger than Jen's, looking like two huge, cream-colored teardrops hanging on her chest. Her areolae were light brown and easily three inches or more across with a large protruding nipple, pointing slightly upward, toward me. Her stomach was surprisingly firm looking, even though it was somewhat rounded. Her thighs were heavy, but toned and pressed together, partly hiding her pussy, also somewhat hidden by the brown curls on her mound. I didn't have too long to look and she was stepping toward me, pressing her tits to my chest and wrapping her arms around me. She turned me in the shower, putting herself under the water. She tilted her head back and let the water run through her hair, as her pelvis pressed against my suddenly hardening dick, and her tits pressed to my chest as she held us together. "There." She said, stepping toward me, pushing me back with her chest. She turned us again, pushing me under the water again, before she stepped back. "You have some soap?"</p>
<p>"Uh. Sure." I answered, reaching for the bottle of old spice body wash. I handed it to her and she grinned at me.</p>
<p>"Thanks." She said, as she opened the bottle and squirted several long lines of soap across her chest. She handed the bottle back, and then began to rub the soap around her chest. Her hands roamed over and around both big soft tits, lifting and mushing them with her hands, letting her fingers circle her hard nipples and then stroked across her, now rigid, nipples. One hand slid down her body, over her firm stomach, stroking side to side and in circles to spread the soap. Her hand moved lower and lower until it was soaping the matt of curls on her mound. Her hand moved even lower, moving down to her crotch, her fingers curling between her legs as she began to rub her pussy. "You gonna wash, or just stare at me?"</p>
<p>"Uh, yeah..." I grunted, shaking myself from staring at her. I squirted some of the soap onto my hand and set the bottle aside. I started to rub my hands around my chest and down my body, while I watched her stroking herself, clearly teasing her own body. I stared at her hands, cupping both her pussy and her tits as she washed herself, her fingers now clearly more intended to tease herself than wash herself. As I watched her, my hands moved all the way down to my dick and wrapped around it, even without thinking about it.</p>
<p>She stepped a little closer to me and reached out for my wrist with the hand that had been between her legs. She gently coaxed my hand from my dick and then slid her fingers down until her fingers were hooked in mine. She pulled my hand toward her, drawing it closer to her pussy, as she stepped, small shuffling steps, to bring our bodies closer together. "Maybe you'd rather stroke this than yourself?" She whispered softly, pressing the back of my fingers on her curl covered mound. "I mean, since it doesn't much matter anymore, you not being interested in sex or anything. Maybe you just help me wash and I'll help you wash?"</p>
<p>I felt her hand close around my dick and then the other hand moved from her breasts, down to join the first. She let her big soft tits rub side to side on my chest, dragging her nipples back and forth across my chest as her two hands stroked the length of my dick, one sliding all the way up over my engorged mushroom head. Almost automatically I rolled my hand over and slipped my fingers between her thighs, feeling her hot wet pussy lips. She didn't have any protruding inner lip, but her full, round outer lips were definitely shaved down between her legs. I let my middle finger slip between her hot lips. She moaned softly and her hands gripped my shaft a little tighter, as my fingertip stroked over her clit.</p>
<p>"Mmmmmmm. Just keep doing that," she whispered, as I lifted my other hand and cupped one of her big tits. She twisted her body a little, to give my hand more room; allowing me to cup the huge, soft orb and stroke my thumb across her rigid nipple.</p>
<p>I felt her hands push my dick down, aiming it at her pussy as she began to rock her hips, pushing them to and fro, as if trying to stroke herself on my shaft, that was still inches away from her pussy. My finger pressed and stroked over and around her hard clit, as her breathing became more ragged. "Oh fuck, gonna come! Make me come for you." She whispered, as she stroked my dick in time with her hip thrusts, making it almost like we were having sex, without my dick actually being inside her. "OH!" she squeaked, as her body started to tremble. "Oh God, gonna come!" She squeaked, her body starting to bend over slightly as if she were going to double over. I continued to stroke her clit, moving my finger faster and changing my grip on her tit so I could squeeze and twist her nipple. "OH FUCK!" She cried, as her body jerked in front of me. I felt and watched her tremble and shake, as her climax washed over her, her hands on my dick having stopped moving, just holding me as her climax ran its course.</p>
<p>As her body began to soften, the shudders, now occasional trembles, she began to stroke my dick again. She held it, aiming it at her pussy as she stroked me faster, her fingers rubbing under my head across that sensitive spot. I felt the warmth and tingle spread, and despite my best efforts to ignore it, my body responded in the only way it knew how. I jerked hard, my cock shooting gush after gush of cum, out at her, as she let me rest my chest against hers. I felt her stiffen a moment and realized that i was squeezing her nipple harder than I expected, and I let go of it, letting my arm wrap around her and pull her chest tightly to mine. Her hands moved from my cock and I felt them circle around my waist and rest on my ass, pulling us together down there as well. I felt my surging cock slip into the gap of her thighs, her soft skin and her pussy lips pressing against me as my hips automatically tried to stroke in and out of the soft confines. I felt my cock pump at least four more good, hard shots of cum between her thighs, before we were both left, wrapped around each other, panting for breath.</p>
<p>"You know," she whispered. "For someone who wasn't interested in ever having sex again, you managed to come an awful lot."</p>
<p>"Sorry. I didn't mean to...you know."</p>
<p>"I do know. I intended it. I wanted to show you that life and intimacy don't have to end, just because one person betrayed your trust."</p>
<p>"But why? I mean, we've been neighbors for years."</p>
<p>"I know we have," she whispered, "but now isn't the time for that discussion. You need to think about your relationship with Jennifer. You need to think about what it would take to patch that up, to make it work for you."</p>
<p>"Why? Why are you doing this?" I asked, in a whisper.</p>
<p>She was silent for long seconds. "If I have to tell you, then you won't understand." She whispered, as she pushed back from me. "Now, let's get this soap and cum rinsed off, shall we? Can't have your finance showing up and us still being in the shower together, can we?"</p>
<p>"She won't be here for a couple hours." I said, not quite ready to let go of her yet. I didn't understand why, but holding her against me, feeling her soft body against mine was soothing, and right now, soothing was a good thing. "Just let me hold onto you a little while longer."</p>
<p>"Alright," she whispered, pressing herself against me, her arms around me. Her hands idly stroked up and down my back, from my bare butt to my neck, her fingers slowly caressing my back and spine. Her touch was every bit as soothing, as the crush of her tits against my chest, as they moved up and down with our breathing. I felt my dick soften and shrink enough to pull from the tight gap of her thighs, and felt her sigh.</p>
<p>"I think the water's getting cold," she whispered.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it is." I agreed, reaching behind me to turn it off. Reluctantly I let go of her. She pushed the curtain open and reached for the only towel. She handed it to me and stood in the tub next to me, still dripping. I turned to face her and then began to dry her off, wiping her body from her neck down taking time and care to lift each of her big breasts to dry them and under them, before working down further. She stepped one foot up onto the edge of the tub to let me dry between her legs. I squatted down to dry her legs and between them, at the same time, getting a very good look at her pussy. The curls on her mound were actually much more neatly trimmed into a wide triangle, the bottom of which ended at the top of her full round lips. She indeed, did not have any inner labia protruding from between the creamy outer lips. I could also smell the scent of her arousal over the scent of the Old Spice body wash. I reached between her legs with my fingers and gently stroked her lips, drawing some moisture from between them across their soft smooth surface.</p>
<p>"I don't think you want to do that," she whispered huskily.</p>
<p>"Not unless you want something more to happen than just did. I didn't actually intend to have sex with you, just try to show you that you weren't really done having sex yet."</p>
<p>"You telling me you don't want to have sex with me?"</p>
<p>She reached down to my arms and coaxed me to stand up. "Ken, I don't want you to have any illusions here. Would I like to have sex with you? Yes. But right now, you need to focus on Jennifer. If you really love her, having sex with me would only complicate things. It'd only be jilted sex. Not a good thing, and not how I want it to be when I do it with you."</p>
<p>"You really want to have sex with me," I asked quietly?</p>
<p>She shook her head and stepped out of the tub. She began pulling on her t-shirt before she answered. "I think I should go home. I'm just going to complicate things for you."</p>
<p>I stepped out of the tub after her and reached out for her arm. I stopped her before she could pull the shirt over her head. "You promised to stay with me while she's here. You're not going to break your word, are you?" I asked softly, knowing that I was putting her in a no-win situation. Truth was, I didn't want her to leave at that moment. It was comforting to have her here, and right now, I needed that, even if my emotions were all screwed up right now.</p>
<p>"I'll stay, on one condition."</p>
<p>"And that is?"</p>
<p>"That you don't let what you think I might be feeling, affect your decisions. You're in love with Jennifer. I know, I've seen it, and I've heard it. She loves you more than you might realize. She made a mistake. Don't throw everything away, without at least giving her a chance. I can tell you from experience, that if you do, you'll regret it for the rest of your life."</p>
<p>I looked at her for long seconds. From her words I could tell she went through something traumatic and felt like she didn't give, whoever it was, a chance and regrets it now. And she's still single now. Those two could be easily added up. I took a deep breath and nodded. "Alright, I'll do the best I can to give her a chance, but I don't know how she thinks she can fix this."</p>
<p>"I don't either, but you need to hear her out." She whispered. I let go of her arm and she pulled the shirt on. Only then did I realize that she'd not had a bra on when she came over, and I hadn't even realized it. She pulled her shorts on next, now having put on everything she had worn to my house. I suddenly wondered how often she'd come over with almost nothing on, and I hadn't even noticed? She walked out of the bathroom, leaving the door open, as she retreated to the living room.</p>
<p>I dried off and dug out some clean clothes, well, sort of. I pulled on a pair of workout shorts and a t-shirt. Not exactly dressing up, but then, I didn't much think that Jen deserved it, at the moment. By the time I came out of the bedroom, Marsha was in the kitchen making something to eat. I sat at the table and watched her move around, her big tits wiggling under the shirt each time she shifted her weight. How had I never noticed, that she was actually a pretty, nice looking woman? I mean, she wasn't Playboy. She was built stout, but wasn't fat. "Do you jog a lot?" I finally asked, watching her clearly muscular legs moving.</p>
<p>"Some." She replied with a shrug.</p>
<p>"You definitely work out though."</p>
<p>"Sort of." She said, again, avoiding the conversation. "Jen should be here soon. I said I'd stay, but if you two start to patch things up, I'll just slip out, okay?"</p>
<p>"No. Not okay. I don't see any way she's going to patch anything up. No, I want you to stay while she's here."</p>
<p>"And you think that if I leave that she's going to try to seduce you into sex again?"</p>
<p>"Something like that."</p>
<p>"And that'd be a bad thing?"</p>
<p>"It'd be just heaping more humiliation on me."</p>
<p>She paused to look at me and shook her head. "I don't see how a woman that is in love with you, making love to you, is adding humiliation."</p>
<p>"Her sister slept with me over a dozen times, and I couldn't even tell! That's humiliating."</p>
<p>"Really? You couldn't tell identical twins apart, and that's humiliating? I'd be willing to bet, that if you were blindfolded, you couldn't tell Jen's kiss from any other woman."</p>
<p>"Sure, I could!"</p>
<p>"Um. Over a dozen times the answer was no, since you were kissing her sister, in the dark. So, you still wanna go with that?"</p>
<p>"Good point. Okay, maybe I couldn't tell. But I would have thought I could tell how they have sex."</p>
<p>"Not if they're intentionally trying to make it the same."</p>
<p>"Okay." I finally agreed.</p>
<p>"Good. Now, I need to go dress in something more appropriate. I don't think you want me meeting your potential wife in something like this."</p>
<p>"Why not? You embarrassed about your tits?"</p>
<p>"No. Trust me, it's a woman thing. I'll be back in a few minutes." She said as she headed to the balcony. I watched her climb on the railing and then slip around the dividing wall that separated her balcony from mine. I suddenly wondered how many times she'd slipped around that way, when I didn't know it.</p>
<p>True to her word, she was back in less than ten minutes, wearing an attractive, navy blue skirt, a cream colored blouse with buttons about half way down the front, and very obviously, a bra. Now all we had to do was wait.</p>
<p>The time estimate seemed to be a little off. It took her almost, three and a half hours, to get here, not arriving until almost three in the afternoon. When she knocked on the door Marsha walked to the door and answered it. The two talked in low tones for a few moments and then Jen walked in, followed by another of the bridesmaids, Clara.</p>
<p>Clara was Jens' best friend, aside from her sister of course. She was a tall willowy blond with a modest size chest, long muscular legs and long blonde hair, fashioned back in a loose braid that extended most of the way to her butt. She had on a very short black, hip hugger style mini skirt and a snug spandex top that left her belly bare and her belly button ring exposed. She looked quite sexy, as compared to Jen, who was, uncharacteristically, wearing a pair of loose-fitting jeans and an equally unflattering t-shirt. At least she wasn't trying to push me to have sex with her again.</p>
<p>Jen walked into the room and stood in front of me, her hands in front of her, clasped so tightly together that I could see the blood draining from her fingers. She looked at the floor for long seconds before she looked up to me. "I know there isn't anything that I can ever say, that would make up for what I did. It was a stupid, childish thing, that I've been letting my sister con me into, over and over again, over the years. It was never meant to hurt you. The first time we did it, it was just swapping boyfriends, like we always did. Usually, we only did it once for a guy, but, well, um, Julie finally admitted that she was getting me to do it with her other boyfriends, just so she'd have a chance to have you again. I guess you sorta knocked her socks off that first time and she wanted more. I'm sorry, I messed up more than I can ever express."</p>
<p>"Yeah, you did. You have no idea how it felt, to walk into that room and realize that it was you and not Julie."</p>
<p>"How did you know? Never mind. It doesn't matter. You did. And it hurt you more than I can ever make up for. But I want to find a way. I don't want to lose you. You're way too important to me, to let it happen without trying to stop it."</p>
<p>"And just how are you going to put that genie back in the bottle?"</p>
<p>"I don't think I ever can. But if you let me, I can try to at least lasso the genie, as you put it."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"You said that I didn't know how you felt, you're right. I never actually watched any of my boyfriends having sex with my sister. We usually tried to do it at the same time, so there wasn't any chance of crossing things up. Well, I can at least try and see what you felt, by watching you have sex with my best friend."</p>
<p>I looked at her like she had three heads. "Wait a second. You want me to have sex with your best friend, and somehow that's going to fix this?"</p>
<p>"No, I have no illusion that it'll fix things. But it will at least let me feel something, like what you had to be feeling. Maybe then you'll at least be willing to talk about ways to fix things. I talked to Clara and she agreed to do this. You can have sex with her as many times today and tonight as you want, and I'm not going to do anything else but watch."</p>
<p>I sat there staring at her. I didn't know what to think. She must have taken my silence as a dismissal of the idea. She stepped to me, dropped to her knees and took my hands in hers. "Please Ken. Please, try this. Think of it as revenge sex if you have to. She's going to do her best to rock your world, and I'm going to sit and watch her do it. I know it won't be the same as walking in on you, but it's the best I can do."</p>
<p>"So, once you feel as hurt as I do, how does that fix us?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't, but it at least gives us a level playing field to talk. That'll help, won't it?"</p>
<p>"Sure, along with me fucking fifteen of your friends maybe." I joked.</p>
<p>She looked at me for a moment. "Okay, that's fair. I bet I can talk fifteen of my friends into having sex with you."</p>
<p>"Wait, what? I was just joking!"</p>
<p>"I'm not. You have sex with fifteen of my friends. I had sex with fifteen other guys that you never even knew about. I give you fifteen of my friends for one fuck session each. Then we're even."</p>
<p>"I don't think it works that way."</p>
<p>"Can't it? I mean, that's what you're upset about, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"No. What I'm upset about is that the pussy that was supposed to be mine, for all time, got used by fifteen other guys first."</p>
<p>"Honey. I'd had sex with a number of guys before you came along. And I know you had sex with a number of women before I came along. Why does it matter that those fifteen were after we met?"</p>
<p>"Because once we were going together seriously, there was an expectation of celibacy, aside from each other," I answered.</p>
<p>"And I broke it, I can't unbreak that. I want to, I'd give anything to, but I can't."</p>
<p>"So, your answer is to have your best friend cheat, to fuck me, and how many of your other friends are married and you'd ask them to cheat? I can't even imagine asking my friends to cheat on their wives."</p>
<p>"She's not asking me to cheat." Clara said quickly. "Am I married? Yep. I am. And my husband knows exactly what I'm here to do and why. He's good with it."</p>
<p>I snorted softly. "Right. He just rolled over and said, sure honey, go fuck this other guy. Have fun! Right!"</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"Actually, it isn't far from that. He told me he's good with it, because he's getting something from it, that I've refused to give him before."</p>
<p>"Yeah? What's that?"</p>
<p>"A night with three women at once."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I do this, he gets to have Julie and the other two bridesmaids all night. They get the bridal suite and anything they want to do until checkout time tomorrow."</p>
<p>"WHY would you do something like that?"</p>
<p>"Because I love Jen. In some ways, I owe her my life. That's why we're best friends. He understands what Jen means to me and I understand what the cost is. We're adults and it's our choice. The only question is, are you willing to try to let Jen feel, at least some of what you felt, or maybe, still are feeling?"</p>
<p>"I don't know that this fixes a hell of a lot. I mean, there's a hell of a lot of betrayal that I'm feeling. It isn't just the sex, it's realizing that she did what she did, she CHOSE to do that."</p>
<p>"And now she's choosing to sit, and watch me try to rock your world. I'm supposed to give you the biggest, hardest orgasms I can, and encourage you to do the same to me. I can't make you feel like this is your idea, but I can sure as hell make you want to keep doing it all night."</p>
<p>"It's still not the same thing." I said, shaking my head. "It's her idea for you to do this. It wasn't my idea to have her do my best friend or my idea to have my best friend fuck her. It's NOT the same thing."</p>
<p>"So, you're saying that it has to be something that isn't my idea?" Jen asked as she remained kneeling in front of me.</p>
<p>"It has to be something you'd never want to walk in on. Then, maybe, just maybe, you'll feel a little of what I felt."</p>
<p>I could see the gears turning in her head, so to speak. I'll give her credit for at least trying to find a way to make things up, though I had no idea what could possibly do that. "Like a former girlfriend?" She finally asked, looking intently at me.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Something like that." I agreed. "You walking in on me having sex with a former girlfriend would be equivalent. Someone that could still have an emotional attachment and would be a threat to you, to us as a couple."</p>
<p>She looked down at my hands and I could see her almost melt. "I don't know how to do that. How to make that happen." She whispered.</p>
<p>"Does it have to be a former girlfriend?" Clara asked suddenly. Jen looked back at her questioningly. "What about a different potential advisory for his love? Someone else who cares about him, maybe even loves him?"</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose," Jen answered. "But who?"</p>
<p>Clara stepped back and turned to face Marsha, sitting in one of the other chairs in the living room. "I think we actually have that person, I don't see any reason that a woman would, intentionally, sit through something like this unless she cared about Ken."</p>
<p>"No, no, no! Leave me out of this. I'm just his neighbor," Marsha protested.</p>
<p>"Actually, given your body language, and the intensity of your protest, I'd say that you care very much about Ken. Maybe even love him, but haven't told him because you didn't want to mess up his relationship. Am I getting close?" Clara asked.</p>
<p>"Of course not!" she protested again. "I'm just here for moral support."</p>
<p>Clara turned back to look at Jen. "Tell me, how would you feel if you walked in and saw him having sex with her?"</p>
<p>Jen looked at Marsha and then at me. She looked in my eyes for a long time and then looked back at Clara. "I'd be devastated." She whispered.</p>
<p>"Even more than if you walked in on the two of us having sex?"</p>
<p>"Well, yeah. I mean, you'd never do that unless I told you to."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't, and you know that. If you really want to feel that betrayal, I think that's what we do."</p>
<p>"What?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Your neighbor has sex with you. Maybe even the two of us."</p>
<p>"Marsha?" I asked looking past Jen, at Marsha, her face beet red as she blushed. "Is she right? Do you have feelings for me?"</p>
<p>Marsha shrugged coyly and looked down at her hands. "I won't say the idea hasn't appealed to me. After what you went through with...I won't even say her name...After the way you were hurt by her. I kind of got used to being close to you, helping you out."</p>
<p>"And today, in the shower?" I asked. "There was more to it than trying to convince me that I wasn't ready to give up on sex or women."</p>
<p>"Sorta," she whispered.</p>
<p>"In the shower?" Jen asked, looking at me again.</p>
<p>"She forced me to take a shower and clean up before you came, and she got in the shower, naked, with me. We sorta..."</p>
<p>"Had sex?"</p>
<p>"No. We just touched each other. She wanted to convince me that I wasn't ready to give up sex or women."</p>
<p>"Touched each other, as in... played with each other until you came?"</p>
<p>"Yeah." I said with a shrug. "It was a convincing way to make her point."</p>
<p>Jen shook her head and a little smile crept to her lips. "You are such a boy scout. That's actually one of the things I love so much about you. Honey, she wanted to convince you that you weren't ready to give up sex or women, because she was hoping that there was a chance, she might be that next woman. But she didn't want to go all the way, sex wise, as long as there was a chance you'd get back with me."</p>
<p>I looked at Marsha, who wasn't looking at anything but the floor. "Is that true?"</p>
<p>"Sorta." Marsha whispered.</p>
<p>"So, if she asked you to, would you have sex with him and let her watch?" Clara asked her directly.</p>
<p>Marsha looked up at her face, a panicked look spreading across it. "I should leave." She said, standing up.</p>
<p>Clara stepped in front of her to block her way to the door. "Actually, I think you should stay. More than stay, I think you should let me make out with you for a while and then invite Ken to join us and let him do what you've been wishing for, let him fuck you until you come."</p>
<p>"I don't think I could do that." She whispered, but didn't try to move past Clara.</p>
<p>"Couldn't do what? Let him have sex with you? It's what you want, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"I don't think I could make out with another woman," she whispered.</p>
<p>"Are you willing to try? For Ken's sake?" Marsha looked over at me. I could see conflicted emotions in her face, but she finally nodded, without taking her eyes off me. "Alright. I guess we have a plan. I hope you're ready for the hottest night of your life, because I plan on making sure that Ken rocks your world as many times as I can coax him to."</p>
<p>"What about you?" Marsha asked.</p>
<p>"I'll get some from him and some from you. It makes my deal with my husband all the easier. I wasn't looking forward to having to tell Ken he wasn't going to be able to come inside me, but now, well, he can come in you as many times as he wants. The more the better."</p>
<p>Jen looked back at me, her face, clearly panicked. It was almost as if she were begging me to say no. Her lips parted and she whispered, almost silently, "please." I couldn't tell if it was, please do this, or please don't. Clara was right. This could very well make Jen feel what I felt, or at least something close to it. When no one answered, Clara took that as agreement and stepped closer to Marsha. She reached for the top button on Marsha's blouse and then began to undo the buttons. There weren't a lot, only half a dozen, but it allowed the top to spread more than enough to easily fit her head through. Clara reached to her waist and undid the little zipper on the side of the skirt and pushed it down, the navy-blue material sliding down her legs. Clara moved her hands to Marsha's shirt tail and pulled it up, dragging the thin blouse up her body and over her head. She tossed it onto the chair and then reached for Marsha again, stepping closer to reach around her. She unclipped her bra and then gently slipped it off her shoulders, and from between them, leaving her in nothing, but a small white bikini panty.</p>
<p>"Mmmmmm. These look scrumptious," Clara whispered, as she turned Marsha to face Jen and me. She leaned her body over and cupped one of Marsha's tits, sticking her tongue out and flicking it over the fat, rigid nipple. Marsha gasped slightly, as she stood there, letting Clara tease and lick her areola and nipple. It was easy to see that Marsha was getting more than a little turned on, one of her hands gently stroking over her panty covered mound, almost as if she wanted to reach between her legs, but at the same time, was afraid to. In the end, she didn't have to. Clara slipped one hand down to her crotch and began to gently stroke her fingers over and across the small amount of panty covered pussy that wasn't protected by her thighs. In response Marsha's hand went to Clara's head and began to stroke it as she moaned softly in pleasure.</p>
<p>"Your turn," Clara said, after a few more moments, letting go of Marsha and standing upright. She looked over at Jen. "You might as well sit down and get comfortable. This is going to take a very enjoyable while!"</p>
<p>Marsha hesitantly pushed Clara's top up, the spandex rolling up her body to expose more and more of her firm creamy abs and then her breasts. Once free of the restraint of the spandex, her two, now free breasts, formed two grapefruit sized orbs, each sagging slightly down on her chest. Each breast had an oblong shaped, dark pink areola, with a small hard nipple jutting out from the center. Marsha reached for the elastic waist of the hip hugger skirt that Clara had on, and pushed it down over her hips and butt, revealing that she had nothing at all on under it. Her completely shaved mound and pussy lips were exposed in moments as her skirt slid down her long legs. She stepped out of her shoes and the skirt, and then stood in front of Marsha completely nude.</p>
<p>"Go ahead. You can touch, or lick anything you want," Clara whispered.</p>
<p>Marsha looked at her face and then down at her breasts. She reached out and cupped both her soft tits and lifted them slightly while she bent over to bring her face to the level of her breasts. She tentatively reached her tongue out and stroked it over Clara's hard nipple, drawing a pleasurable moan from her lips. "You like that?"</p>
<p>"I do. Tease around it too. Don't be afraid to suck on it either."</p>
<p>Marsha teased her tongue over and around one nipple for long seconds before she opened her mouth and pressed her lips to her breast, engulfing her entire areola. I watched Clara's face as she enjoyed the attentions Marsha was giving her sensitive nipple. She closed her eyes and let her head fall backwards, one hand moving to the back of Marsha's head and the other to one of Marsha's huge tits as it hung down between them. Clara's grip on her breast, seemed to be the trigger she needed to switch breasts, letting go of one with soft slurp before she moved her face to the other.</p>
<p>I felt a hand in my lap and glanced down, finding Jen's fingers gently stroking my growing hardon through the material of my shorts. I tried to ignore it as I looked back at Marsha and Clara. I watched one of Marsha's hands leave Clara's boobs and slip down to her crotch. Clara let out a long low moan as Marsha's fingers slipped between her legs and gently stroked her pussy. They stood like that for several minutes, Marsha sucking and stroking Clara's tits and pussy, while Clara squeezed and massaged Marsha's big tits and nipples. Finally, Clara moved her hands and coaxed Marsha to let her oral grip release, lifting her until she could press their bodies together. She lowered her face to Marsha's, who stood several inches shorter. I watched the two kiss, tentatively, at first, but then with growing passion as they licked and sucked each other's lips. Their hands roamed over each other's bodies as they kissed and Clara finally pushed Marsha's panties down, at least as far as she could reach, which wasn't all that far.</p>
<p>They broke the kiss and Clara began to slowly squat down, kissing her way down Marsha's body while her hands pushed the panties lower and lower. She paused her downward travel to kiss and lick and suck each nipple for several seconds before working her kisses lower again. She worked the panties down Marsha's legs until they'd reached the floor. She coaxed Marsha to step from them and then used her hand to make sure that when she put her foot down again, it was spread well apart of the other. She leaned her face between Marsha's legs, reaching for her pussy with her tongue.</p>
<p>"Oh fuck," Marsha moaned, as Clara apparently connected with where she was headed. I couldn't see it, but I knew what her pussy looked like from earlier, and I could easily imagine what Clara's face looked like, licking that full, round pussy. My dick also could imagine it and was now rock hard in my shorts. I felt Jen move her hand and in moments I felt it slip into the elastic waist band. Her fingers grasped my hardon and began to slowly stroke me inside my pants. I was way too turned on, to stop her at that point and my mind started to think about pulling her onto my lap to fuck her. It never got past the thinking stage, before Clara abruptly pulled her face from Marsha's crotch. Clara stood up, leaned against Marsha to whisper something. Marsha looked over at me and then back to Clara before nodding. The two turned and stepped the dozen or so steps to where I was seated.</p>
<p>Marsha knelt down in front of me and rested her hands on my knees. She slowly stroked her hands up my legs and then my body, finding the waist band of my shorts. "Time to get rid of these." She said softly, as Clara moved around to the other side of Marsha, standing now in front of Jen. Marsha pulled on my shorts, and I lifted myself enough off the sofa to let her pull them and my briefs down, Jen pulling her hand away from my dick now that it was exposed.</p>
<p>"I guess I should move." Jen said quietly, starting to try and get up.</p>
<p>"No, you should just stay where you are," Clara said softly. "You're not going to like me for what I'm going to do, but it's what you made me promise to do."</p>
<p>Marsha pulled my shorts and briefs off my feet and tossed them aside. She lifted herself and climbed onto the sofa, straddling my lap, facing me. She rested her very wet pussy against my raging hardon for long seconds, as she settled herself on my lap. She worked my shirt up and off my body, my arms lifting to let her take it off. With me as naked as she was, she lowered her face to mine and pressed her lips to mine.</p>
<p>We sat there, my hands roaming up and down her back, as we kissed. Unlike her kiss with Clara, there was no hesitancy at all in her actions. Her kiss was soft and erotic and loving. She teased my lips and sucked them and my tongue, as she let the fingers of one hand stroke up and down my chest. She gently broke the kiss and moved her hand to cup one of her big tits. "This is what you wanted to kiss earlier, wasn't it?" She whispered, as she lifted her nipple to my lips. "Go ahead. Make me feel, what you think of my body."</p>
<p>I opened my mouth and sucked her nipple in. I teased my tongue over and around her nipple, teasing her areola with the tip of my tongue. I slid my hands up her body and cupped both her tits, replacing her hand with mine. I felt her lift herself off my shaft and then felt her a hand grasp it. The hand stroked me slowly, moving over my dick and head with each long slow stroke. I felt my dick be pushed back until I could feel Marsha's hot wet pussy lips rub against it. Back and forth it moved, drawing moisture from her wet depths to lubricate my head. The movement stopped and Marsha began to lower herself down, slowly forcing my dick into her. Her pussy enveloped me slowly, expanding to accept my fat, six-and-a-half-inch length, her velvety soft, wet depths teasing my head, as she slowly lowered herself down me. I felt her bare ass touch my thighs, just as my engorged head pressed against the end of her vaginal tunnel.</p>
<p>"God, I've wanted to feel this for so long..." she whispered huskily, as she began to slowly lift herself. She raised up off my lap until my head was almost ready to slip from her, and then she started down again, forcing me back into her. I let her turgid nipple slip from my mouth, and looked up at her face. She was looking down at me, her face filled with lust and desire, and along with that, something else. The same thing I was used to seeing in Jen's face, as we made love. Her bare cheeks bumped against my thighs and she started up again, this time faster. Each stroke seemed to be slightly faster, until she was bouncing on my lap, driving me hard into her and into the end of her vagina. She gasped and moaned as I held her tits, rubbing my thumbs across her nipples, as the sexy, melon sized mounds of pleasure, bounced in my hands. Up and down, she went, moaning and whispering how wonderful it felt, how much she loved how it felt. Her almost constant stream of soft whispers to me, began to change as she pushed both of us closer to climax. "Oh God sweetie. Yes, come for me. Let me feel you come deep in my pussy. I've waited for this for so, so, long. I wanted you to do this in the shower today. I knew I shouldn't, but I wanted you to and I could barely keep myself from begging you to. God Ken, I've loved you from afar for so long. Watched you hurt and comforted you, all the while I wanted to be in your arms, feeling you making love to me."</p>
<p>"Oh damn." I groaned, as my climax inched ever closer. I'd never known how she felt, how much I clearly meant to her. I suddenly began to consider how much she meant to me, how often I had relied on her comfort and support, how many times we'd sat next to each other, yet I never knew how much she wanted me to do this.</p>
<p>"Oh God honey, I'm going to come, come for me. Come with me. Let me feel your desire fill me!" she gasped loudly. "Ohhhhhh God, yes. Gonna come! Come for me! Please come for me!" She cried in a squeaky voice, as she tried to hold off her climax, her arms and legs already beginning to shudder slightly.</p>
<p>Each trip down my shaft smashed my engorged head into her depths, sending little tingles racing down my cock to my balls. Each stroke pushed me closer and closer. I could feel her pussy begin to clench around me, little spasms at first, but then harder as her legs trembled more. She refused to stop moving, driving herself up and down my cock in an attempt to get me to come with her climax. Her motions grew a little erratic and her leg trembles were turning into whole body shudders. "Uh, fuck." I grunted, as my body suddenly jerked hard, trying to drive up into her already descending body. I felt my cock drive hard into the end of her depths moments before my body began to surge cum into her. My body jerked and spasmed time after time, each one forcing more cum deep in her pussy.</p>
<p>She sat on me, her body trembling and shuddering as she climaxed with me, panting and gasping for air. It seemed like half an hour, but I was sure it was only a long minute or two before my cock started to soften inside her. She stayed sitting on me, staring down at me, a look of concern slowly etching on her face. "I'm sorry." She whispered.</p>
<p>"For what?"</p>
<p>"For saying all those things."</p>
<p>"Did you mean them?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But you weren't ever supposed to know. You had a love and it wasn't me."</p>
<p>"If they were true, don't apologize. I'd much rather know the truth, than have you hide it from me."</p>
<p>"I feel like I just messed up our friendship," she said, the look of concern still on her features.</p>
<p>I squeezed her tits and smiled at her. "No, you didn't. But now I know why you put up with so much and still kept coming over."</p>
<p>"I hate to spoil this touching moment, but I need for you to climb off."</p>
<p>"You do. Remember what we're trying to do here?"</p>
<p>"Oh yeah." Marsha whispered, she lifted up on her knees and then stepped back to stand straddling my knees.</p>
<p>"Okay Jen. You're not going to like this, but I need you to lick him. I don't want you to stop, until you've cleaned off all their cum, and have him hard again."</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Jen looked at her friend and looked like she was going to object. Instead, she nodded slowly, then moved to lay on the sofa, so she could put her face in my lap. She grasped my dick with her fingers and engulfed me with her mouth. I felt her tongue licking my shaft, as she cleaned both mine, and Marsha's cum off of me. She spent long minutes, stroking my dick with her lips and tongue before, with Clara's prodding, she began to lick and suck our combined cum off my balls and around the base of my shaft. It took almost ten minutes before my dick was standing tall and rigid again. Clara pushed Jen up and back so her head was resting on my chest, her cheek pressed to my chest.</p>
<p>Clara gently moved Marsha, to sit on the sofa next to me, and then she climbed onto my lap the way Marsha had been. "Okay Jen. Put it in me."</p>
<p>Jen reached for my dick, and I realized from her touch, that it was her hand that had rubbed my dick between Marsha's lips and held me in place, while she slid down onto me. Now Clara was doing the same, sliding slowly down my saliva coated dick. She moved down slowly, her pussy not quite as tight as Marsha had been, but pleasant all the same. She settled herself on me a bit more, then began moving up and down, stroking herself up and down my shaft. "You need to let me know before you come. I'm not allowed to let you come in me, but I have a hunch that Marsha will be more than happy to finish for me."</p>
<p>"I know I will." Marsha said softly, leaning over to gently kiss my cheek, her big soft tits pressing against my arm.</p>
<p>Clara silently stroked up and down my shaft, working her hips to roll as well as stroke, her efforts clearly designed to push my orgasm up quickly. I was amazed at how fast she got me close to coming again, and then, in a complete surprise, she changed her motions to do just the opposite. She sat on me, moving up and down very slowly, teasingly, but not nearly enough to push me over the top. She lifted and lowered for several minutes, keeping me hard, but letting my impending orgasm slowly pull back, leaving me slightly frustrated. "Don't worry." She whispered, as she picked up her pace again, driving hard down onto me, so her ass slapped loudly against my thighs.</p>
<p>Up and down, she drove, slamming herself hard onto me. I could feel her pussy clenching and spasming as she continued stroking, her body clearly climaxing, as she drove her panting, gasping body down onto me over and over.</p>
<p>"Getting close." I grunted. She immediately slowed down again, slowing her strokes to just hold me ever so close but not over the edge. Slowly my body retreated from the impending release, leaving me feeling frustrated again. I had my hands on her hips, and tried to lift and lower her on me, trying at the same time to lift and lower my own hips to drive into her. She let her weight down on me and sat on my thighs, letting me do neither.</p>
<p>"Patience," she whispered. "All in due time. You want a nice big load to give Marsha, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Sure," I panted. "But I also want to come."</p>
<p>"I'm going to get you close again, and then we'll switch partners."</p>
<p>"Okay," I breathed, as she began to lift and lower again. "Ohhh damn, that feels good."</p>
<p>"You feel so fucking fat in me. God damn! You feel like a fucking log in my pussy!" she panted, as she bounced with abandon. "Ohhhh shit. I'm going to come again. Jesus. It's been years, since I came twice on one cock."</p>
<p>"Well, you're gonna get it if you aren't careful." I grunted, feeling my own orgasm racing toward completion.</p>
<p>"Can you wait another minute?" She gasped.</p>
<p>"I can try."</p>
<p>"Oh God. Yes. Here it comes honey. God I'm commmmmiiiiinnnnggg!" she screamed, as her whole body began to shudder and jerk. She slammed herself down on me, and sat on me, so I couldn't push into her, her whole body enjoying the climax. "Okay," she panted, after a few minutes, that had allowed my climax to once again recede.</p>
<p>She pulled off my dick and then took my hands. "Come on. Stand up. Jen, lay down."</p>
<p>Jennifer lay down on the sofa on her back, seeming to know what her friend was expecting. Clara reached for one of Marsha's hands and then gently pulled her to crawl over Jen, leaving her pussy over Jen's face. "Okay. Now you can have that orgasm. Give her the whole load honey."</p>
<p>"Over Jen?"</p>
<p>"Yep. Trust me."</p>
<p>I crawled over Jen's head and felt her hand gasp my shaft. I looked down at her, seeing her looking up at me. She bit her lower lip, waiting for me to move, clearly not wanting to encourage me to do what we both knew I was going to do. Finally, my desire to climax overcame my sudden desire to not hurt her feelings any further, and I crawled forward a little more. She rubbed my head up and down Marsha's bare lips, working my head between her full lips. I pushed forward and watched my cock disappear inside Marsha. I pushed in slowly, feeling Marsha's body expand again to accept me. I started to stroke in and out of her, watching my cock disappear with each thrust. I moved my hands from her hips to her tits, capturing her swinging tits and gripping them. I squeezed her nipples and allowed the weight of her swinging breasts, to try and pull her nipples from my hands, making her gasp and moan in pleasure.</p>
<p>In and out I thrust, feeling my body get closer and closer to climax.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about making her come. I promise, she will." Clara whispered to me, as she rubbed her hand up and down my back, stroking me from my neck to my butt.</p>
<p>"You want me to..."</p>
<p>"I want you to fill her pussy. I want you to give her every ounce, of your cum, deep in her cunt." Clara whispered. "Let it happen. Let that load you were building up for me, flow into her instead."</p>
<p>"Oh damn." I groaned, as she reached down between Marsha and me, and grasped my balls. She squeezed and kneaded them gently, as I thrust into Marsha over and over, my climax suddenly racing to completion. She knelt on the sofa next to me, one hand on my balls and the other stroking my ass. I felt her fingers slide down further, and then in another huge surprise, I felt her finger push right into my ass hole as I stroked back. The shock made me thrust hard forward and triggered my pent-up climax. I held Marsha's tits as my body bucked and tried to thrust harder into her, Clara pushing what felt like a massive rod in and out of my ass, but was actually only the tip of her finger. She held herself against my shuddering body as she stroked her finger in and out of me, making me pump shot after shot into Marsha, and then, after my cock was drained dry, still tried to pump more.</p>
<p>"That a boy." She whispered, "I told you I could rock your world. I bet you've never come like that before."</p>
<p>"I don't think so." I panted, as her hand rubbed my butt but no longer pushed into me. I felt my cock start to soften inside Marsha.</p>
<p>"Now, pull out, but don't go anywhere." She whispered. I pulled back and Clara slipped off the sofa so I could spread my knees further. She guided my dick to Jen's face. "I think you know what to do with this."</p>
<p>"Uh huh." She answered, opening her mouth and engulfing my, now mostly soft, dick.</p>
<p>"Don't go anywhere," she said, as Marsha started to move away from us.</p>
<p>"Oh no. I have one more important task for you."</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"To climax for me."</p>
<p>"But Ken just came. He isn't going to..." Marsha started to protest.</p>
<p>"Never said it would be him." Clara said with a grin. "Jen is going to make you come, and she's going to take everything you can give her, including all of Ken's cum."</p>
<p>"That's disgusting!" Marsha protested.</p>
<p>"Maybe, but this isn't about you, it's about Jen. Just let us do this."</p>
<p>"Oh, fine." Marsha said, with a sigh. She let Clara push her butt down until her pussy was only an inch or two from Jen's face, who was looking at her best friend pleadingly.</p>
<p>"No. You made me promise to not stop until I was sure you understood what he felt. This may not be what either of us expected, but I'm just using what's available. If you love him, make Marsha come, and I don't mean some little, puny climax. Make her come like you used to make me come."</p>
<p>Jen sighed and turned her face back to Marsha's pussy. She reached her hands up and pulled her down until her lips were pressed to Marsha's full lips. Clara coaxed me to shift, until I was sitting on the sofa with my legs spread around Jen's head and shoulders, allowing me to watch Jen licking Marsha's pussy. I'd seen plenty of porn of women licking each other, and men licking women, but somehow seeing it in person, was incredibly stimulating. Now knowing that she had done this to her best friend, it was somehow even hotter. I sat and watched, seeing Marsha begin to respond, Jen's tongue driving deep between her lips to coax the climax I had started building, to grow.</p>
<p>Slowly, lick by lick, Marsha's moans grew and her hips moved, trying to grind her clit into Jen's chin, but Jen wasn't having any of it. She used her arms to hold her in place, allowing her to continue assaulting her clit.</p>
<p>"Ohhhh damn. Ohhhh God! Shit! You're going to make me come. OHHHHHHHH FUCK YES!" She squealed, as her whole body started to shake. I saw her body tremble and then jerk, hard. Her whole body began to buck and shake, gushes of her juices, flowing out over Jen's face, until her head was lying in a puddle, on the sofa cushion. She pushed Marsha's pussy up from her face, until she could roll her off enough to get out from under her. Jen rolled off the sofa and walked to the sliding glass door to the balcony. She pushed the door open and stepped outside. I saw her sit in one of the chairs on the balcony and hang her head. There was no mistaking what she was doing.</p>
<p>I got up from the sofa, torn between what to do. Part of me was glad she was crying, part of me hurt, because she was hurting. I looked down at Marsha, laying on the sofa, panting, dealing with the fading effects of the hardest orgasm she'd probably ever had. She looked up at me, wanting to say something, but not doing it. Her mouth opened and closed a couple times before she whispered, "go to her." I stood and looked at Jen sitting out on the balcony sobbing. "Go to her," Marsha said louder. "She loves you and you love her. Go to her! Forgive her! Don't let it happen again." I looked down at her questioningly. "Go, please, before I ask you not to."</p>
<p>I turned away from her and walked to the door. I stood in it, not stepping though, but listening to her sitting, crying. I stepped through and stepped behind her, resting my hands on her shoulders, her t-shirt soaked with Marsha's cum.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry," She managed to get out, between sobs. "I had no idea how much it...I could hurt you."</p>
<p>"But you do now?"</p>
<p>"I do now." I whispered back. She turned in the chair, then stood up. She stepped to me, wrapped her arms around me and pulled us together. I let my arms slip around her and hold her as she rested her head on my shoulder. "I'm so sorry. How can you ever forgive me for hurting you so?"</p>
<p>"I don't know." I answered. "But I'm willing to try."</p>
<p>She lifted her head from my shoulder and turned her head. She turned my face with her fingers, urging me, but not forcing me, to look at her. She leaned her face to mine and gently pressed her lips to mine. She kissed me gently, softly, her lips barely touching mine. She wasn't trying to be erotic or sexy, but she wanted to express her emotions in a physical way. We stood there kissing each other for long minutes, before she broke the kiss. "I think I should go home now." She whispered.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"You can't want me around, not the way I made you feel."</p>
<p>"I think that what Clara just put you through, how she made you feel, it at least gives us room to talk. If you leave, we can't talk, can we?"</p>
<p>"No, I guess not."</p>
<p>I pulled her to me again and slid my hand up to her head to hold her. Her hair was wet and smelled of sex. "You're a mess." I whispered.</p>
<p>She laughed a short little chuckle. "I imagine I'm pretty nasty looking."</p>
<p>"Didn't say that. You're still every bit as beautiful as the day I fell over you and broke that bottle of spaghetti sauce all over you."</p>
<p>"I was a mess then too."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but it was kinda fun to clean up, wasn't it?" I chuckled softly.</p>
<p>"It was." She agreed.</p>
<p>"Think we can start there?"</p>
<p>"Go back to that again? Start over?"</p>
<p>"We've come way too far, to just start over. How about just a reboot? Think we can find a way to do that?"</p>
<p>"I'm willing to try," she whispered.</p>
<p>"Then I suppose we need to undress you. Come on." I said, letting go of her, so we could go into the house.</p>
<p>"Why? What's the matter with right here?"</p>
<p>"Out here?"</p>
<p>"Why not? It'd be different, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>"It would." I agreed.</p>
<p>"Then do it." She said with a little grin, stepping back a few inches to give us room between each other. I reached down and found the bottom of her shirt and pulled it slowly up. "I'm afraid the underwear I have on isn't nearly as good looking as the stuff I had on that first day."</p>
<p>"No?" I asked, as I pulled the shirt up, making her lift her arms, so I could pull the shirt up over her head. I tossed it aside and then reached around her back to unclip the bra she had on. It was certainly a far cry from the little lace bra she had on that first time that allowed her nipples to stick out the front of the bra. It was what she had worn to her date the night before, but one that the date never even got to see. I slipped the padded bra off and tossed it onto the table. I reached for her waist and undid the pants. They were baggy enough that I was able to easily get them pushed down. I knelt down in front of her to help get her shoes off and the pants as well. She stood in a pair of plain white panties. She obviously didn't plan on having sex with me, or even showing off her underwear. At least that much of what she had said was truthful. I slipped her panties down and helped her out of them, leaving her standing naked on the deck.</p>
<p>"Someone has a hardon." She whispered, stepping back to me and pressing herself against me.</p>
<p>"Someone looks sexy as hell, standing out here naked," I answered.</p>
<p>"That sexy woman has watched you come twice now, and it hasn't been with me. I'm really horny for you, for your cock. The first time we cleaned up, I didn't manage to get that into me until we were in the shower. How about we try a little sooner this time?" She let go of my body and stepped to the railing. She looked over it at the courtyard below us, rested her hands on the railing, and stepped back, bending over until her chest was almost horizontal. She pushed her butt out at me and waited, wiggling it side to side. "Well? Just like the first time, no promises, just sex."</p>
<p>"No promises." I agreed, as I stepped behind her. I grabbed my hardon and rubbed the tip of my head up and down her wet slit, letting it spread the delicate inner lips, of her fully shaved pussy. I worked it a little deeper, and then found the entrance to her depths. She moaned loudly, as I pressed myself into her. I got a couple inches into her before my bare cock grabbed at her lips. I started to stroke in short little moves, pulling back enough to wet her lips with her own juices, before pushing in again. It took a good half dozen of those strokes, before I was sliding fully in and out of her pussy, her moans growing almost with each stroke. She was always a little vocal, but today she chose to keep it to just moans, gasps and grunts. It didn't matter though, because I could still tell just how much she was enjoying my attentions. I couldn't help wondering, if she enjoyed Alex as much, as she was enjoying me, and in a rather stupid move, I asked.</p>
<p>"No, I didn't." She grunted. "He didn't feel nearly as good in me as you do. He was awkward, rushed things too much and isn't nearly as big as you are."</p>
<p>With a response like that, I had to assume that she was being honest. I needed to know she was being honest, but there wasn't any way to prove it. I was going to have to take her word for it.</p>
<p>I continued to stroke into her, feeling her body respond, her pussy began to tighten as it always did right before she climaxed. "Remember the first time?" I asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>"You mean you coming in me before I could come?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I don't plan on repeating that today."</p>
<p>"No? What if I make you?"</p>
<p>"Make me what?"</p>
<p>"Come first." She grunted.</p>
<p>"Try it, if you think you can." I answered.</p>
<p>I felt her change the way she was standing, arching her back and pushing her butt at me further. I knew what she was doing. I'd felt her do it before. She knew exactly where the sensitive spot under my head was and how to change her position to make sure it rubbed along her vaginal wall. Two could play that game though. I let go of her hips and reached a hand down around her thigh and reached my fingers between her legs. It took a few moments to find her clit and begin to rub it, stroking the tips of three of my fingers across it, so that each one bent it slightly as it bounced over.</p>
<p>I grinned to myself as she gasped at the new sensation, my cock thrusting a little harder into her. I drove the head of my cock hard into the end of her vagina, sliding my head across her cervix, just before it hit the end. I knew what she had to be feeling and I was confident that between my fingers on her clit and my thrusting I was going to get her to go first. I listened to her moans and gasps grow, little grunts sneaking in as well, as she tried to keep herself from climaxing. I had the advantage, I'd already come twice and had just been fucking Marsha.</p>
<p>"Oh God! You're gonna win!" She cried loudly, as her legs started to tremble. "OHHHHH FUCK YES!" she screamed, like she typically did as she climaxed. I felt her pussy clench around me, her legs and arms trembling uncontrollably. She gripped the railing as I thrust harder, jamming my cock harder into her, trying to push her climax even higher. She cried out again, this time as her body jerked hard. This time I felt something I hadn't ever felt her do. Her pussy gushed her juices down my legs, as she screamed that she was coming.</p>
<p>"Oh shit." I grunted, as my body suddenly jerked hard and jammed my cock into her. The sudden thrust pushed her toward the railing, pushing her to the railing so far that her bare C cup breasts were hanging over the railing, the two of us leaning against it, both of us off balance as my cock spurted, deep in her spasming pussy. I was unable to gather my balance for long seconds, as my body jerked over and over, filling her with my cum. I shakily pushed myself off her butt, my still leaking cock pulling out of her, as I stepped back. I held her hips and pulled her back, until she could get her feet under herself again.</p>
<p>Laughing, she turned to face me and hugged me tightly. We stood with her bare ass pressed to the railing, kissing each other. "I think we gave a few guys a free shot." She giggled, when we broke the kiss.</p>
<p>"A free look doesn't bother me." I answered breathlessly. "As long as it's only a look."</p>
<p>"I promise, nothing but looks, as long as we're together."</p>
<p>"Are we? Together?"</p>
<p>"As far as I'm concerned, we are. We might be having a problem, but I'm not ready to call it over. Are you?"</p>
<p>"I was."</p>
<p>"But you're not now?"</p>
<p>"I'm thinking on it."</p>
<p>"Something still bothers you?"</p>
<p>"The fifteen guys that had a run on you," I answered honestly.</p>
<p>"You know, I was serious. I'll give you fifteen of my girlfriends. I'm sure I can find fifteen that want a good fuck."</p>
<p>"Something about that doesn't seem right."</p>
<p>"How about we think about solutions while we shower. I need my hair washed and I know how much you love washing my hair."</p>
<p>"I loved washing your hair when I had a hardon and could wash your hair with my dick inside you." I chuckled.</p>
<p>"So, I'm sure we can find a way to get you hard again."</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>"Okay. Let's see what happens." I agreed. We released each other and walked into the house. "Where's Marsha?"</p>
<p>"She felt like it was time for her to go home. She said you'd understand if she broke her promise to stay with you, while Jen was here. You know, you're a lucky man Ken. You have two women that love you more than they can express."</p>
<p>"Two?"</p>
<p>"Jen and Marsha. That woman is very much in love with you. Why else would she have done what she did today? Not many women would have, but she did, even though she didn't want to."</p>
<p>I frowned and nodded. I knew she was right. I didn't before today, but now, yeah, I knew it wasn't just words. It was all the actions of the last three years that added up to one word. Love. The question was what was I to do, if anything.</p>
<p>"Come on, let's go get cleaned up!" Jen coaxed, pulling on Clara's hand as well.</p>
<p>It was a tight squeeze, but the three of us managed to all get showered together, our bodies covered with soap, rubbing together against each other until my dick was most definitely hard. Clara stood behind me and fed me into Jen's pussy, and then squeezed me into a Ken sandwich to keep me inside her while I washed Marsha's climax out of her hair. I agreed to stay naked with them the rest of the evening, and for them to spend the night, though with some stipulations. The first was that while I had forgiven her for what happened with Alex, there was still the matter of fifteen other guys I was grappling with, and I wasn't ready to just jump in again. Since Clara had 'purchased' her ability to help her friend, by letting her husband fuck three women at once. Jen convinced me to allow Clara to be my first 'cheat', toward fifteen, and working together, give her as many climaxes as we could before morning.</p>
<p>Clara was limited to not having me come inside her pussy, but she was more than willing to take the three loads she coaxed from me various other ways. One in her mouth, one all over her tits, and in a first for me, one in her butt. By the time we finally fell asleep, the three of us sharing my queen-sized bed, Jen and I had given her no less than six climaxes.</p>
<p>"I want you to know," Jen whispered in the morning before the two left. "That I want you to trust me again. So, I'm not going have sex with anyone else while we work this out. I know you don't think that this will fix things, but I want you to know, I'm still intending to send you fourteen more women to rock your world."</p>
<p>"I don't believe that'll make what I feel go away." I answered quietly.</p>
<p>"Let me try at least, okay?"</p>
<p>"Alright."</p>
<p>"After I get back, maybe Wednesday or so, can I come over and spend the night? We don't HAVE to have sex or anything if you don't want, but I'd really like the chance to be with you and show you that I do still love you."</p>
<p>"We'll see." I answered not wanting to make any decision while I was still in the aftermath of a night of hot sex.</p>
<p>"One more thing. After what happened yesterday, with Marsha, if you want to...you know... I won't count that as cheating. I'm sort of hoping that you do, and you decided you like sex with me, like being with me, more, but I think it's something you should explore. If we do fix this, I want it to be for all the right reasons, so it lasts. I don't want you to have regrets about not exploring what's right there. Okay?"</p>
<p>"I'm never going to understand women," I said, shaking my head.</p>
<p>"You're not supposed to," she said, before giving me a final kiss and then turning to leave.</p>
<p>I sat for a long time after they left, trying to make sense of the last two days. It was filled with emotional swings that left me feeling exhausted. I felt like I loved Jen, but at the same time I was struggling with what she had done, not once, but multiple times. I was also struggling with Marsha. She'd been living next to me for three years, and I never knew she had any more feeling for me, than a good friend. Yes, we chatted almost daily, yes, we would occasionally do favors for each other, and yes, when my last girlfriend declared she wanted to be a lesbian and no longer have sex with me, Marsha was there to console me and help me work though it all. When I started to fall in love with Jen and told Marsha, she celebrated with me and told me how lucky I was. All this time, she had feelings for me she kept concealed.</p>
<p>It was almost lunch time. I knew from long experience that she rarely skipped church, and would be home soon. I wanted to talk to her. No, I needed to talk to her. I taped a note to her door, left mine ajar so she could come in and dropped onto the sofa to wait. Maybe I expected too much, or maybe I completely misjudged the situation, but when I heard her apartment door open and close, rather hard, I knew that I'd done something wrong.</p>
<p>"Marsha? Can I talk to you?" I called through her front door after knocking at least three times. The response I got was for her stereo to be turned up. I walked back to my apartment and sat down, listening to her music through the apartment wall. "What an idiot!" I said to myself, remembering what she'd said the other day about hearing Jen and myself through the bedroom wall. She had to have heard last night as well. I guess I don't blame her for being upset, not after what she did for me. What she didn't know, was that not once, after the shower, did I have sex with Jen, or even stick it into her. Jen's cries of pleasure were at the hands and mouth of her best friend, not me.</p>
<p>Now, how to make her understand? I sat for long minutes before it finally dawned on me. I could do the same thing she did. I walked to the balcony, stepped out onto it and stood looking at the wall that separated mine from hers. If she could do it, so could I! Dressed in only shorts, I headed back in for a pair of shoes, and then went back to try this. Using the wall as a hand hold, I climbed onto the balcony railing. If I fell, it wasn't going to be pretty, but then, if she could do this, so could I! I pressed myself to the wall as tightly as I could and reached around to find a hand grip. The vertical siding had three quarter inch strips every foot or so, and by holding onto those I was able to lean myself out, step a foot around the wall and onto her railing. It was a simple matter to repeat the process for my second foot and then drop down onto her deck.</p>
<p>I stood at her sliding glass door, hesitant to just walk in on her. I waited until she stepped out of her bedroom, wearing nothing but a very sexy looking lace panty and bra set. She really did look very nice. No, not playboy, but I couldn't help but start getting a hardon as my body remembered what it felt like to be sliding in and out of her hot pussy. I stood there, waiting for her to notice me. She walked to the kitchen, got several things out of the refrigerator and set them on the table, still not noticing me. I finally tapped on the glass, startling her so that she cried out in surprise.</p>
<p>She walked to the door and stood on the other side of the glass, not opening the door. "I don't want to talk to you." She said, loud enough for me to hear through the glass panes over the stereo.</p>
<p>"I know, but I need to talk to you."</p>
<p>"I don't want to talk to you. Go back to your own place."</p>
<p>"Not until we talk!"</p>
<p>"No!" she said with a scowl before turning and walking back to the table.</p>
<p>I stood there, trying to figure out what to do to get her to open the door and talk to me. She sat at the table, eating the sandwich she made, in nothing but her bra and panties, sitting so she could look my way and show me that she was ignoring me. I had an idea. Crazy, but maybe it'd work. I took off my shorts, leaving me in nothing but my shoes, walked to the railing and threw my shorts around the wall onto my deck. I walked back to the door, now naked but for my shoes. I stood in front of the door, in full view of her, and began to slowly stroke my dick, which was already hard from seeing her in the sexy lace underwear.</p>
<p>She'd like to think that she was ignoring me, but I could tell by the hard nipples poking the bra front out, that she was watching exactly what I was doing. I stood there, stroking myself, my dick pointed at her, letting my hand slowly slide the full length of my dick, my hand closing over my engorged head with each trip it made. Her eating slowed and she finally put down the sandwich. I watched as she got up and walked to the window. I waited for her to come open the door, but to my surprise, she pulled the blinds over the window.</p>
<p>I stood there like an idiot, my hardon in my hand, wondering what I was going to do now. She had a little table on her deck like I did, and I pulled out a chair and dropped into it. Could I climb back to my own place? Sure, but I'd be giving everyone one hell of a show, and being a weekend, there were a lot of people coming and going in the courtyard. I could see a group of young ladies near one of the grills, starting some charcoal. I could see the pool on the far side of the green, already starting to get busy. Yeah, climbing back would be troublesome at best. It had, in fact, been a stupid idea.</p>
<p>I sat for at least half an hour before the curtain opened and Marsha slid the door back. She was standing, wearing an over long t-shirt that hinted that she didn't have shorts on under it, but still covered all the important parts. "Go home. I don't want to talk to you." She said, turning and walking away from the still open sliding glass door.</p>
<p>I got up and walked into her house, closing the door behind me. "But I need to talk to you." I said quietly, walking to where she was standing with her back to me.</p>
<p>"No, you don't. You made up with Jennifer. That's what I wanted you to do. Go be happy with her."</p>
<p>I stepped a little closer and touched one of her shoulders before letting my hand drop again. "No, I haven't made up with Jen. I told her I forgave her for what happened with Alex. I haven't forgiven her, and I don't know that I can, for the other fifteen times she cheated on me."</p>
<p>"Didn't sound like it, last night!"</p>
<p>"I wondered if that was the problem. Well, for what it's worth, I didn't have sex with her all night. Did I have her in bed last night? Yeah, I did. But I didn't have sex with her. I had sex with Clara because she bought the ability to have sex with me, in front of Jen, by letting her husband have sex with three women. I kinda took pity on her and I agreed to give her as many orgasms as I could, since it was going to be a one-time thing for them. And I did. But I didn't give any to Jen. Those were between her and Clara."</p>
<p>She turned in front of me and looked up at me, her chest almost touching mine, as I stood naked in front of her. "So, those cries of pleasure from her, they weren't with you?"</p>
<p>"No, I made Clara climax three or four times, the rest were her and Jen doing each other, while I just lay there and watched."</p>
<p>"So, after the balcony, you didn't fuck her again? I thought that when you told her you were doing a reboot, that meant that...that you were going to..."</p>
<p>"No, it didn't mean that at all. It just meant that I'd try and date her again and see if there was any chance we could find a way to work it out. We showered together, and Clara got me hard and tried to get me to have sex with her, but all I did in the shower was hold my dick inside Jen while I washed your cum out of her hair."</p>
<p>She looked at me, her eyes darting side to side slightly, like she was examining my eyes. She suddenly spread her arms and launched herself at me, wrapping her arms and legs around me. Her body hit mine with such force that the two of us fell to the floor with me below her. She reached for her shirt tail and pulled it up and tossed it aside. She reached behind her and freed her big soft tits from the lace bra and tossed it aside too. She pushed up off of me only long enough to push the panties off, only pulling one leg out, leaving them around her right ankle, as she knelt back down, her legs outside of mine. She grabbed my partly hard dick and then stopped, frozen, looking at me. Her hand gently began to stroke my partly hard dick, slowly causing it to grow.</p>
<p>She stared at me, as she lifted herself on her knees and worked my mostly rigid dick between her lips, rubbing it back and forth. She never broke her stare at my eyes, as she lowered herself down, my fat shaft pushing slowly into her, as she wiggled and moved herself on me. Once she had me fully inside her hot depths, she leaned down toward me, her tits pressed to my chest, her lips inches from mine.</p>
<p>"I told you things yesterday. I meant them. I don't know if you do, or can, love me, but I know that I love you. I have for a long time. It was hard watching you and Jen connect and grow the way I wanted us to do. But I couldn't tell you. I wouldn't ever mess up something like that. I'm just not that selfish. But if you're just starting to date her again, I want you to know, I want you. I love you. This time I'm going to do everything I can to get you to love me, not her. That includes doing anything you ask of me. You want me to fuck you on the balcony? I'll do it. You want me to fuck you in the middle of the courtyard? I'll do it. I'll kiss you and touch you and fuck you so much that you wont even have time to realize Jen is still around. All you have to do is say one thing. Tell me you want me to. Tell me that I have a chance, that you care, and you want me to be part of the equation. I might not win, but this time it won't be because I didn't try."</p>
<p>"If I remember right, you have a passport, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, why?" she asked me curiously.</p>
<p>"What if I asked you to run away with me for a week?"</p>
<p>"All I need to do is make one phone call, and then I'm yours. No matter what you want to do or where you take me, I'm yours."</p>
<p>"Well, I have a weeks' vacation and reservations at a very private little grass hut out over the water on an island in the Caribbean. Plane leaves at eight tonight. If you want, I'd really enjoy having you come with me."</p>
<p>"Your...honeymoon trip?" She asked quietly.</p>
<p>"It was. Too late to cancel the reservations, so I'm paying either way. Might be a good time to explore what we feel for each other."</p>
<p>"And no interruptions from Jennifer?"</p>
<p>"I plan on turning my phone off as soon as the plane takes off and not turning it back on until next Sunday, when we get home. It'd be just you and me. Are you interested?"</p>
<p>She dropped her face to mine and kissed me quickly, before lifting her face again. "O damn, I have so much to do. I need to go get a new swim suit, and some shorts and stuff, and oh yeah, something sexy to wear to bed with you. I have so much to do!" She said, as she pushed up off my chest.</p>
<p>I reached for her hips and held her in place. "Slow down. I don't care what you wear to bed, because I plan on taking it off of you anyway. And as far as a swim suit, I think what you're wearing right now is perfect."</p>
<p>"But I'm naked!"</p>
<p>I grinned and looked up at her. "And where we're going it doesn't matter. Just bring plenty of sun block so the important parts don't get burned."</p>
<p>She looked down at me. "That's what you were going to do with Jen? Go naked the whole week?"</p>
<p>"It is," I answered, wondering if the look on her face meant she was going to turn me down.</p>
<p>She nodded slowly. "Alright. I never done that, but alright."</p>
<p>"Good. Does that mean we have time to finish this?" I asked, slipping one hand from her hip to her crotch. I stroked her pussy lips and dipped a finger between her lips.</p>
<p>"There's always going to be time to do that!" She grinned, as she leaned over again, this time leaning her weight on her hands. She started to lift and lower herself on my dick, which had, thankfully, stayed hard enough for her to do this. Her tits swung under her chest, her hardening nipples dragging back and forth across my chest, as they swung in time with her strokes. Up and down her hips moved, my dick thickening and lengthening, as her motions excited me further. In and out my dick slid, pushing deep into her velvety soft vagina.</p>
<p>I watched her face, listened to her moans, let my cock feel her tightness and wetness. I listened to her body, learning as much as I could. I was going to have a week to find out about other positions and situations, but this one, here, now, I wanted to be as good as I could make it, for both of us. One thing Jen always said, I was a patient and attentive lover, knowing exactly when to speed up and slow down, to push her orgasms just as fast as they needed to be, to get really hard climaxes. I was going to use every bit of that now. Yes, I needed to talk to her. But I needed this WITH her almost as much.</p>
<p>Her breathing became more ragged as she worked up and down my shaft. I slipped my hands between us and captured her tits, squeezing them and kneading the huge soft mounds, as she pushed her hips down harder at me. I could tell her climax was nearing, and I wanted to come with her, but I wasn't there yet. I let go of her tits, slipped my arms around her and rolled us over, ending up on top of her. She gave a startled cry, and then giggled, as she spread her legs wide to give me access.</p>
<p>I watched her watch me as I started to stroke, slowly at first, moving my angle slightly to find that perfect spot, the angle that would push me to the same place she was. I felt the velvety softness of her vaginal walls stroke along my shaft and tease under my head, knowing that what I was doing was good for me, but had slowed her progress. That was okay, because in a few moments I was going to change things again. I waited until I could feel my climax teasing forward, the warmth and tingle spreading. I lowered my hips a bit so my head slid along the top of her vagina, and lowered my face to one of her soft breasts.</p>
<p>"Oh God yes!" she gasped, as I drew her nipple into my mouth and gently nibbled it. My strokes pushed both of us closer, her hips starting to rock in time with my strokes. Now was the hard part. It was awkward, but I wasn't going to care in a few moments. I moved my hand from holding me up, down to her butt. I curled my hand under her cheek, until I could feel her wet lips with my fingertips, my shaft sliding in and out. I shifted my fingers up a few inches and was rewarded with a gasp, as my fingertip found her clit. I rubbed the tip of my finger across her clit as I drove harder into her, her nipple gently gripped between my teeth. "OH SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT!" She cried, as her legs, sticking in the air, started to tremble against my body. Her pussy clenched around my stroking cock, as she started to come. I thrust a little harder, pushing her climax a little higher, and driving mine to the tipping point. "OH FUCK!" She screamed, every bit as loud as she had the day before. I felt her juices spurting from her pussy onto me, as my own climax took hold. I held myself deep in her, as my body jerked and spasmed, sending shot after shot of hot sticky cum deep in her pussy.</p>
<p>I lay on top of her, panting, my hands now holding me up enough, so that I didn't crush her. I lowered my face to hers and she wrapped her arms around my neck and pulled me down for long wet kiss. Her lips sucked my lips and tongue, and her tongue teased mine playfully, as we both tried to breath at the same time. Finally, she eased her grip on me, so I could lift my face from hers. "If that's any example of what you plan on doing for the next week, I won't ever wear clothes around you again." She giggled. "God that felt incredible."</p>
<p>"I hope that we find more than sex incredible."</p>
<p>"So do I. I'd about given up on ever finding a guy that would care for me."</p>
<p>"You mean again?"</p>
<p>She looked at me for long seconds, and then nodded. "I don't count him. He didn't care for me, he just wanted me to be his sex toy. I don't think he ever would have married me. He always would have found an excuse."</p>
<p>"So, how about you be my sex toy, but at the same time, we try to find out if we can work as more than friends?"</p>

<p>"I think it'd be a lot of fun learning." She whispered. "Now, I DO need to go shopping, just because you love seeing me naked, I want to surprise you with some wrappings and trimmings."</p>
<p>"Alright. Bring over whatever you want to pack. We only need one suitcase. We have to be at the airport at six, that means leaving here at five thirty."</p>
<p>"Trust me, I won't be late!" She said, before lifting her head to kiss me again. "At least not as long as you let me up so I can do that shopping." I let her roll us over, my softened dick slipping from her. She climbed to her feet and held a hand out for me. After I was standing again, she pressed herself to me again and kissed me softly. "Your sure this is what you want?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure." I answered. She grinned and turned away. I slapped her ass gently, as she headed to the bedroom to dress. "Just one problem."</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"I'm, uh, locked out of my apartment!"</p>
<p>She stuck her head out and looked at me with a crooked grin. "Blue key fob in the drawer by the door. Just make sure I get it back, just in case I have to let myself into your place again."</p>
<p>"Got it." I answered, as I headed for the door, feeling surprisingly happy, given what the weekend had brought to my doorstep. Maybe I'd been looking in the wrong place the whole time. Maybe love really was just next door.</p>
