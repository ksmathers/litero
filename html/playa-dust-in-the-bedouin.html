<p>My phone's sharp ringtone cut through the muted sounds of my van's stereo - and instantly reminded me that I had left the damn thing laying on the driver's seat before I had crawled my ass here under the van. With a grunt, a wiggle, and a shoulder roll that had I learned crawling under barbed wire, I managed to get to the phone by the third ring. I saw who it was even as I one finger pushed the button to answer.</p>
<p>My sister, Olivia. Oh, joy ... .</p>
<p>"Yellow," I mumbled in my normal greeting.</p>
<p>Her dulcet tones rang out on the speaker phone "Hey, big brother. How's it going?"</p>
<p>Picking up a blue rag, I tried absently to wipe grease from my hands. "Oh, it's going just fine. What do you need?"</p>
<p>She gave an almighty sigh, "John! Why do you always think I need something?"</p>
<p>I chuckled. "Because you called, Olivia. You only call when you need something from me, you know that. So what's up? Car broke down or something?"</p>
<p>My sister gave it a moment. "No. The car is fine." Then she paused as if trying to make a decision.</p>
<p>"Just ask, already," I sighed, hearing the intake of breath that normally preludes a long request.</p>
<p>"I need to borrow a tent! For a week, um, like next week." She paused. "Oh, no, I'm sorry. It's the week after next."</p>
<p>Well, that's a new one at least.</p>
<p>"A tent for week after next, huh? Olivia, unless I'm wrong you've not been camping since Dad took you last and I think you were twelve at the time. And you hated it."</p>
<p>I could almost picture her exasperated expression. "That was a long time ago, and this is going to be different. I'm going with a bunch of friends out to Nevada for the Burning Man Festival."</p>
<p>Given what I know about my younger sister and her friends, I instantly had a few horrified thoughts about all of them out camping together ... certainly anywhere where there was fire involved. Let alone in the desert.</p>
<p>"Um... ." I hesitated for a moment pondering if I could or would be held as an accessory to insanity if I let her borrow one of my tents. And just how many people I could be sued by?</p>
<p>"So can I use it?"</p>
<p>I mentally shrugged. "Which one you want? I've got several, after all."</p>
<p>"Well, nothing too complex to put up. We're all pretty much novices about this ... well, except for Victoria. She's been to the festival a couple of times before."</p>
<p>With a silent sigh of regret for ever answering my phone, I got to my feet and asked it more slowly. "How big of a tent do you want?"</p>
<p>"Oh. Um, I don't know. Big enough for me and my luggage, I guess."</p>
<p>I picked up the phone and walked over to the side of the garage where I store my camping equipment. "Well, that narrows it down a good bit. Okay, I have a nine-by-twelve Coleman tent that would give you plenty of room. It's pretty simple to put up."</p>
<p>"That would be great! I'll swing by and pick it up this weekend." She was almost giggling with happiness. "Thank you so much." Olivia made a kissing sound and hung up.</p>
<p>" ... or I got a few other choices that are smaller."</p>
<p>With a deep sense of resignation, I dug out the nine-by-twelve and placed it by the door so I could set it up and let it air out. With a mental reminder to take the phone with me this time, I crawled back under my van.</p>
<p>Two days later I was in the middle of doing a bit of my hobby crafting - sandblasted wooden walking sticks - when I felt my phone vibrate on my hip. I gave it a quick look, then shut off the sanding cabinet and pulled off my headphones. Taking my phone off my hip, I sat it on the worktable and hit the button to answer and for speaker phone.</p>
<p>"Yeah, sis, What's up? I've got your tent aired out for you."</p>
<p>"Thanks, but I've got a new problem."</p>
<p>Picking up my soda, I took a slow sip before answering. "So what is it now?"</p>
<p>"My friend Victoria tripped over her cat, and broke her leg!"</p>
<p>Okay, don't laugh. It won't be taken well. "Sorry to hear that."</p>
<p>"You don't understand! She was to be our camp organizer at Burning Man. She's been there before, and has done a ton of outdoorsy type stuff." Olivia took a deep breath, which I almost dreaded hearing. "Without her, we're all going to be pretty much lost. None of us have ever even slept in a tent, except me, and that was years ago."</p>
<p>"Okay ... so what do you need?"</p>
<p>"I need you! You've done tons of this kind of stuff! Between camping with Dad and your time in the military, you've all but lived in a tent your whole life!"</p>
<p>"Olivia, I can't exactly just go spend a week with you and your friends in the desert."</p>
<p>I could hear the exasperated huff. "Well, why not? You are self-employed so you can take off whenever you want to. Unlike all of us, we've had to schedule this with our bosses for months. We are all terminally screwed! And we were all pledged to help work on an art project, so the artist will be short-handed if we don't show up. But none of us know what to do, so we will be there just winging it day by day. And I know that will be a disaster. Surely you can take the time to give me a little bit of help? I mean it's not like I ask you for all that much."</p>
<p>"Olivia, Olivia ... hush." I took a long deep breath. "Just what all does this entail and when is the trip going to be?"</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you thank you, thank you!"</p>
<p>I cut her off in mid joygasm. "I've not said yes, yet! And if you can't calmly tell me what the whole deal is I'm not going to."</p>
<p>My sister took a deep breath and revved up to full caffeine mode.</p>
<p>"Okay, well Victoria went there two years ago and made friends with an artist named Kimberly. Last year she went back and helped Kimberly with her next project. So this time she was asked to come back. Kind of like a guest of the art project. She managed to get us a couple of tickets and we all grabbed up the rest on our own. So now Kimberly won't have Victoria there to help her, and we don't even know where to get started with setting up a camp. Kimberly said she would try to help us, but we know that she will be really busy with what she is doing, so we're trying to find a way to not be a burden to her."</p>
<p>I absently scratched wood dust out of my beard. "By laying the whole burden on me? Okay ... um, how and where would I have to go to get one of these tickets? And how much are they?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you can't, they're all sold out! But I can get you Victoria's ticket." She eagerly leaped at my simple question. "So does that mean you will go? Please! Pretty, please!"</p>
<p>I rubbed the building tension between my eyebrows as she begged. "Yeah ..." I finally said, mostly to shut her up. "How many people will I be playing camp chaperon for?"</p>
<p>"Um, there is eight of us ... well, eight including you." She paused for a moment. "And me, too, I mean."</p>
<p>I gave a resigned sigh to my future mental state before this was over. "Okay, I take it everyone has been trying to scrounge up tents? I mean since none of you have ever been camping, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, pretty much. A couple of them, Jim and Tim said they would be buying them a new one just for the trip."</p>
<p>"Well, give all of them a call and tell them to hold up. I'll simply bring my big tent and we can all camp under it. It's made for desert camping, and I know it can take whatever this festival can throw at it. Is there someplace where I can get some information about this ... whatever it is ... without pulling so many teeth?"</p>
<p>Olivia paused, startled. "Um, yeah they have a website. And there are a lot of videos on YouTube about it too. I've been watching a few; it looks like it's going to be so much fun."</p>
<p>"Well, okay tell the other six people to try and give me some kind of idea as to what all they will be bringing so I can plan around that. And please, please, please, you do the same for me."</p>
<p>She gave a sniffle. "Oh, thank you, brother. You have no idea how much this means to me. I would simply be lost without you."</p>
<p>I chuckled. "You're welcome and ... that's what she said."</p>
<p>Olivia gave an exasperated laugh and hung up.</p>
<p>Brushing wood dust off my pants, I looked outside at the small green and tan tent I had set up to air out for her to use. I gave a mental sigh for the wasted effort. Walking over to the side of the garage where I keep my camping gear, I shoved a few things aside till I could get a hand on the huge "jellyroll" of dark goat-wool canvas.</p>
<p>I was already mentally running down the large list of things I was going to need to round up.</p>
<p>"The van and the trailer," I muttered to myself, then grunted as I squat-lifted the hundred and ninety pounds of tightly rolled goat-wool canvas tent into my arms. The smell of it hit me and brought back instant memories.</p>
<p>Some were good. Some were bad. Some were flat horrifying.</p>
<p>Shrugging past that, I made my way out to my van.</p>
<p>Given that the first time I was going to be meeting the majority of these people - who I was going to be camping/living with for a week - only after we got there, wasn't ideal.</p>
<p>But then Jim and Tim showed up at my house with my sister.</p>
<p>Maybe my meeting these people before we get there wasn't that great of an idea either.</p>
<p>Now I think I need to make sure we understand that, having been in the military during the "Don't ask, don't tell period" I've been around my fair share of gay men ... but they all tended to be a bit discrete about it.</p>
<p>There is nothing under the sun discrete about Tim.</p>
<p>But then I guess, when going to a place called Burning Man, bringing along a "flamer" is probably not even that unusual.</p>
<p>"Oh, good lord, hun! This place is absolutely gorgeous." Tim followed my sister from the gravel driveway up to the front porch where I was sitting. "I feel like I'm on the set of Grizzly Adams. Oh, and speaking of bears ... you must be John. How do you do? Your lovely sister has been telling us all about you." He offered me his hand. "I'm Tim, but most people call me Timbo. Either is fine for me as long as you call. Oh, and this is Jim." He turned to point at the slightly older-looking man walking up behind him. "Jim, hun, come say hello to this gorgeous man. I saw him first, though, so hands to yourself."</p>
<p>Jim walked up, offering me his hand. He looked to be about my age, mid to late thirties, but his goatee mustache and beard had already gone a bone white color and his hair was sun-bleached a pale blond. He had an incredibly solid muscle tone and a dark tan. My first thought was a surfer.</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you. Can I get you both some tea or soda?" I offered. Olivia had already vanished inside after a quick hug. She reappeared almost instantly with a bottle of soda from my fridge.</p>
<p>Tim answered for them both. "Oh, we're good. We stopped down the road at that Waffle House and positively stuffed ourselves. I've drank enough coffee to have me floating." He tilted his head gave me a looking over, then went right to business. "So, Olivia here told us not to go buy a tent. She said we were all going to be sleeping in the big one you have. Not that I mind things being cozy, but is it a large enough tent for all of us? There are what? Eight of us?" He looked at my sister. "Well, seven adults and one half-grown child."</p>
<p>My twenty-five-year-old sister reached over and tried to punch his arm.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's more than big enough. It's a fifty by fifty Bedouin." I began to explain. "Once it's up we'll hang interior curtain walls, and those will section off the front and back and give us private sleeping areas, but still leaves a big common room for sitting and eating."</p>
<p>Jim had perked up. "A Bedouin? Like a desert tribes of Egypt ... Bedouin tent?"</p>
<p>I nodded, taking a sip of my tea. "Same style. Mine was made by the Kochi nomads of Afghanistan. I was gifted it," I said, anticipating the next question.</p>
<p>Jim shook his head in awe. "It's traditionally made? That is one hell of a gift."</p>
<p>Giving a small shrug, I tried to change the subject. "So, I've got the tent. I'm bringing a large ground cloth and a half dozen rugs to floor it out. I've got a couple of folding tables and a camping kitchen setup I can bring for cooking. We're going to need chairs for everybody." I picked up my folded notebook and looked at my list. "I've got lanterns, both battery and propane for light. And I'm bringing in a fifty-five-gallon plastic barrel of drinking water. But that will still leave us about thirty-five gallons short of the water eight people will need for the week, and I don't have the room to bring that."</p>
<p>Jim gave a nod. "We can grab that. I can grab some food-grade five-gallon buckets from work. I'm a chef, by trade, so I can handle planning the meals and cooking for the week unless anyone else wants to jump in and fix something."</p>
<p>Tim reached over and patted my hand. "He makes the absolutely best banana bread pancakes. With a walnut brandy syrup! Extraordinary! I just know I will put on ten pounds on this one trip!"</p>
<p>My sister and Jim both laughed so I felt I should as well, not that I could really get the humor. I looked back at my list. "Okay, next. From what I saw on the YouTube videos, bringing a bike along to get around on is almost a requirement." I looked up at the three of them. "Does everybody have one?"</p>
<p>Jim and my sister nodded, but Tim shook his head.</p>
<p>"I've got me one of those One Wheel boards." He shifted in his chair like he was antsy. "I'm going to be zooming around the playa all week like Aladdin on his magic carpet. Besides, after a few nights of partying, riding on a bicycle seat just will not work for me."</p>
<p>After a second my sister all but screamed. "TIM! Oversharing information."</p>
<p>He gave her a confused look. "What? My back hurts when I spend the night dancing." He started to ask me a question then stopped and cut her a look back. "Oh! You filthy-minded little hussy. That is not at all what I meant!"</p>
<p>As the days rolled past faster and faster I found myself dropping back into the old patterns I had learned in my years in the military. Most days I would wake before dawn, and the old "shit, shower, and shave" became a thing again. I would be out at one of my sheds finishing a project or fiddling with camping gear till my sister woke up.</p>
<p>Olivia had surprised me when Tim and Jim got ready to leave and she took a bag and a couple of Rubbermaid totes from the back of their truck. Pink plastic of course. Apparently, since it was only going to be a few more days till we had to head out to Black Rock Desert, there was no real reason for her to travel all the way back home and then all the way back out here. She had decided that she would simply stay here and ride in with me.</p>
<p>Mind you, if she had just asked me... .</p>
<p>Luckily for me, she and I are so opposite when it comes to almost everything that we do, we don't clash personality-wise. Mostly we simply avoid each other, completely unintentionally, since we are doing different things. I'm outside my shop working, she is on her computer.</p>
<p>When I read about the lack of Wi-Fi signals out on the playa I began to have some concerns for her mental health. I'm not sure she has gone a day without talking to at least someone online since she was twelve years old.</p>
<p>Then I began to read just what the alkali dust at Burning Man can do to electronics and began to have a few second thoughts concerning some of my own electronic gear I had been planning to take. This was very quickly becoming a situation that even my time in the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan was not going to have me fully prepared for. And, given the fact that ... among our little group ... I was going to be the most experienced that wasn't settling too well on my shoulders.</p>
<p>Sitting at my desk, laptop open before me, my elbows on the table, hands crossed before my mouth, breathing the smell of my knuckles, I began to study Burning Man like it was a military campaign I was going to have to wage war with.</p>
<p>Radical self-reliance?</p>
<p>"Whatcha reading?"</p>
<p>Walking up behind me on her bare feet, Olivia placed her chin on my shoulder and looked past my cheek at the screen.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah, the Ten Principles. I love the one on gifting, that just sounds so cool." She wrapped an arm around my chest. "I think I'm going to take along some coated wire and make those 'elephant hair' bracelets we made back in Mr. Parish's art class. You remember the ones. I know I saw you wear yours for years, even after you graduated."</p>
<p>Chuckling, I turned my head to look at her, breathing in the lingering scent of her strawberry shampoo. "I remember. I still have it around here somewhere."</p>
<p>"Have you read about the costumes?" My sister leaned over me even more and began to type out a Google search. I soon had images of people in both beautiful and silly costumes covering my screen. "I want to do something like that, I think."</p>
<p>She pointed at a woman in a thong bikini bottom, high heel boots that came to mid-thigh, and an elaborately decorative vest. All in a brilliant silvery pink.</p>
<p>I gave my sister a look trying to imagine her in such. "Do you have anything even close to that?"</p>
<p>She shook her head. "I've got a couple of cool-looking things I've packed. I've seen where people set up shops with free clothes. I'm hoping to maybe find something there. Also, Gloria is bringing a ton of clothes and I'm sure I can wear her size. And I know she won't mind."</p>
<p>"Have you asked her about doing this?"</p>
<p>Olivia shook her head. "No, but like I said I'm sure she won't mind."</p>
<p>Spinning my chair around, I looked up at her. Her long brown hair was in its familiar braid. The overly done eye shadow and contouring makeup. Compared to the outfit she was wanting to wear, she was a bit conservative in shorts and a button-up shirt.</p>
<p>Frowning, I gave it a look. One of my button-up shirts at that.</p>
<p>"Go call Gloria, and ask her if she will mind." I got to my feet, towering over her a bit given the five-inch differences in our heights. "Now."</p>
<p>"But, I'm sure_"</p>
<p>"Now."</p>
<p>She gave me a look, then shrugged and dug her pink phone out of her back pocket. "Okay, sure, But I'm sure she won't mind."</p>
<p>Nodding, I walked past her. "Hungry?"</p>
<p>Phone now glued to the right side of her face, she gave me an emphatic nod as her friend picked up. "Hey, Gloria, real quick question to make my brother happy. Do you mind if I ..."</p>
<p>Heading into the kitchen, I mentally sorted through the contents of my pantry, refrigerator, and fridge and decided that it was a pepper steak kind of night. I grabbed a bag of yellow rice and set it to cooking in the rice cooker then dug out several semi-wrinkly bell peppers. Stepping out onto the porch, I fired up the gas grill.</p>
<p>The steaks were started by the time she joined me.</p>
<p>"She said she wouldn't mind, but that she was glad I asked." Olivia was all but bouncy when she appeared. "Gloria is going to pack a few things just for me, that she said I would love. Steak?"</p>
<p>"Pepper steak and rice." I turned the four New York strip steaks; they sizzled on the hot grill nicely. "Figured that wouldn't make for too bad of an early dinner."</p>
<p>"Sounds good to me. Um ... can I have a beer? With my dinner." When I gave her an odd look she shrugged. "I know you keep your fridge normally stocked with that dark stuff, but I saw a couple of regular beers in there as well."</p>
<p>"Yeah, a friend left them. You're welcome to one or as many as you like, but ..." I pointed at a glass she had left behind last night on the table. "I thought you were strictly wine?"</p>
<p>My sister moved over to the table and had a seat. She teased the top of the empty glass with her finger. "Generally I am, but I really didn't much care for that wine. Sorry. I'm more of a Merlot or a Pinot noir type wine snob." She dinged the crystal glass with her nail. "And this stuff could strip paint it was so strong. And way too sweet."</p>
<p>"It's Port." Laughing, I turned the steaks a bit to put crosshatch grill marks on them. Not that it would matter since I was going to slice them up and toss them with peppers, but why not. "It's meant to be strong and sweet."</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>She shook her head. "A few more glasses of that and I would be a wine-drunk sister, in dire need of a diabetic testing kit." Olivia took a deep sniff. "God, that smells so good. I've been hanging out with Gloria so much and she's a vegetarian. I don't think I've had steak in months."</p>
<p>"Vegetarian, huh? We'll have to plan for that with our meals."</p>
<p>Olivia gave a small shrug. "Once we get there I'm not sure how many of us will be in camp together at one time anyway. With twenty-four-seven parties and all the cool art activities that are going on, we might be just wandering in to grab something and pass out. Least ways that is what Victoria said she did a lot of last year. I so badly wish she was going to be able to be there. You would love her. She is such a sweetheart, but will mother you to death if you let her."</p>
<p>Chuckling, I put the meat on a plate and shut off the grill. "I had a staff sergeant that was the same way."</p>
<p>My sister followed me back into the kitchen. "Wow."</p>
<p>"What?" I paused in mid-step.</p>
<p>"My brother just mentioned something about his time in the military." She parked her butt on the bar stool by the breakfast nook table where I normally take my morning coffee. "It's not a first, true, but it's as rare as finding hen's teeth."</p>
<p>I gave a dismissive shrug and began to slice the steak to toss into the frying pan with the peppers. "I went where they sent me. Did what they told me. And came back home when they let me." I paused in mid-slice. "Sorry, but I really don't like remembering some of the things I saw, so I don't bring it up."</p>
<p>She absently played with the packs of sweetener on the table. "Might help to talk about it. Not with me, but maybe with someone ... you know professional."</p>
<p>With a mild snort, I drizzled oil into the pan. It was nearly hot enough. "I'm about as sane as I ever was. No need to go giving a psychiatrist nightmares listening to me talking about stuff that's past." I looked over at the cooker. "Check the rice for me. The little green light there says it's done, but it might not be to your liking."</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes and got to her feet. "Changing the subject. Same as always."</p>
<p>Dropping a double handful of peppers into the hot oil, I shrugged. "I come by it honestly."</p>
<p>"Yeah, from Dad. He's the world's worst about never talking about things he doesn't want to." She dug a fork through the rice. "You at least don't vanish out the door and go bowling every time something awkward comes up."</p>
<p>"I was always more partial to shooting pool," I mumbled, pushing the peppers around to make sure they cooked evenly. "Easier to carry a pool cue than a sixteen-pound bowling ball."</p>
<p>"I'm serious."</p>
<p>"So am I." I left the stove and went to the fridge. I fished out two beers and popped them open on the metal opener above the trash can. "Lugging around that heavy bag? A second set of shoes? That's just crazy talk."</p>
<p>Sitting the second beer on the kitchen island, I slid it across to her.</p>
<p>With a shake of her head, she took a sip. Then a second. "Well, your taste in wine is horrible, but this is a really great beer."</p>
<p>"Like I said, a friend left it." Shrugging, I took a sip of my own much darker stout. "So tell me about Gloria, the vegetarian."</p>
<p>Olivia watched me go back to cooking knowing I had successfully switched topics. "You're not getting in her pants. She's my age and into younger men ... who will talk about their feelings."</p>
<p>Grabbing the steak, I added it and then went to work on building a thicker sauce in one corner of the pan. "Never know. It's going to be a long week out there in the desert and the nights will get awful cold."</p>
<p>My sister shook her head. "Nope. Not a chance."</p>
<p>Grabbing a large bowl, I tossed the food all together and dumped it, steaming, into the bowl. "Stranger things have happened. And besides I'm a great cook."</p>
<p>"Vegan, remember?" She brought the rice over to the table.</p>
<p>"I can manage vegetables. I grew up with you didn't I?"</p>
<p>The look she gave me was worth it.</p>
<p>( Day 1)</p>
<p>The headlights made the road before me seem to stretch out into infinity. Appearing from the darkness, never-ending pavement that vanished beneath us, only to reappear. Only the odd bit of rock, scrub brush, or sun-faded signage marking the miles changed the looped image.</p>
<p>Olivia was asleep beside me, her seat leaned way back. The occasional light snore rising above the sounds of the road.</p>
<p>With seven hours of driving behind me, I was feeling the miles weighing down my eyelids.</p>
<p>I was about to give in and pull over for a nap when ahead of me I saw a line of red lights beginning to build. Like a train of crimson stars, they snaked through the hills and valleys ahead of my half-circle of lights. In the distance, maybe a few miles further away, I saw the lights tightening up, then bend around a sharp turn. I had to slow as I closed on this snaky procession of breaking vehicles. The van was nearly at a rolling stop when I saw the signs for a turn-off appearing ahead.</p>
<p>"Are we there yet?" Olivia mumbled next to me, half awake.</p>
<p>I eased us to a stop ten feet behind a popup camper trailer, being towed by a Suburban. "Looks like we're getting close."</p>
<p>"What time is it?" She half turned in the seat.</p>
<p>I glanced at my phone on the console beside me. "About 2:30. Sorry, 3:30, I forgot about the time change."</p>
<p>My sister mumbled an acknowledgment. "Wake me when we get to the entrance." She turned away, snuggling deeper into her pillow against the window.</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>Moving at the speed of a rum-drunk sloth, we eased around the corner and left the paved road for compacted gravel and desert sands. The trailer lights ahead of me gave a small lurch and then we did the same. I heard some gear shift around in the van behind me. I looked in the side mirror and watched the trailer we were hauling pass the rut in the road easily. There were already two cars piling in behind us and another joining that growing line.</p>
<p>We topped a small hillock and rounded a curve. Ahead of me, I saw the line of red brake lights stretching off for miles.</p>
<p>With a sigh, I eased us forward a foot more. "I'm betting you get a good long rest, sis."</p>
<p>Her soft snore was my only answer.</p>
<p>Apparently, a zombie can drive a van. "Brains ... brains... ."</p>
<p>Five hours later, with slow surges of a few hundred feet at a time, we finally approached the multiple gates. The long line in front of me had become a widening flood of red lights till - a few hours back - dawn broke revealing the huge number of vehicles spreading out before us.</p>
<p>"Jesus," my sister whispered.</p>
<p>Glancing, over I saw that Olivia had finally awoken. How anyone could sleep through that many stops and starts and the sun blazing into the windshield is beyond me. But then, even as a kid, my sister could sleep through an airstrike.</p>
<p>"I wasn't expecting this," she mumbled. Turning, she stuffed the pillow behind her among our piled luggage. "This many cars! It's insane."</p>
<p>I shrugged. "Eighty thousand plus people takes a lot of transportation to move. This is really pretty impressive that they can manage this many people with any kind of organization. It could be chaos so easily."</p>
<p>Olivia pointed at the seemingly endless lines of cars in the dust. "This isn't chaos?"</p>
<p>Shaking my head, I eased us forward toward the tall flags another few feet. "No, not even close. I've seen chaos. This is simply crowded, dusty, and slow." I chuckled. "Toss in a few dozen camels and a couple of trucks filled full of refugees and I've seen this same thing on a dozen roads in Iraq."</p>
<p>Suddenly my sister sat up. "Hey, is that Jim's truck?"</p>
<p>Looking ahead to where she was pointing I saw a truck that at least looked kind of familiar. Before I could say anything Olivia threw open her door and went running ahead to say hello. With a sigh, I reached over and pulled her door back closed. It must have been them because she walked along beside the truck for a few feet as we moved forward again. Although we seemed to be moving in inches, those rows of flags seemed to advance much quicker now.</p>
<p>Gazing out over the cluster of over-packed cars spread out ten lanes wide, I remembered a similar sight. A column of refugees fleeing the madness that was an endless war. My eyes darted to the sides of the road with a hard-won reflex. I hunted and searched the sandy ground looking for disturbed places where an IED had been buried. It was several moments before I could make myself stop and then I was visibly trembling. I tightened my hands on the truck's steering wheel till my knuckles whitened.</p>
<p>The person appearing suddenly at my driver's side window about gave me a coronary!</p>
<p>She made a rolling down motion ... and, ironically, this van is old enough that you have to actually roll the window down by hand.</p>
<p>"Only one in the vehicle? Do you have your ticket?" she asked, pulling down a dusty mask enough for me to hear.</p>
<p>I fished our tickets out of the console next to me. "It's two. My sister ran up there to our friend's truck to say hi."</p>
<p>She looked ahead to where I was pointing, frowned, and then with a wave of her hand caught someone's attention and - using a few hand signals I recognized - directed him to Olivia. The man walked over to my sister quickly.</p>
<p>"Please stay in the vehicle unless directed to get out," she told me as she looked over my tickets but didn't take them. "Decal is in place, you get two brownie points for that and these look good. Hang on to them. Miss," she raised her voice as my sister was escorted back to the passenger side door. "... we do ask that you stay inside the vehicle till you get to the greeters. It's dusty out here, people can't see and they will run over you."</p>
<p>My sister huddled in on herself a bit, then pointed out the windshield at the guy walking away. "That's what he said. I'm sorry, I didn't know."</p>
<p>"Virgins. Great." She muttered with a mild hint of harassed disgust, then she looked back at me. "Please stay between the cones. If you run over my cones you will piss me off. Just up ahead your van and trailer will be searched. Then they will move you forward."</p>
<p>With a nod, she left us to go to the car behind us.</p>
<p>Sticking the tickets back where they had been, I rolled the window back up, looked over, and realized there was a film of dust over everything in the cab already.</p>
<p>"Wow." Olivia reached up and wrote her name in the dust on the dashboard in front of her.</p>
<p>"Yep, going to need to take a leaf blower to this thing next week just to get the dust out of everything. Been there done that before." I eased us forward. Ahead I could see that several vans, a couple of RVs and some tow-behind camping trailers had been opened up and people were rummaging around inside checking on things. The list of what not to bring - that I had so religiously insisted everyone who was going to camp with us follow to the letter - was suddenly going to become very important to the speed of our forward progress.</p>
<p>Not that our forward progress wasn't being measured in inches.</p>
<p>I'm sure it wasn't an hour later when I pulled up to the vehicle check, it just felt like it was. For me though, it wasn't the fact that a person I had never met was about to open up my van, and trailer and then search through everything that I had brought that got me suddenly excited.</p>
<p>It was the fact that a big truck moved and I saw the square phone booth shape of a port-a-let.</p>
<p>A guy in a black vest came up to my door. "Alright, we're going to have to take a quick look inside, if you don't mind. Even if you do mind for that matter. If you can open it up for us."</p>
<p>"Sure thing." Hopping out, I opened the twin panel-style back doors on this old cargo panel van, then walked around and threw open the latch arm for the trailer. "If my sister stays here to help you, do you mind if I walk over to that little tan box? My eyes are floating and I feel like I'm about to take a ten-two hundred."</p>
<p>The fellow chuckled. "By all means. We'll check your load while you go leave a load."</p>
<p>"Thanks. Olivia! I'll be right back."</p>
<p>She waved me on as she moved into the back and mostly got in their way by trying to find something in one of her pink Rubbermaids while they searched for the things we shouldn't have brought.</p>
<p>Trying to look like I was not doing a latrine sprint, while I sprinted for the latrine, was a very valuable skill I had learned in the military. It involves ridged disciple and a clenched spinster muscle you couldn't drive a steel pen into. And, when I got there, it was all of that I had come to expect from overly used public facilities, worldwide. Still, I had important paperwork that needed to be filed and beggars can't be choosers, as it where.</p>
<p>By the time I got back, they were closing up the trailer and Olivia was sitting in the passenger seat in a royal funk over something. As I walked up the guy I had first met closed the back of the van.</p>
<p>"Everything come out alright?" he asked with a grin. He shot a thumb towards the closed door. "Ex-military, am I right? I can always tell," he said at my nod. "You probably know to within an inch where everything inside there is stowed. If you get bored this week come see us here at the Gate. We can always use volunteers that are organized."</p>
<p>I gave a shrug and an answering grin. "I've got seven newbie campers to watch after for the next week. Bored I'm not sure I will have time to get. But, I'll keep it in mind."</p>
<p>He patted my shoulder and moved to the next dusty vehicle waiting for its search.</p>
<p>As I hopped back inside, I saw a lady in a similar black vest waving a set of flags gesturing for us to move ahead. What she was doing was more interpretive dance than semaphore, but I got her meaning and eased forward now following a line of small flags.</p>
<p>"I couldn't find my tiara."</p>
<p>Trying to keep an eye on the ill-defined road and look over at my sister, my gaze went to the top of her head. "Um..." I pointed with my chin.</p>
<p>My sister gave me a look "I mean my gold one!"</p>
<p>"Oh." Following flag girl's directions, I headed over towards a line of white sail-like canvas wedges with colored flags atop them. Cars were parked between them and people were getting out. I saw a dozen people being hugged and as I got closer I could hear bells ringing. "Um, you wrapped it into a blue scarf, if I remember right. Same box as you put the white dress and pink Tutu."</p>
<p>My sister gave me an odd look all the way till we pulled up between two of the white wedges.</p>
<p>"Yea! You're here! Get out, get out, get out!"</p>
<p>A man that would be perfectly at home in either a Mad Max movie or a stage show for the Rocky Horror Picture Show appeared at my door the moment the van stopped. On the other side, a woman in rainbow colors had already half-pulled Olivia from the passenger side and was more dancing with her than hugging her.</p>
<p>Climbing out, I couldn't help the smile that appeared on my face. This guy's energy was infectious.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am so glad you are here! Can I hug you?"</p>
<p>At my puzzled nod, he all but slammed into me. My first thought was that his need for a bath this early into the event could be an issue before the week was out. But then I did a mental adjustment back to the hot lands of years back and the smell wasn't even bad when compared to the funk of forty thousand years I had often encountered while over there. Nothing human on this pretty blue Earth beats the piss-encrusted rear end of a camel in rut for gagging stench.</p>
<p>"Welcome home!" He looked me up and down. "First time here? Are you a ... virgin?"</p>
<p>I was about to answer when my sister called out "Yes, he is!"</p>
<p>The guy made a naughty naughty gesture with his fingers. "Oh, I love virgins! We have to baptize you in the playa. You do know you're going to get dirty this week, right? Why not start now! Dust angels!"</p>
<p>Laughing at him, as much as anything, I followed him over to a place where the dust looked to have been disturbed a few hundred times. My sister was already there, down on the ground making an angel in the dust. When she flipped over onto her belly I saw that Olivia had dust all over her ass now.</p>
<p>"Lay down, lay down, and let the dust bring you home. The dust is magical!" Reaching down, he scooped up two handfuls and tossed them high making a miniature fog of dust drift off towards the center of the camp. "The very breath of life."</p>
<p>Humoring him, I laid down full length upon the warm dusty ground. I made a wide-armed angel then turned over. I breathed in the powdery dust.</p>
<p>My adrenaline spiked.</p>
<p>For a few scant seconds my heart raced, my hands clenched into fists, and I felt a long remembered and familiar panic flash through me! I had to convince myself that I was in a tank top and shorts rather than dusty tan BDUs. That my baseball cap wasn't my Kevlar cover. Then another sudden flash of terror that I didn't have my rifle had to be dealt with.</p>
<p>Pushing up, I hid what I was feeling. I went over and rang the bell. I watched my sister do the same. Saw the happy joy on her face as she screamed out "I'm a burner!"</p>
<p>I thanked the man as I took my map, hand booklet, and listened to his instructions about the speed limit in camp. All the while I hid what was within me at that moment.</p>
<p>Fear.</p>
<p>Fight or flight hovering right there on the edge.</p>
<p>Olivia was all but bouncing. "Oh, that was so much fun. I've got dust everywhere now!"</p>
<p>I heard her. I heard my sister and I didn't. My eyes were focused on a star-shaped scar on the back of my hand as I gripped the steering wheel.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>The smell of dust was so heavy in my nose. Chokingly heavy, so hard to breathe.</p>
<p>"John!"</p>
<p>Startled, I looked over at Olivia. For a half second, I didn't even recognize my sister. It was the look of worry on her face - so similar to our mother's look when she heard I was going to join up - which brought me back to where I was.</p>
<p>My sister reached over and placed her hand atop my hand. "Are you okay?"</p>
<p>Sucking it up, I nodded, put the van into gear, and moved out into the wide-open desert before me. I soon found myself following a small RV, but at least we were finally moving at a speed a tiny bit faster than a grandmother on her walker.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>Ignoring her concern, I changed the subject. "Look at the map and navigate us to where we're camping. I've got to keep my eyes out for stray naked hippies on bicycles."</p>
<p>"What is our area again?" she asked, unfolding the clock-shaped camp map.</p>
<p>I had to think for a second. "7:00 and H. The open camping area, right?"</p>
<p>She nodded. "Yeah, that's right. I wanted to camp closer, but Victoria said it would be better for us to not have to deal with camp registration for our first year. It sucks though, we will have to bike forever to get where the big parties are."</p>
<p>Looking over at a line of tall brown and blue cubes. "I'm more concerned with port-a-let placement. Too close is worse than too far." I saw a street sign pointing inwards towards the tall structure in the distance that must be The Man. "There is 7:00."</p>
<p>Taking the turn, I saw the RV head off around the long curved dusty road.</p>
<p>"There's Gloria's car!" Olivia all but jumped out of her seat. "That must be H."</p>
<p>I shrugged "Or maybe she's just parked in the middle of nowhere; a poor vegan, lost, starving in the dust."</p>
<p>Olivia reached over and popped my arm. "You will not spend the whole week teasing her about her being a vegetarian."</p>
<p>I dodged the blows. "Alright, I won't tease her ... all week. Maybe just on the days that end in the letter Y."</p>
<p>"John!"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay." Pulling in beside the dusty Toyota RAV4, I saw the tall redhead get out and come running around to the passenger side of the van. Olivia jumped out and the two ladies hugged like they hadn't seen each other just a week ago, or so. I had hardly shut off the van when Jim pulled his truck up beside us.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>Tim jumped out in hot pink shorts and a white fishnet tank top. He rushed over to the two girls and joined the group hug-in.</p>
<p>Like me, Jim got out much slower. The long drive in was beginning to take a toll. The knowledge that we had to set up my massive tent -- and knowing just how much work that took -- before I could lay down and catch a nap was depressing.</p>
<p>Jim walked up and held out an open bag of wet grapes to me. Taking one, they were super cold and the juice was almost intoxicatingly sweet.</p>
<p>"Linda and Bill called; they are one their way but won't be here any time soon. Kat called just before we lost cell coverage. She's in Reno, should be here tonight." Jim looked around at the flat patch of white playa. "So this is home for the next week. Well, I've lived in worse looking apartments for longer. So, what's first? The tent?"</p>
<p>Looking over at the sun hanging like an orange ball of death above the scorched mountains surrounding this place, I gave a nod. "And fairly quickly. The temperature is rising by the second and the sooner we get some shade set up the better." I looked over at the other three who had a 'let's go explore' vibe setting in. "Hey! Before we all head off in different directions, it takes about an hour to set up my tent, but a lot less than that when there are more people."</p>
<p>Tim struck a hip out pose. "Well, let's get er done' then stud muffin. I'm ready to get my party on and we are burning daylight."</p>
<p>"Speaking of which ..." Gloria took off her wide-brimmed hat wiping her forehead on the back of her hand. "It is really blistering out here, isn't it? How much hotter do you think it will get today?"</p>
<p>Leaving that unanswered, I walked around to the trailer and opened the door. Inside were the multiple rolls of ground tarps, colorful linen cloth inner walls, old oriental rugs, and the big camel and goat wool canvas jelly roll that was the tent itself lay -- more or less- neatly stacked. The long tent poles and the battered old green Rubbermaid with the brass finials, carpet and canvas squares, and the newly bought long screws - which I learned would be best to use as tent stakes in the hard desert playa -- were also all packed away inside.</p>
<p>Jim stepped around and looked inside. "Good lord. Is all of that just the tent?"</p>
<p>"Mostly, yep," I said, nodding. With a sigh, I began to drag stuff out. When he appeared beside me, I handed Tim the big gray roll that was the ground cloth. "Can you wrangle up my sister and Gloria to help you spread that out?"</p>
<p>He nodded. "Sure. Oh, ladies!"</p>
<p>Handing Jim the semi-heavy Rubbermaid, I took a deep breath and with a grunt-heaved lifted the big heavy roll of slightly fuzzy cloth up into my arms. With a deep breathy moan, I took slow carefully placed steps over to where the others were gathered. I saw that Tim and the ladies had unrolled and folded out the big gray tarp. I dropped the tent canvas atop one side. It landed with a heavy thud.</p>
<p>"Good lord, what does that weigh?" asked Gloria.</p>
<p>Leaning forward, hands on my knees, I took a deep breath feeling the small twinge pull in my back. "About two hundred pounds, but I swear it gets heavier every time I pick it up. Let's roll it out across the tarp."</p>
<p>With all of us working it didn't take long to get the fifty foot of cloth unrolled. Then, with me directing them, we folded one side out till it was nearly on the edge of the tarp. Opening the Rubbermaid, I took out a good handful of metal screws and dropped one of the foot-long metal bars by each of the steel grommets in the canvas. Waving away questions, I walked over to the van and came back a moment later with my impact drill.</p>
<p>Just like the videos had said they screwed right into the hard-packed dusty ground, securing the tent.</p>
<p>"Well, ain't that neat," said Gloria.</p>
<p>I handed her the drill. "You can do the other side. But first, I need help with the tent poles, so follow me. Everybody grab one and I'll show you where they go."</p>
<p>Behind me, Tim sang out. "Jim, did you hear that? This nice man wants me to grab hold of his pole for him. I knew this was going to be a fun week."</p>
<p>I stopped in mid-stride back to the trailer. It's going to be a long week.</p>
<p>Stepping up into the trailer, I handed out the heavy and ornately carved wooden tent poles.</p>
<p>Gloria took hers and paused to look over the carvings. "These are beautiful. What is the screw at the top for?"</p>
<p>I leaned the longest one on my shoulder. "Come and see."</p>
<p>I directed them to place the different length poles at the various places, pointing out the heavy-duty round grommets in the canvas at each. Kneeling down, I had them gather around while I demonstrated.</p>
<p>"Place a carpet square over the threaded end first. Then thread the pole through the metal grommet. Then a canvas square, then screw down the finials. Short poles along this line of holes. Longer poles go in the middle of the tent."</p>
<p>They each took a pole and we soon had the first row in place.</p>
<p>"Okay, lay it flat like this." I demonstrated what I meant. "Now, same thing for the longer poles."</p>
<p>Walking out onto the canvas, we repeated what we had just done.</p>
<p>"Alright, now the fun part." I picked up the longest pole, slid a carpet square onto it, and pointed to the largest of the brass finials. "That one, please."</p>
<p>Attaching it, with its double-thick canvas washer in place, I took a couple of deep breaths and then pushed up on the thick pole, raising the center of the heavy canvas off the ground.</p>
<p>"Hold this one for me now, please."</p>
<p>Jim and Tim rushed forward and help hold it in place. I turned it loose and ducked under the heavy canvas to raise the other poles behind us, tightening the canvas as each was lifted. When I ducked back out I saw that Gloria and Olivia were already working on getting the other four short poles in place. I moved over to help hold those in place.</p>
<p>"Gloria? Want to screw?"</p>
<p>She looked up startled, then - seeing the drill in my hand, held out towards her -- she grinned. "Always."</p>
<p>"Olivia, help her pull the canvas tight, then she can screw it down. Do each corner first." I gestured for Tim and Jim to come help. "Guys, that center pole will stay in place now. Help me lean these poles out to pull tension on the canvas."</p>
<p>As we held the shorter poles in place, Gloria and Olivia rushed around drilling the long screws deep into the playa. I could tell when she was done. I turned my tent pole loose.</p>
<p>"Well, there she is." I took a deep breath. "The rugs in the van cover the ground cloth. Those two darker canvas rolls are for the ends. We can roll those up to let air in. And the colorful cloth rolls attach here." I pointed to the line of ties across our canvas ceiling. "They make the inner walls. We can divide it up in a dozen different ways. We'll just have to see what works for us."</p>
<p>Olivia was turning around looking at the shaded space. "This is huge! You could place volleyball under here."</p>
<p>Jim walked over to the main tent pole and gave it a light push. It moved just a bit. "You don't have to anchor these down?"</p>
<p>I shrugged. "We can, I have bracings that do that, but the weight of the tent will keep them in place. Also, it's meant to move a bit with the wind."</p>
<p>Tim was slow spinning in a circle looking around as well. "You said it's fifty by fifty? That's twenty-five hundred square feet. Hell, my house isn't much more than that. I love it. Where did you get this thing?"</p>
<p>Having known that this question would be asked, perhaps many times, still didn't lessen the pain that flashed through me. "I was gifted it. It belonged to the dead brother of a man who I helped out. He was a city dweller, and he didn't need the tent. Just had it in storage. I mentioned to him that I spent a lot of my time camping out ... back home. He gave me it. Just drove up in a truck and dropped it off for me at the base camp." I looked at the open space remembering the last time I had stood under this canvas. "It was only the tent canvas. I made the poles and had a metal working guy I know to craft the bronze finials for me."</p>
<p>My sister looked around. "Um, is it just me or does it feel cooler?"</p>
<p>Tim gave her a look and then gently patted her shoulder. "We're in the shade, lovely."</p>
<p>Toting in one of the long rolls of oriental carpeting on my shoulder, I began to spread it out on the floor. "The tent drafts air." They all gave me an odd look. "The dark canvas gets hot, the heat rises and pulls air through the cloth which makes a cooling draft. The hotter it gets the better it works."</p>
<p>Tim gave his face a fan "We have an air-conditioned tent? Oh, lord we are blessed with this man."</p>
<p>He was the first one to hug me, but the others closed in and hugged me as well. It was a strange but, at the same time, rather familiar feeling. Other than my sister, these were strangers. But then so many times in my life I had been in similar situations. Living for a short time under a canvas roof with strangers that became closer to me than family. I had the feeling that, before this week was out, I was going to feel similar feelings towards these people.</p>
<p>Then Tim grabbed my ass.</p>
<p>Yep, it was going to be a long week.</p>
<p>We emptied the three vehicles into the tent quickly enough. Gloria and my sister worked together to place an inner wall to give them some privacy for changing into their 'outfits' before heading out into the festival to look at art projects and to find the other members of the art project we were to help with.</p>
<p>Jim worked on setting up the kitchen area by one of the outside walls. He began a small meal of grilled sandwiches while Tim and I basically hung partitions, organized, and decorated the inside of our camp.</p>
<p>Stepping back outside to my van for the half dozen folding chairs, I noticed that the ever-growing temperature rise was now a brutally palpable thing. I grabbed my wide-brimmed hat after the second trip.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>Turning, I found my scantily dressed little sister almost in my shadow. She was wearing what was basically a bikini top with yoga shorts and boots.</p>
<p>"Can you get my bike out for me?"</p>
<p>Looking over, I saw Gloria had on a similar outfit and was busy getting her bike down off the rack on the back of her car. My eyes took in the view of pale freckled skin. "Sure. Lunch will be ready soon though?"</p>
<p>Olivia nodded. "We'll grab it to go." Then she leaned in close to me and cut her eyes towards Gloria. "Like what you see? I wouldn't get your hopes up, big brother. She's not interested in dating."</p>
<p>Looking down at my sister, I smiled. "Never been terribly partial to redheads. Besides - between the two of you - you've got the better body; she's a bit thin for my tastes."</p>
<p>She gave me a smirky smile. "Um, hum. Well, just keep in mind that just because this is an Arabian tent does not mean you get to collect a harem this week. My bike? Please."</p>
<p>Going back to the trailer, I stepped inside and lifted her pink monstrosity of a bike from the hooks on the inner wall. A rolling monument to pink fluff and bright pink para-cord tassels it was instantly trying to snag on my bike, the hooks, other gear, and a half dozen other things before I could get it out of the door. I wheeled it over to her where she and Gloria stood eating their sandwiches. They waved goodbye and vanished off into the growing city of dusty tents and roving cars.</p>
<p>I took two of the sandwiches and grabbed a soda from the cooler.</p>
<p>Looking up, I saw Tim in a billowy white bathrobe, a turban hat, snowboard goggles, and enough bangle bracelets to deck out a dozen Vegas hookers come walking out of his side of the tent. He set a One Wheel board on the ground and vanished after my sister and Gloria.</p>
<p>Jim came over and sat near me with his food. "I don't know about those fools, but I'm exhausted. They want to go explore and party. I want to eat and pass out for a few hours."</p>
<p>I nodded in weary agreement. "Same."</p>
<p>He took a bite and chewed it slowly. "John, I have to ask. Do you have any problem with Tim and me? Being gay, I mean?"</p>
<p>Taking a sip, I cleared my mouth. "To be honest, I could care less. It never has been a major thing for me." I shrugged. "My time in the military ... well, it can make people go either way as far as caring about that. Me? I just have other things that I have to worry about than who is doing what with whom in bed."</p>
<p>He gave me a nod of agreement. "Tim ... well, lord knows he can be a bit much at times. He was a little worried is all. Wanted me to ask."</p>
<p>"Well, tell him I'm fine with it." I smiled. "And if he was concerned he could have asked before he grabbed my ass."</p>
<p>We both laughed.</p>
<p>After a bit, Jim finished his food and, with a yawn and a mumbled goodbye, vanished behind a curtain wall off into his side of the tent.</p>
<p>Sitting there, alone at last, I looked out the end of the tent to the seemingly endless line of new cars, trucks, vans, and RV filtering in. The knowledge that there could be as many as seventy to eighty thousand people pouring in here over the next few days and the logistic nightmare that it must be taking to deal with that was staggering.</p>
<p>Then a topless woman stopped before the open side of the tent. She stood there looking around inside for a moment, saw me, and smiled. "I love your tent. This is awesome!"</p>
<p>I had to grin. "Thank you."</p>
<p>She waved and vanished as quickly as she had appeared.</p>
<p>Well, maybe a walkabout would be nice before my nap.</p>
<p>Going to the area I had walled off for me to sleep, I opened my trunk and dug out a change of clothes. Light billowy black pants, a beaded vest, and a tan and black patterned shemagh scarf. Placing a wide heavily decorated belt around my waist, I hooked my goggles with my drinking cup on my belt carabiner just in case.</p>
<p>Stepping outside, I went to the van and pulled out my favorite of the carved, burned, stained, and sandblasted walking sticks that I had made over the last few years. It was starting to get polished smooth in places from my handling it. Turning to walk towards the center of the growing city, I paused, backtracked to the van, and grabbed my cigar case off the visor, just in case I wanted a bit of smoke.</p>
<p>The sun on the white playa dust was as blinding as snow, and the billowing dust was thick as fog behind the many moving vehicles.</p>
<p>Ready to face this desert world, so similar to one I once knew, I ambled off into the growing chaos that is Burning Man.</p>
<p>I've never considered myself an artist. A craftsman, maybe, since I've always liked working with my hands. When I was stationed in the mountains in Afghanistan I would often pass the time carving walking sticks, mostly just to help not go mad with either anxiety or boredom between the firefights. I made dozens of them in the months over there. I know most of what I made must now be in the hands of local villagers. The elders all moved over the hilly terrain with the help of such canes, and mine got remarked on all the time. I gave away most of them as gifts.</p>
<p>Walking here I saw what people who I would call artists can really do. The creativity, the sheer scale of some of what they had built - and were still in the process of building - was simply incredible. Wooden frameworks that towered into the skies. Huge faces made of simple lumber that seemed to scream so lifelike at the people walking past.</p>
<p>And so much of what I saw moved! It wasn't a simple static structure, but lifted and turned, and dipped in so many odd ways. It was like walking through a museum but with the art in motion.</p>
<p>Passing a structure that I couldn't have even begun to think of how it was built, I stood and listened to the sound of the wind passing over the hundreds of pipes. A series of strings vibrated as the pipes hummed. Great streets of metal trembled adding base notes. There were bells, like immense wind chimes.</p>
<p>And somehow it was all tuned to play the same harmonious tune.</p>
<p>The sound of a distant propane torch igniting drew my attention away from that musical sculpture after I don't know how long of me simply standing there looking and listening. Walking over in that direction, I smiled when I saw two men working on an art project doing something that I at least knew how to do.</p>
<p>The older of the two - maybe a half-decade younger than my own early thirties -- was dressed in a gray tank top and a faded blue denim kilt- was adjusting the flame length on the bottle torch he held.</p>
<p>"So we just burn the surface and then brush off the char?" asked the younger guy. He was shorter, a dishwater blond, maybe five-six or so, with ragged jean cutoffs and no shirt. His back was covered in blue ink Celtic tattooing. "And that makes it look like this?"</p>
<p>As I walked up I saw that he held a book on Shou-sugi-ban.</p>
<p>The older guy nodded, finally getting the torch to his liking. "Yeah, pretty much. I'm not sure for just how long we burn it. Guess we'll just have to try it and see."</p>
<p>I had to speak up. "Depends on what finish you're looking for."</p>
<p>They both turned to me and after a quick look, smiled.</p>
<p>The older guy held the burning bottle torch out toward me. "Do you know how to do this? We're pretty much making it up as we go along. I'm Derick, by the way."</p>
<p>"Steve," the other one chimed in.</p>
<p>"John." I looked over what they were working on. A huge wooden shrimp or perhaps crayfish of some kind. "Yeah, I can show you how. It's mostly about patients and heat control. And, even if you mess it up, it still looks okay." Taking the offered torch, I leaned my walking stick against the folding table nearby. "Warm the wood to start with, soft passes with the fire."</p>
<p>"May I?"</p>
<p>I glanced over at Steve. He was pointing at my walking stick. "Sure."</p>
<p>As I gently torched the wood to an even warmth, Derick watching my every step, I could see Steve turning the walking stick in his hands. Often pulling it closer to look over the different details.</p>
<p>"Now that it's warm, we start to burn. Slow passes from side to side. I like to go top to bottom, but bottom-up works just as well," I said.</p>
<p>"Dude, this thing is sick looking." Steve tapped Derick's elbow and passed him my walking stick. "How did you do this section here?"</p>
<p>Glancing over, I saw what had his attention. "Plumber's tape and a sandblaster. The tape gives that crisp edge, then the sandblaster cuts the soft wood away down to the harder grain."</p>
<p>"Wow. Can we do something like that with this prawn?" Derick handed it back to Steve.</p>
<p>A prawn? Okay.</p>
<p>Torching wood, I chuckled as I answered. "If we had a sandblaster setup here to use, sure. Otherwise, not so easily." Lifting the torch, I pointed out the zebra-stripped pattern now on the curved board. "Okay, now see how the harder 'fall wood' didn't burn? When we go back in now we burn it heavier and blacken everything that woods what we are trying to darken this time. The softer wood is going to burn away."</p>
<p>With them now both watching, I torched the wood to a blackened charred surface. Looking it over, I shut off the torch.</p>
<p>"Take your brush and scrub out the ash. You can lightly sand it smooth then, when you have the whole thing done, apply whatever top coat finish you like." I set the propane bottle to the side to let the tip cool. Taking back my walking stick, I leaned on it with both hands. "I'd recommend several coats of oil and wax, but varnish or polyurethane works just about as well. Out in this dust ... well, anything that dries quickly will be best, or you will have a white shrimp."</p>
<p>"Thank you, so much. Here. You will need this, trust me." Derrick reach into a pouch on his belt and handed me a still-wrapped tube of SPF lip balm.</p>
<p>I took it ... just because. "Thanks." I gestured out across the growing city. "Um, which direction do you suggest I go? I'm trying to see as much as I can here early."</p>
<p>They looked at each other then both shrugged.</p>
<p>Steve spoke up first."Have you seen The Man yet?"</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"How about The Temple?" suggested Derrick. "They are both that way."</p>
<p>Given that he pointed in the general direction I had been walking when I got distracted by the sound of their torch, I was happy enough with this advice. "Thanks, again."</p>
<p>"No problem at all. You're in the big Bedouin tent, that just got set up this morning, right?" He pointed in the general direction of my camp. "Dude, that thing is awesome."</p>
<p>Realizing they thought it was an art project, not authentic, I smiled, nodded, and simply said. "Thanks."</p>
<p>Taking off in the direction they pointed, I soon found myself walking along with a crowd of people all seemingly headed in the same direction. The sheer variety of costumes was fun. The lack of cloth in a few places was fun too. That was when I took notice of something. I've walked in far bigger clusters of people before. In big cities, certainly in the military during parade, but this was so strange it caught my eye and struck me as profound.</p>
<p>It was a crowd of individuals.</p>
<p>No gathering of suits or uniforms to enforce a similarity upon them. Each person was as different from the ones around them as was humanly possible to be.</p>
<p>Over the heads of the crowd, I began to notice a tall structure appearing. As I got closer I saw it was a wooden man, his arms out at his sides. He was built atop a wooden structure to raise him higher, but I couldn't make it out too well due to the people gathering in front of me. With a hint of irritation, I headed off to the left, cutting a flanking maneuver on this mobile circus of insanity. I was nearly even with "The Man" when things began to thin out.</p>
<p>Looking past him, I saw the empty desert and in the distance a much larger structure. It drew my attention far more than this wooden figure did. With a need-to-know building within me, I took off hiking in that direction, but I quickly saw that the distance however was a bit deceptive. I paused at the edge of the circle of people gathering behind The Man figure and stood there watching the steady stream of bicycles heading out onto the playa.</p>
<p>I was about to turn around and head back to my tent when a large black hearse - with the top removed and the back filled with bench seats, and a bronze head for a hood ornament - pulled up next to me. I recognized it as an attempt at the "Death Mobile" from Animal House.</p>
<p>A large man in a pirate costume popped up. "Need a ride out to the Temple?" He gestured dramatically to the back seat with a cardboard and silver tape cutlass. "Plenty of room, pile in."</p>
<p>Sure, why not.</p>
<p>"Thanks." Stepping over the cut-down side, I was almost settled into the seat when into the car piled a half dozen women all wearing a mixture of black vinyl, fuzzy pink bikini tops, gold chains, and silver top hats. They all but buried me under them in a mad, half-naked, laughing rush.</p>
<p>"Ladies, ladies, plenty of room to go around." The Pirate looked over at the driver - a handlebar mustached man in a WWII helmet of course - twirled the fake sword over his head and shouted "Let's take the cheese!"</p>
<p>The girls all shrieked as a steam whistle sounded loud enough to hurt. We were then all thrown back into the seat a bit.</p>
<p>Somehow as we crossed the playa I acquired a beer - not my brand at all, but it was cold - and a girl wearing mostly leather straps all but magically appeared on my lap. She draped herself across me, took off my hat and placed it atop her pretty head, and smiled at me.</p>
<p>"You're cute." She snuggled into me a bit. The alcohol fumes seemed to all but flow off her in waves. "It gets so cold here at night. Want to be my playa friend for tonight? I need someone to keep me warm."</p>
<p>"Sally! You're a lesbian." One of the ladies reached over and tapped her bare shoulder. "That's a guy!"</p>
<p>The woman in my lap looked back at me and took a moment to make her eyes focus. "You're a guy?"</p>
<p>I nodded. "Last time I checked."</p>
<p>She pouted. "Well, damn. I don't do guys."</p>
<p>"Well, that's good. Neither do I." I grinned at the girl sitting across from her, who was also looking me over. "But, if I'm not going to be your boyfriend, I am gonna need my hat back."</p>
<p>Sally squirmed on my lap a bit. "But this is such a nice hat." As the Death Mobile lurched to a stop, she caught hold of me. "Are you really sure you're a guy?"</p>
<p>"Afraid so."</p>
<p>With a pout, she put my hat back on my head and, as the girls poured out of the car, they took her along. The one who had been across from me stopped, looked me over, and then grinned at me. "I'm not a lesbian. Find me before the week is out."</p>
<p>Laughing softly, I tipped my hat to her cowboy style.</p>
<p>Standing up, I massaged my hip a bit. The old ache. Taking up my walking stick, I made my way out of the car, thanked the driver, and then followed the girls toward the huge wooden structure.</p>
<p>The Temple.</p>
<p>As I stepped inside I felt an almost chill wash over me. There was a silence here. Not that there wasn't sound, but it was all muted. As if to speak in more than a whisper was to break some unspoken rule. And then, as I walked deeper into that silence, my eyes began to take in the many pictures.</p>
<p>The knowledge that I had walked into a giant memorial settled into my bones like the touch of icy fingers.</p>
<p>Turning, I saw hundreds of faces staring out from photos and paper clippings. Scrawled on the wood next to so many of them were words of love, longing, loss, and heartbreak. There were people gathered in small groups, often sitting together on the dusty ground. I saw many a tear run heedless down faces stricken with grief. Cutting winding river trails through a chalky makeup of dusty skin, their tears often ran unchecked. Suddenly it felt like there wasn't enough air for me to breathe.</p>
<p>I turned to leave only to find a man standing directly behind me. Our eyes took in each other's faces, hunting, searching for the signs only men like ourselves ... that had seen the things we had seen ... would always carry. I saw without seeing that he was former military and at least a decade older than me.</p>
<p>"Battle of Fallujah, first and second," he said.</p>
<p>He made the simple statement with zero emotion in his voice. But it was that very lack of anything that spoke so incredibly loudly in my heart. I gave a small nod, acknowledging that I knew where he had been. What he had seen.</p>
<p>I had to take a slow deep breath before I spoke. "Korengal Valley. Four months."</p>
<p>I saw him flinch. A sympathetic wince at the pain I had suffered.</p>
<p>Before I could make any action he stepped forward and hugged me to him. Then, without another word spoken, he placed an odd-shaped token in my hand, folded my fingers around it, and all but vanished back into the Temple. Merging into the growing crowd come to ... worship?</p>
<p>Morn?</p>
<p>Looking down, I realized I held a little brass version of The Man in my palm. He had been made from a brass bullet casing, hammered flat and shaped with a grinder ... from what I could tell. It had a leather lanyard. Too short for a necklace, but perfect for a bracelet. Looking across the playa to the tall wooden figure in the distance, I absently slipped this charm over my wrist and, with my mind full of old thoughts, started back across the desert toward my camp.</p>
<p>I badly needed that nap ... but I also knew sleep was going to be hard to come by.</p>
<p>Step by step I crossed the open playa. As alone as I had ever been, even when I was surrounded by so many people.</p>
<p>I awoke from my nap in a rush that sent me flipping off of the thick foam mattress and onto the oriental rug. Huffing in playa dust, I groped for my service rifle, then - hearing the shell about to land close - I curled up against the rug my hands covering my head. Gasping, I counted the half-seconds I had left in my life.</p>
<p>The loud roar of the exploding ripped open the sky, shook the heavens, and a second later an almighty roar leaped up to meet the titanic sound.</p>
<p>Cheering?</p>
<p>Slowly uncurling, I stayed hunkered down on the floor and looked out into the tent. It was thankfully empty of my fellow campers. I was about to push myself to my feet when I heard another shell scream into the sky.</p>
<p>Looking out the open partition and through the rolled-up side of the tent, I saw a bright pattern of colored light blaze its way across the windshield of my van and Gloria's car. Shaking, I managed to pull myself up till I was half laying across the wrinkled, sweat-soaked sheets on my bed. I stayed there for far too long listening to the sounds of celebration so perfectly mimic the sounds of war.</p>
<p>"Just fireworks, John. Just fireworks." Rocking a bit, I gave myself a tight hug.</p>
<p>My sister's voice cut through the panic but then added additional layers."Are you okay? Did you fall out of bed?"</p>
<p>I couldn't will myself to answer.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>My fists tightened, white-knuckled in the damn sheets. "I'm, alright. Just leave me be. I'll be fine in a minute."</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>I could hear her getting closer. "Please... just leave... Olivia."</p>
<p>A huge double explosion shook the very air around us. I couldn't help the cry of panic that left me. My teeth gritted together, and I all but snarled at my sister as she stepped too close to me. Olivia pulled back but then eased herself past me, and sat down on the bed before me.</p>
<p>"John? It's just me. Just me."</p>
<p>A rapid series of pops sounded so much like gunfire I had to physically restrain myself from diving back to the floor. When her hand came to rest on mine my eyes popped open and I looked a hole into her face from two feet away.</p>
<p>"Please... ," I begged. "leave ... ."</p>
<p>Olivia's fingers curled around mine. "I'm not leaving you like this. I'll just sit here and hold your hand."</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure just how long the fireworks display outside lasted. Probably not more than a few more minutes, but to me it was the midnight mortar barrage coming in over the Hesco sand barriers to land among us. To send friends screaming for cover. To make the dark of night bright as day with the flares they used to show their snipers where we were.</p>
<p>Slowly, without me being really aware of her doing it, Olivia had moved herself around till she was sitting in front of me, and I was all but laying across her lap, my face resting against her bare thigh. Her arms hugged me tight and she held me, much like our mother would have.</p>
<p>Blessedly, the overhead display finally ended. Music, hard pounding music filled the night. Oddly enough it was such a familiar thing as bass-heavy techno music that began to bring me back to a sense of calm. That and the soft contact with Olivia's skin. It was also around that time that I began to take real notice of just what my sister was wearing. How little there was to it, and just how awkward close a position my face was in.</p>
<p>Minimal silver cloth bikini, with a fuzzy fur coat that looked like someone had fleeced a pink sheep. Looking up, I saw a silvery tiara atop her head. Her eyes looked at me softly.</p>
<p>"Feeling better?" she asked.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Want to talk about it?" She squeezed my hand.</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>She sighed. "I came back here to get my cup and a folding chair. I found a bar - not far from here - and I was going to sit there and listen to music and just hang out with people. Come with me. They have the beer you drink, it's free, and no one will bother you. I promise. They're good people." She got to her feet and, leaning over, put her hands under my arms. "Come on. I'm not going to take no for an answer."</p>
<p>Judging that I was either going to be dragged kicking and screaming to this bar or give in and walk there with a bit of my shredded dignity still intact. I allowed her to help me up.</p>
<p>Her arms came around me in a fierce tight hug.</p>
<p>"I love you, brother. I wish you would talk to me, but I ... kind of ... understand that you can't. But ..." She looked up into my face, her eyes glittering. " ... I'm here for you either way, big brother."</p>
<p>Smiling, I hugged her back. "I never could say no to a half-naked woman in pink fur."</p>
<p>Olivia grinned and looked down at the display of cleavage she was showing. "Oh, so that is your weakness, huh? Well, I will keep that in mind." Reaching out, she took my hand and tugged at it. "Come on."</p>
<p>"Free beer, huh?" Reaching out my free hand, I scooped up my hat and stuck it on my head.</p>
<p>She smiled. "Everything here is free, remember? Well, at Central Camp they sell coffee and ice, but other than that pretty much everything."</p>
<p>Outside there was a smell that almost stopped me in my tracks, and would have if she hadn't been dragging me along. I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't even have noticed the burnt cordite smell from the fireworks. As I stumbled along after her, memories floated before me like visions rising up from within the fog of time. That smell hanging all around us as the machine gun barrels heat pinged. The too-high laughter of men just happy to be alive. Happy to know the enemy they never saw was now dead.</p>
<p>Then the silence as we discovered bullet holes through our clothes. As minor shrapnel hits began to sting from the sweat pouring off us in the humidity-thick air.</p>
<p>We all developed the habit of checking ourselves after a firefight. And then checking out our buddies beside us.</p>
<p>That habit drew my eyes over Olivia.</p>
<p>My sister walked a bit ahead of me, tugging me along by my hand like she did back when we were little kids at Chuck E. Cheese. She was far from that little girl with pigtails and braces. Olivia was a woman well grown into her curves and this outfit - little more than a few panels of silver fabric and string - show that to a tee. As her pink fur robe thing opened up and I caught a flash of her hip and ass, I felt almost uncomfortable that here I was checking her out. But then I could hardly be blamed. She was truly stunning. And it wasn't just the way her clothes fit her. It was the flash of her smile, the quickness to laugh, the way her brown braided hair flipped around like a ropy banner. There was still an innocent beauty to my sister that any man would have happily signed away his earthly soul to bring closer into his life.</p>
<p>I tightened my fingers in hers and brought her to a halt. She looked at me puzzled.</p>
<p>"Thank you," I said, after a moment of staring at her.</p>
<p>"For what?"</p>
<p>Hesitantly, I stepped closer to her. "Not leaving, when I asked you to."</p>
<p>Olivia smiled that beautiful smile, then she was in my arms again giving me a tight hug. "Never leaving you, big brother. Not even when I find you crying your eyes out like a little kid."</p>
<p>"I was not crying."</p>
<p>She poked me in the ribs. "Yes, you were. Boo hoo hoo."</p>
<p>My eyes narrowed. With the speed of my military training my hands shot from around her back, under that fluffy robe, and found the exact spot along her rib cage where I know my sister to be the most ticklish.</p>
<p>"Eek!" Olivia squirmed trying to get away. "No! No tickling! No! Stop it! Eek!"</p>
<p>Then she was free of my hands and I was chasing after her. My sister darted around a tent, then tried to do a double back, knowing I was faster than her. I caught her and pulled Olivia to me, my teasing fingers hunting all down her side.</p>
<p>"Quit it!"</p>
<p>My hand caught the cloth of her bikini top, she tugged sideways, and my hand was under it before I could stop the motion. My sister gave a mild shriek as my thumb found its way into the humid warmth under her breast.</p>
<p>"Not the boobs!"</p>
<p>Giggling, I slipped my hand free, pulled her to me, and threw my arm around her shoulder, tucking her into my side "Come on sis. Take me to this bar before we have an accident and something naughty happens."</p>
<p>Olivia gave me a look and poked a finger into my ribs. "I just got felt up and you think something naughty 'might' happen!"</p>
<p>"Nah, that wasn't a felt up. That was the accidental placement of a thumb." I looked down at her. "In the event of an actual felt up my whole hand would have been involved and there might be a need for therapy afterward."</p>
<p>"Being felt up by my brother would certainly qualify as a - 'in need of therapy' -- moment in my life." She bumped my hip with hers. "Who knows, it could have led to dancing."</p>
<p>We were close enough to this bar that the music was reaching us. With a smile, I took her hand and turned to face her. "I used to like dancing. I've been known to do a pretty mean Two Step, I know The Git Up, and I can old school line dance with the best of them."</p>
<p>I tipped my hat and then my boots shuffled in the dust a bit.</p>
<p>My sister gave me a roll of her eyes and walked off to the bar in a huff. As she walked in, I heard people call her name in greeting. A large bearded man who looked like Blackbeard the Pirate hugged my sister like he had known her for years.</p>
<p>She pointed at me. "Robert, this is my brother John. For the love of all that is holy, can you please get him a beer? He drinks that stuff that looks like shoe polish."</p>
<p>He looked over at me and a bright smile appeared in that forest of a beard. "Guinness?"</p>
<p>I grinned back nodding. "Absolutely."</p>
<p>He ... Robert? ... gave a happy roar and, turning my sister loose, dashed to the bar. I looked in amazement as he took down a harp glass from a shelf, put it under what looked like a genuine Guinness tap, and began the pour. I smiled when he stopped it at the perfect level and sat it to the side. Reaching back he picked up a second glass that already had a line of foam.</p>
<p>"I can't let a brother of the dark hops drink alone, now can I?" With a grin at me, he worked to fill this one. "John, did she say?"</p>
<p>Looking over my sister was standing talking to a group of women dressed in yellow caution tape and blue LED lights. One of them took off a string of lights from around her arm and draped it over Olivia's neck.</p>
<p>When I looked back, Robert was looking at me expectantly.</p>
<p>"Sorry. Yeah. John Quigley."</p>
<p>Robert the Pirate waved that away and picked up my glass topping it off. "Last names are about as useful out here as a condom machine in the Vatican. Here you go, John." He held out a hand stopping me from drinking till he filled his own glass. He lifted it high. "Here's to cheating, stealing, fighting, and drinking. If you cheat, may you cheat Death. If you steal, may you steal a woman's heart. If you fight, may you fight for a brother. And if you drink, may you drink with me."</p>
<p>Grinning, I lifted my glass. "Slainte!"</p>
<p>My mouth flooded with that cold familiar taste. Bitter, roasted, chocolaty, and strong it flowed across my tongue. Normally, I would have taken no more than a long sip through the foam, but Robert's eyes over the edge of his glass were challenging me and I kept drinking till, like his, my glass was empty.</p>
<p>With a laugh, he reached for my glass to refill it again.</p>
<p>"Kat!"</p>
<p>Hearing my sister's voice call out behind me, I turned to see her throw open her arms and hug a rather plump woman who returned that hug so fiercely that she all but tumbled them both into the women behind. With much laughter, the two ladies were caught and steadied as they hugged.</p>
<p>So ... then we were six.</p>
<p>My sister hooked her arm and all but dragged the woman over to where I was standing. "Kat, this is my brother John. We're hoping that, between the two of you, you can keep the rest of us from dying this week."</p>
<p>The lady looked at me, did a slight double take, her eyes narrowing, and then shrugged and moved to hug me.</p>
<p>I took a step back.</p>
<p>I'm sure the look on my sister's face would have been something to see, but I missed out on it. My eyes were boring holes into our newest camp mate's face. I had made the connection almost instantly but it took her a second or two longer. Then her mouth dropped open in a perfect 'O' of surprise.</p>
<p>"Quigley!" She had that same quirky smile. "Oh, my god, I didn't even think about Olivia's last name when she said her brother was named John." She threw open her arms to hug me. "John Quigley! How have you been?"</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>I stepped back another step, and took slow deep breaths to hold back the demons. "Nurse Gillian. Been a while, hasn't it."</p>
<p>Her expression fell, but then she gave a slow understanding nod, biting her bottom lip she offered. "I can find another place to sleep for the week, if you like, John. Trust me, I do understand."</p>
<p>Olivia stepped forward at that.</p>
<p>"What is this? Of course, you're not going to be sleeping anywhere else, Kat! John?" My sister looked at me, seeing the hard look on my face, her brows furled. "I take it the two of you know each other, somehow?"</p>
<p>I gave a slow nod, then looked at the salt-and-pepper-haired woman who was watching me a bit apprehensively. "You're more than welcome to camp with us, Nurse Gillian."</p>
<p>"I will. But ... please, can you at least call me Katherine."</p>
<p>Turning, I handed the empty glass to Robert the Pirate, waved off the offer of a refill, then looked back at first Olivia, and then at ... Katherine. "I'll do my best to remember that. My sister can show you where the tent is. If the two of you will excuse me, I need to go for a walk."</p>
<p>I managed about ten steps before my sister caught up to me.</p>
<p>"Wait!"</p>
<p>Glancing down, my jaw locked tight on the building anxiety boiling within me. My sister took one look at my face, blanched a bit, then took the string of battery-powered LED lights from around her neck and draped them over my shoulder.</p>
<p>She patted them into place, then looked down at my feet."You can't be walking around after dark without lights. You will get run over by the art cars, or by bicycles."</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>It would not be too much of a lie to say that I fled into the darkness hoping it would carry me away from everything.</p>
<p>Just how far I walked I'm not sure - no, to be exact I'm entirely too sure since I know I counted every step I took in some small part of my brain - but I rejected that knowledge. I wanted to get lost.</p>
<p>But even that was denied me.</p>
<p>Before me, running off in each direction as far as the eye could see in the deepening dusk was an orange plastic fence. It was made of the type of netting they use on construction sites. There were strands of rope hanging from it and - looking to my right - I could see the square of a white sign.</p>
<p>Walking over to it, I read "The MOOP stops here."</p>
<p>With little grace, I sat down in the dust. "That must be what I am then," I said to the fence. "MOOP. Little more than wind-blown trash."</p>
<p>Staring back over my shoulder, I watched the thousands of lights that now made up Black Rock City as they appeared. Even this far out the thump of techno base could be heard like a distant thunder on the horizon. As if this improvised town was a storm brewing. Looking over, I could see the road into the city as a long line of headlights.</p>
<p>Wanting to ignore all of humanity, I laid back on the hard-packed dust and looked up at the sky. A million times a million stars hung there. And more appeared ever second as it got darker. The Milky Way was soon a blazing river of light crossing the sky. I half imagined that it must be looking down upon us poor creatures as we looked up at it.</p>
<p>The sound of a motor growing closer interrupted my tangled thoughts. Looking to the side, I saw a quad runner coming towards me. With a sigh, I sat up.</p>
<p>The man on the four-wheeler pulled up not far from me, and shut off the engine. "Lost?"</p>
<p>Blinking at the light ghosts floating before me from his headlight, I shook my head. "Only willingly."</p>
<p>Stepping off, he walked over and squatted down next to me. I saw the word Ranger on a vest he wore.</p>
<p>"I saw your lights here by the fence, so I came over to check. We get a few wandering souls every year that can't find their way home. And even more that are trying to sneak in." He looked looked over my pass, the back at the many lights and the music both blaring out into the darkness. "If you are sure you are okay, I'll leave you to it. But, I do need you to promise me you won't cross the fence."</p>
<p>Sitting up, I took off my hat and slicked back my hair. "Wasn't planning on it. Just needed some time alone."</p>
<p>He gave a nod, pulled his vest closer around him, and stood back up. "I can certainly understand that. It's been one hell of an opening day, so far. Try not to fall asleep out here though. The sand flees will eat you alive."</p>
<p>I watched him ride away down the fence line, then laid back on the playa.</p>
<p>"Sand fleas, huh? Been there and done that." Looking up at the stars, I grinned remembering a prank I once pulled on an Army buddy of mine with a camel spider.</p>
<p>But suddenly even that funny memory of those big bastards made me get to my feet.</p>
<p>The chill of the desert night was descending quickly, so I walked along the fence to keep warm. My mind in distant places, different times, lost spaces claimed by shadows and depression long ago. Sometimes it almost seemed like old friends long gone now walked there beside me in the night. They felt so alive to me at that moment. I could picture each and every one of them ... not as I saw them last ... but in the many months before those last and terrible moments.</p>
<p>Hunger, the growing cold, and a bone-deep weariness finally turned my feet towards the many lights of Black Rock City.</p>
<p>The place was really jumping now. Walking through the happy crowds, I passed among them like a dusty ghost out of the darkness. A few called out to me, but their words were like the murmurings of distant waters; turbulent rivers of emotion flowing across time-smoothed rocks. They couldn't reach me in my current state of mind.</p>
<p>When I finally reached my camp, I was both delighted and saddened to find the tent empty of our fellows. Stepping inside the dark Bedouin, I went to the tank that fed the hanging propane lanterns, turned the valve, and lit two of them. Their golden-white glow illuminated the inside to a dim impersonation of daylight. I could see where others had been here before me, dropping off gear and supplies.</p>
<p>Nurse Gillian, no doubt.</p>
<p>I paused.</p>
<p>Katherine. Her name is Katherine. Stop being an ass, John.</p>
<p>It was a long time ago, and she was just doing her job. It hadn't been personal for her ... no matter how personal it had been for you.</p>
<p>Moving over to the kitchen area, I absently fixed myself a sandwich, grabbed an apple juice, and mostly flopped into my chair by the curtain to where I slept.</p>
<p>"And let there be light."</p>
<p>Looking up, I had to smile seeing Tim dressed in a pink and white catsuit with a pink top hat perched atop his head.</p>
<p>He grinned at me. "I had to come back for my coat. I've been freezing my butt off for the last hour; no matter how much I'm dancing."</p>
<p>As he walked past me into his sectioned-off part of the tent I saw that the cat suit was ass-less. Shaking my head, silently chuckling, I had to hide my amusement when he emerged in a full-length zebra-patterned trench coat and rhinestone goggles</p>
<p>Tim struck a pose, then threw open the coat flashing me the catsuit. "Dramatic enough?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely," I said, leaning back in my chair.</p>
<p>"Well, that's a relief. I'm off to conquer hearts and seduce me some male buh-ta-hay." He tilted down his sparkly goggles and flashed me a smile. "Unless I could find something closer to home ... Mr. Man-cake?"</p>
<p>I shook my head. "Sorry, Timbo, but I still only swing to hetero."</p>
<p>He shook his head sadly and closed his trench coat around himself. "Story of my life, I swear. All the good ones are either straight, married, or morally confused." He looked at my food selection. "There is a place about three streets over that is serving the very best Shawarma - on I swear genuine handmade pita bread. They lured Jim in and put him to work cooking. Go and get you some! It is delicious, I'm here to tell you." He blew me a kiss. "I'm off; don't wait up."</p>
<p>Watching him go, I looked back down at the half-eaten sandwich in my hand. The idea of getting up and going to go get a more robust meal seemed like it would be a good idea but, at the same time, the idea of interaction anymore with anyone at the moment was just too much to contemplate. That little conversation with Tim all but wore me out.</p>
<p>Finishing the last few bites of my sandwich, I got to my feet, stepped through into my curtained-off area, and began to strip off my dusty clothes. I had an empty duffle bag by my bed and I stuffed them all into it. Taking out a pack of wet wipes, I began to do a simple cleaning only to realize how absolutely filthy with dust I was. It was everywhere!</p>
<p>By the time I was at least clean enough to be willing to get into bed, I had used up any remaining energy that I possessed. Throwing back my covers, I laid myself down on the clean sheets and then bundled up as the chill of the night tried to get a hold of my naked self.</p>
<p>Shuffling my pillows, I was asleep before my eyes had even fully closed.</p>
<p>A kick to the side of my mattress woke me in a rush. Startled, I reached for a weapon I didn't have, and that lack shot a flood of adrenaline through me. Luckily my sister spoke before I was hurtling up off the mattress to grab the shadow hovering over me in the darkness.</p>
<p>"Hey, you. Wake up!"</p>
<p>Olivia kicked the bed again.</p>
<p>"I'm awake already, what do you want?"</p>
<p>Her foot toed my side. "Move over. I want to sit down."</p>
<p>With a sigh for my lost sleep, I humored her and did as requested. Glancing at my watch, I saw that it was about four in the morning; something that did not endear my sister to me at all just then.</p>
<p>Olivia dropped onto the mattress in a plop. Draped around her were the LED strands of lights I had seen her wearing earlier, but the batteries must be about dead. They gave off almost no light. Her face was lost in shadow.</p>
<p>She poked me. "What is with you? Huh? What is with you?"</p>
<p>Great ... she was drunk.</p>
<p>"Answer me!" Another poke.</p>
<p>I batted her hand aside. "What?"</p>
<p>"What is with you and Kat?" Olivia picked up one of my pillows and whacked me with it. "She is a damn nice person, who does a lot of great work, with a lot of really nice people, who are really bad off, and I want to know just what your problem with her is?"</p>
<p>Sitting up, I leaned over to where I had a small battery nightlight and turned it on. From by my bag I picked up the bottled soda I had been sipping on earlier. It wasn't cold, but it was wet at least.</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>Swishing soda around my mouth to clear out the dust, I took a deep breath through my nose. "It's nothing. Unimportant."</p>
<p>"Oh, hell no. Nope, nope, nope. You caused a hell of a scene at Robert's bar over ... nothing? I'm not buying that for even a second." She tried to hit me with the pillow again, but I took it away from her. "Fess up, or I will beat you silly." My sister snatched at another pillow.</p>
<p>I yanked that one away as well, all but pulling her over in the process.</p>
<p>Olivia started hunting for something else for her to hit me with.</p>
<p>I sighed and gave in a little. "She was a nurse. At a doctor's office. Treating me at a bad time in my life."</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>I placed the pillow back where it belonged. "Not your business."</p>
<p>"I'm your sister!"</p>
<p>Sitting up, I tucked the second pillow I was holding behind me, leaning against my footlocker trunk. "Still not your business."</p>
<p>"I want to know!"</p>
<p>"Get used to disappointment." I took another sip of the warm soda still trying to get the gritty dust feeling off my teeth.</p>
<p>Olivia was about to say something else -probably at an incredible level of volume - when a male voice came through the partition curtain. "Children! Adults, with pre-hangovers, are trying to sleep. Argue outside if you must, please."</p>
<p>I looked at Olivia and mouthed "Tim?"</p>
<p>She shook her head. "Jim."</p>
<p>We both said, in a loud whisper. "Sorry."</p>
<p>Olivia turned and lay down on the mattress. After a moment I laid down next to her, our faces just inches from each other in the darkness. When she breathed out her breath carried the smell of wine. And ...Shawarma?</p>
<p>"Why won't you talk to me? Why won't you tell me things?" My sister gave my chest a poke. "We're family, damn it. Family tells family what is happening. They don't keep secrets."</p>
<p>I scoffed. "Every family keeps secrets! Admittedly, most of them only come out at Thanksgiving when people have had too much to drink... ."</p>
<p>"John, you are a complete dick." With a huff, she flipped over on the mattress and then looked back at me. "A whole bag of dicks."</p>
<p>Laying there for a few moments - breathing in the smell of her hair - I asked myself the same question a dozen times. Each time the answer was the same question back at me ... "Why not tell her, John? Why not?"</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, more a sigh really, I lifted my hand and laid it upon Olivia's hip.</p>
<p>"Six months after I got back from Afghanistan I ... I... ah, was kind of in a bad way. I was out of the military. That had been my life for years and I suddenly felt ... adrift." I paused for a moment then decided to let her know this as well. "Mom and Dad covered for me but ... I had some trouble .. with the Law, with alcohol, with drugs. Nothing serious. A couple of DUI. A few fights. Stupid shit."</p>
<p>Olivia turned over to face me. "Why didn't they tell me?"</p>
<p>I shrugged, then remembered she couldn't see that in the near darkness. The small nightlight was hardly bright enough to let me even see her nose, after all. "Ashamed of me, I guess. I'm sure with Dad it was mostly that." I chuckled. "Mom ... well, she probably was just afraid of what the neighbors would think."</p>
<p>"That sounds like her." Olivia nodded. "Oh, I'm going to give her an earful as soon as I get somewhere with cellphone service. So, you met Kat ... in rehab? You were in rehab?"</p>
<p>I took a deep breath, half choking on second-hand Shawarma spices. "Yeah. Rehab and then I saw her again at ... PTSD therapy."</p>
<p>"You also went to therapy?" She gave me a much harder poke. "Oh, I am so mad at all of you now. You have all kept me in the dark for years."</p>
<p>There wasn't much I could say in the face of that. It was the truth. Telling her that it simply hadn't been something that had anything to do with her was not going to sit well with her.</p>
<p>"At the time, I wasn't in any kind of mental shape to override Mom and Dad when they told me they didn't want to tell you. At the time I was flipping between being pissed or being depressed. It took me a long time, even after I got out of rehab before I could pick back up a beer and not be afraid I would drink the rest of the case." I absently lifted and played with a loose strand of her hair. "I still worry about that. So ... seeing Nurse Gil ... Kathrine when I was not expecting it. With me holding a beer. It kind of caught me off guard. Took me back to a bad time."</p>
<p>"And the fireworks earlier already had you on edge, right?"</p>
<p>I gave a soft chuckle. "That's putting it mildly, but yeah."</p>
<p>My sister was quiet for a moment. "And ...?"</p>
<p>I waited a moment. "And what?"</p>
<p>Now it was Tim's voice that called out into the darkness. "John, you darling man, would you please say you're sorry to your sister so that we can all get some sleep, already?"</p>
<p>My sister and I both had to giggle at that.</p>
<p>After a moment, I leaned my head forward till my forehead touched Olivia's. "I'm sorry. I really am.</p>
<p>I felt her smile, then she moved her head and kissed the tip of my nose. Then she spun herself over and snuggled back against me. "I'm sleeping here tonight. Your bed is warmer than mine."</p>
<p>Taking my blanket from behind me, I tossed it over her and me and fished one of the pillows I had been laying against around and gave it to her. Olivia tucked it under her head and then tried to snuggle closer into me. I got a sudden nose and mouthful of her hair and my chin was bumped hard by her skull.</p>
<p>"Oww!" She reached back and rubbed the back of her head. "Watch where you're putting that hard thing."</p>
<p>For all of two seconds the tent was quiet, and then ...</p>
<p>"What in the hell are you two doing over there?" Tim's high soprano cut through the distant thump of techno music. "Dear lord! Y'all can not be doing the naughty! I know this is a place to be free and explore, but you two are brother and sister for God's sake! That is not just right. At all."</p>
<p>"He hit me in the back of the head, Tim!"</p>
<p>Again there was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>There was a hint of awe in Tim's voice. "Well, I didn't hear you coughing over there, Miss 'O' so I guess... just how did you manage that? I always gag when one hits the back of my tongue."</p>
<p>"TIM!" Olivia sat up and screamed across the tent while I shook with laughter. "With his chin! He hit me with his chin."</p>
<p>I could hear Jim and Gloria now both laughing. I had to wonder where Katherine was or - if she was here - if she was just being quiet.</p>
<p>"Well, now that is just some kinky level shit beyond what even I'm comfortable with." Tim made a strange sound, like a snort giggle. "I was willing to give the two of you a pass on some incest, but weird chin sex? That's just a no! Now I've been known to use my chin a few times in some strange ways, but still--"</p>
<p>"Tim! We are not having sex!" Olivia's voice was probably was heard at The Man.</p>
<p>From one of the neighboring tents came a woman's voice. "We are!"</p>
<p>The entire Bedouin tent burst into laughter at that.</p>
<p>Slowly the tent went quiet around us. Olivia eased back down beside me, then gave a shiver. I shifted the blanket a bit and then pulled my sister in closer to my sheet-covered chest; spooning against the back of her for warmth. When my hand came to rest on her hip, she took my hand and pulled it around to her belly. The warmth of my sister's skin was as intoxicating as wine.</p>
<p>I absently kissed the back of her head. "Love you," I mumbled.</p>
<p>After a moment I heard her soft reply. "I love you, too."</p>
<p>(Day 2)</p>
<p>All the years of habitually forced early awakening aside, I'm not at all what could be called a morning person. If given my choice I will happily sleep in till ... oh, 6:30 ... before my eyes snap open and I vault from the bed as if it was about to electrify.</p>
<p>Given how late it was when I finally got back to sleep that I managed to sleep till 6:45 shouldn't be too much of a surprise. To awaken to a face full of soft hair under my nose and the warm warmth of a female body curled up against me was novel in its own right.</p>
<p>But, to be honest, I'm not truly "awake" till I've had my coffee.</p>
<p>Pulling the woman in my arms closer I buried my face in her hair, then let my hand roam across her belly. She purred awake, turned over, hugged me tight, and then turned her face up to mine. I leaned in and kissed her automatically. Her lips met mine softly, then with a flush of passion began a far more aggressive kiss. If reality hadn't intruded I'm fairly sure I would have reached a point where I would have happily found a use for the morning wood I was sporting.</p>
<p>Reality begin ... the fact Olivia and I both became fully conscious of just who we were kissing at about the same time.</p>
<p>Pulling away from each other, we both stared at the other in shock for a moment, then I got the giggles. Trying to suppress those, I mouthed "Sorry."</p>
<p>Olivia mouthed "You kissed me!"</p>
<p>I made a back-and-forth motion between the two of us to show that I felt it was mutual.</p>
<p>She shook her head and pointed firmly at me. Then at her mouth.</p>
<p>With a shrug of apology, I grinned and leaned in suddenly to try and steal another kiss. Her eyes went wide and she backpedal off the bed and tumbled ass-over-teakettle onto the carpeted floor. My giggles got the best of me at that point.</p>
<p>My sister righted herself, got up in a huff, stuffed her feet in her shoes, and stormed out.</p>
<p>I heard a round of soft "good mornings" outside, so I guess we weren't the first early risers today. Sitting up, I scratched at my scalp. I paused looking at the small playa dust cloud that drifted away from my head. With a sigh for the distant memory that cleanliness was, I pushed myself to my feet and moved over to my footlocker trunk to look for something that would be cool to wear. I could already feel the heat of the Sun on the tent when I stood up.</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>I fished out a tan mesh tank top and a pair of "coffee stain" camo cargo shorts, then another of my many desert scarves. I was only just pulling on my boxers when the flap behind me opened and my sister stepped inside.</p>
<p>"John, I ... whoa, Hubba, Hubba. Sexy man, sexy man. I didn't know I was sleeping next to something that hot last night." Olivia gave a small wolf whistle and then a wink to show she was kidding, but suddenly changed. My sister's face went from amused, to shocked, to horrified. Olivia moved forward and caught the boxers on my left side tugging them down enough to uncover the rest of the scar on that hip. "What in the hell happened here?"</p>
<p>I moved to tug the cloth away but she moved with me keeping that hip bare to her eyes. "Do you mind?" I demanded.</p>
<p>"No. Never. You should know that." My sister tugged the thin boxers down even further. "Fess up. I heard you got wounded, but nothing this big."</p>
<p>I caught her wrist as her hand moved and I was about to be full Monty in front of her. "A bomb went off. I caught some shrapnel from it. They had to go in and dig pieces of metal out of my hip bone. Happy? Now, let go of my underwear."</p>
<p>She leaned in right by my face. "It's not like it would be the first time I ever saw it. Besides, I've kissed you now your mine. Rules are rules."</p>
<p>I smiled, then leaned in close and whispered. "See, I told you that you kissed me."</p>
<p>She blushed, then pursed her lips. "You were kissing me first, then I kissed back, not awake enough to remember who you were."</p>
<p>"Sure sure, excuses excuses." I grinned at her expression. "Can I get dressed now?"</p>
<p>Olivia put her hands on her hips. "I don't care. I came in here to tell you something." At my raised eyebrow she continued "Well two things. We are doing yoga this morning with the camp next door and that breakfast will be ready in a few minutes. So. Hurry up."</p>
<p>As she vanished out of the door I realized that my eyes had dropped to her ass automatically. My sister was wearing incredibly tight stretchy shorts, with ruffles along the bottom edge. They hugged her hips and gave her far more of a shape than what she normally had. Not that what she normally had was bad, to begin with.</p>
<p>Yoga?</p>
<p>As I dressed, my mind went back over the years. Have I ever done yoga?</p>
<p>I've climbed obstacles made of telephone poles and cargo rope. I've crawled through mud under barbwire. Hiked up mountains carrying 50 pounds of mortar rounds. And god knows I've done ascending grade ruck marches, with a full pack and rifle till I thought I was going to die!</p>
<p>But yoga?</p>
<p>Stepping out into the main part of my tent, I was greeted by Tim in a catsuit.</p>
<p>A Julie Newmar, sparkly, skin-tight black body suit, with a gold belt, elbow-length black gloves, and a set of black kitten ears perched atop his head. For all of a second I just stood there, then shrugged it off and moved over to the folding table where there was a breakfast artist at work.</p>
<p>Jim had my two-burner camp stove on high and two silvery metal pans sitting on the blue flames. He was whipping up eggs till they fluffed and folding them into the hot butter. As I watched him tossing in a handful of shredded cheese, I saw a half dozen bowls of various fillings sitting there for these omelets.</p>
<p>"What's your pleasure, John?"</p>
<p>I looked over the topping choices. "Um, mushrooms, onion, and peppers. Both types."</p>
<p>Jim looked back at me. "Really? No meat?"</p>
<p>"Not so much for breakfast." I gave a faint yawn. "At least not this early of a breakfast. Normally I'm a coffee and toast guy till about ten o'clock, then I'm more than ready for a larger full breakfast with sausage and bacon or ham."</p>
<p>Katherine stepped up beside me with an empty plate. "A man after my heart. I too like 'Second Breakfast' more than a heavy meal this early."</p>
<p>I gave her a brief nod, then took a deep breath. "Sorry about last night. Seeing you took me by surprise, is all."</p>
<p>"I understand." She gave me a sad smile. "I wasn't your best friend, all those years ago. In fact, it was my job not to be your friend but to play the hard ass to all of you." She shrugged. "I've had worse reactions. At least you didn't try to take a swing at me. I've had a few do that."</p>
<p>I didn't want to admit to her ... or myself ... just how badly I had wanted to do that very thing last night. Seeing Nurse Gillian so soon after having to pull myself back together from those silly fireworks... .</p>
<p>"I hate to ask, but how are you doing John?" Kathrine gave me a quirky half-smile. "Same as before or better?"</p>
<p>I shrugged. "Same on some days; better on others."</p>
<p>"Do the focus hobbies help?" she asked as Jim flipped both of our omelets over onto the toppings with a skillful double flick of his wrists.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, I let it out between my teeth. "Yeah. The wood carving does. I've even turned it into a nice side business. I make walking sticks. I brought a few to give away."</p>
<p>"That's good. That's really good, John."</p>
<p>And there it was. That insufferable placating tone that had always set my teeth on edge. The way you would talk to an angry snarling dog, telling him he was a "good boy" and "what a good boy he had been" even while you were plotting to slip the catch pole over his throat. I had heard it from her so many times. So many many times.</p>
<p>"Order up!"</p>
<p>I held out my plate without looking above belt level. I wanted to simply crawl away and whimper. Or snarl and make them all go away.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Jim," I said simply, then grabbed a cold Coke out of the cooler by his feet.</p>
<p>Leaving everyone behind, I moved over to my folding chair and sat hunched over my food, eating in silence. I could tell it was delicious, but it could have been scrambled egg mash from an MRE meal for all that I enjoyed it. I looked up only once. The others were gathered closer together. A solid group, chatting away.</p>
<p>Oddly, through my mind at that moment ran the verse. "The time has come to talk of many things. Of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings."</p>
<p>That led me to think of my buddy Danial. Who I shouldn't be thinking of.</p>
<p>And Corporal Alex ... who I shouldn't be thinking of, but who I do think about every day.</p>
<p>I ate the last few bites mechanically. Chewing by habit more than hunger.</p>
<p>"John? John!"</p>
<p>Looking up, I saw that Olivia had moved to stand right in front of me. A few of the others were looking over in our direction. "What?"</p>
<p>"I said, if you're done, I'll take your plate."</p>
<p>Handing her the plate, I stepped back through the curtain behind me. Looking around, I picked up my walking stick, tightening my fingers around the fire-blackened wood till my knuckles shone white. The idea of doing anything with anyone, being around people in any way, was suddenly repellent. It felt as if there wasn't enough air out here on this old lake bed.</p>
<p>I ducked out the curtain and then, as quickly as I could, I was out of the tent and walking briskly in any direction. It didn't matter where or which way.</p>
<p>Behind me, I heard my name called, but then faintly I hear Kathrine's deeper voice telling my sister to just "let him go."</p>
<p>My mind full of lost faces, I walked the encampment. This mad temporary city in the middle of the white waste of a dead lake. The level of mistake I may have made in coming here this week was starting to settle in on my shoulders.</p>
<p>Trying to be alone at Burning Man was like trying to keep your virginity in a Las Vegas brothel when the ladies know you're rich. At every turn, you're being offered something too good to turn down.</p>
<p>Walking out on the playa to look at the art, I was offered rides, cold drinks, coffee (which I happily took) and a half dozen other things. There I was in the middle of no where and someone would peddles up a three wheel bike along side me with a huge tow-behind cooler of fresh lemonade.</p>
<p>Somehow I ended up standing before one of the rather massive wooden art pieces. A wooden hand reach up out of a wave, all made out of two by fours lumber. My eyes took in the grain patterns. The way the individual boards had been carved together and placed so as to make the wood grain flow like water. The incredible lifelike way that the hand seemed to be trying to grab something from the sky.</p>
<p>It was beautiful.</p>
<p>Nearby was a giant oyster pail Chinese takeout box, complete with chopsticks stuck out the top. It even had the wire handle. It had the red "Thank You" and "Enjoy" stenciled on perfectly.</p>
<p>"This place is crazy," I muttered to myself.</p>
<p>Exactly how long I stood out there beside that giant hand I'm not sure. It was finally a desire to find a port-a-let that made me leave it. I walked towards the blue wall of tall boxes, hoping that these at least were not some strange art project. Or that, if it was, that it could still be used.</p>
<p>Opening the first one I walked up to, I stopped and stood there for a moment.</p>
<p>The back interior wall was covered in the classic pink bikini photo of Cheryl Tiegs.</p>
<p>Stepping inside, I again had to pause. It wasn't a poster. It was a painting! Someone had sat inside this port-o-let for hours and hand painted this iconic pin-up poster to a photo realistic level.</p>
<p>Feeling almost as if I had considered taking a piss in an art gallery, I stepped back outside and went to the one next door. No incredible art work graced these blue walls. Just a simple drawing of a bald guy with a big nose and the phrase "Kilroy was here."</p>
<p>Smiling, I suddenly felt a little more at home. That image and slogan had graced the walls of a great many of the latrines at so many of the bases I had been to.</p>
<p>Finishing up, I began to ease my way back towards camp. By now some of the group would have drifted off and I could take a few moments to double check everything. Exhaustion being what it was last night, I was sure that there would be a few things that needed redoing.</p>
<p>As I walked up I saw that Linda and her husband Bill - the last of our group, had finally arrived. Now we were eight. They were unloading gear from an old green Ford Explorer.</p>
<p>Walking up, I offered my hand to Bill. "Good morning. I'm Olivia's brother."</p>
<p>He gave me an enthusiastic handshake. "John, right? Sorry we got in so late; the traffic was murder from the road to the gate. This is Linda ..." He spun around pointing to his wife as she went by with a Rubbermaid. "We're about to go find Kimberly - she's my second cousin, you know -- and start helping her with her art project, just as soon as we get the last of these unloaded. Do you have any idea where your sister, Olivia might be?"</p>
<p>"Not a clue under the sun. She mentioned yoga." Stepping around him, I took the top plastic tote off the stack his wife was carrying. "Let me help you with that."</p>
<p>I about launched it into space it was so light.</p>
<p>Linda smiled at me. "It's mostly string lights and reflective tape. I'm going to decorate bikes as my gifting this week."</p>
<p>Following her, I set down the all but weightless box and went back out to help Bill with a few others. I saw that he had a folding wagon attached to the back of one of their bikes.</p>
<p>Bill brushed dust off his hands. "Well, Kimberly said her project was setting up out on the playa near a pair of wooden hands at ..." He pulled out a small scrap of paper. " ... around 1:30 on the map, closer to the temple."</p>
<p>"I've seen those hands. Um ...?" Taking a second to orient, I pointed off in the right direction. There was now, however, far too many tents, campers, RV's and roving art cars off in that direction to allow him to see. "Off in that direction. It's near a giant Chinese takeout box."</p>
<p>Bill grinned at that. "Excellent."</p>
<p>His wife came walking up, and placed a basket in the tow-behind cart. She smiled at me, but then looked to her husband. "Well, hun, ready to head out?"</p>
<p>He looked back at me, almost as if to ask permission, then nodded to her. "Yep, good to go. Let me grab my hat." Running over to the SUV, he grabbed out an honest to god cowboy Stetson hat. The feathered hatband had to date back to the 80's, I've not seen one since then.</p>
<p>I pointed at it. "Um, no feathers."</p>
<p>He grinned. "They said that at the gate when they saw it. These aren't real feathers, they don't shed, and I attached them in with Systemthree's T-88 epoxy. I got it from work. And ... that stuff is like 7000 PSI. So I'll bet money no one can pull one out."</p>
<p>"Fair enough." Nodding, I had to agree. "If you see my sister out there, tell her I will join y'all in a bit. I want to do a few things here at camp."</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>Watching them pedal away, I sighed. "Decaf, dude. Decaf."</p>
<p>Shaking my head, I slow walked the perimeter of the tent. I checked the stakes, making sure they were still holding. I have never used screw as anchors before with this tent. But then I had never camped in the middle of a dried lake bed before either. My anxiety was wasted though, they were all still holding rock hard. Going inside, I shifted the angle of a couple of the tent poles. Not that they were in any danger of falling over, it was simply OCD making me straighten things.</p>
<p>Looking things over I had to make myself not move stuff that others had left out. Years of military living given me a "everything in it's place" type mentality, and I was in the middle of as far from that thinking as I could probably find myself. With a shrug I left it and made a mental note to have a talk about keeping the camp cleaner.</p>
<p>Walking into my sleeping area, I did smile seeing that I had made my bed this morning. I had been too half asleep to remember doing it, but then I could still do a quarter-bounce tight bed in my sleep, and had many times. I took a moment and straightened up a bit then opened my footlocker trunk.</p>
<p>Here I was as messy as just about anyone not giving a shit. I had simply tossed in the odd stuff that I figured I might want to have, and then a few more things that I could do without but didn't want to.</p>
<p>I was currently looking for one of those.</p>
<p>Spotting the shine of glass, I moved a few things out the way and unburied the sealed jar. Inside the dozen cigars looked as pristine as when I put them in there a few months back. Picking it up, I turned it around till I saw that the Boveda pack was still working well, since the gauge inside read 68% humidity.</p>
<p>Cracking the top the smell of the tobacco came out to greet me. I rolled the jar a bit looking over the selection. The long Davidoff called out to me the way it always does, but I finally pulled two of my Oliva Serie 'V' Melanio Maduro from the jar and sealed it back up.</p>
<p>Fishing around, I found my leather cigar case, with the cutter and my second best lighter.</p>
<p>Stepping outside, I cut the cigar and toasted the end. The first puff was as delicious as the last time I had smoked one. Pulling my hat on, grabbing up my walking stick from by the door, I decided to wander in the general direction of The Man and the many pieces of art beyond him.</p>
<p>Seeing the crowd of people riding around on their bikes made me want to rethink this idea, but I knew that for me, today, the journey out to the playa wasn't about getting to any destination quickly. I wanted to walk and think. To organize the many "chaotic" thoughts running through my head and to try and make them line up into something like a collection of "meaningful" thoughts.</p>
<p>Hence the cigar.</p>
<p>However, I had forgotten about the general insanity that infects the people here. I hadn't managed to even reach the inner circle before I was hugged twice, given a incredibly interesting paracord bracelet, acquired a cup of espresso coffee, and been complimented on my choice of hats.</p>
<p>Then I somehow ended up sitting in a cigar lounge, under a shade tent, discussing cold fusion verses liquid salt reactors. I finished my Maduro, was gifted a Romeo y Julieta. Gifted back my other Oliva and spent two wonderful hours completely relaxed and mentally occupied in enjoyable conversation.</p>
<p>I finally had to leave, but two more people took my place and the conversation changed to Electric cars verses mass public transportation. A conversation that almost drew me back to my borrowed seat.</p>
<p>Walking out onto the playa, I saw the wooden hands in the distance. There was a flurry of activity not too far away. Given that I was only here due to a ticket, given to a woman, to help with that art project and I hadn't even met the people involved or lifted hammer one yet, I headed that direction.</p>
<p>They were building a wooden copy of the Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p>From what I could tell they had three of the base arches in place, and I could see that the fourth was well underway. Nearby there was what must be the second level starting to be put together.</p>
<p>"John! Just who we need."</p>
<p>Olivia was waving to me, and the rest of our camp seemed busy as bees near her. Walking over, I saw that my sister and Kathrine were running hand planers over boards. I saw Jim using a rasp across edges, rounding them over. Bill and his wife Linda were over by the guy with the saw measuring boards. Tim I looked up to see was having the time of his life running LED lighting all over the completed bottom sections.</p>
<p>"So, you're Olivia's brother? I'm Kimberly."</p>
<p>Looking behind me to see who spoke, I had to look down to find her. At maybe four foot six, I simply towered over her. But then I saw in an instant that Kimberly was the type of person who had the commanding personality to be any size and get people to do what she wanted. She was wearing bib overalls with no shirt or bra on under them, and clearly didn't care who saw what. Her blonde hair tumbled out from under a Carhartt cap that had seen plenty of use. She had sawdust for makeup and sweat for perfume. With a smile at my rather frank looking her over, Kimberly jerked her head to the pile of lumber nearby.</p>
<p>"Can you handle the heavy lifting?" she asked. "Or do you have any woodworking skills?"</p>
<p>"I mostly restore old furniture and do woodcarving for a living." I gave a shrug. "Whatever you need I can do."</p>
<p>She grinned. "It's too early in the week to be making me promises like that. If you can get about half that stack over to the saw by the third level I will dance at your wedding."</p>
<p>Looking to where she pointed I saw that a group of guys were laying out boards for what was going to be the third level of this wooden Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p>"How tall are we going?" I asked.</p>
<p>She gave a grin that was half smirk. "If I had the wood I would build it to actual scale, but as is we're shooting for one hundred and eight feet, or one tenth the size of the real one. Afraid of heights?"</p>
<p>I shook my head. "Only the sudden stop if you fall from them."</p>
<p>Leaving the others to what they were doing, I walked over to the wood pile, stripped off my shit and draped it over my walking stick. I put my hat atop it then wrapped my head in my scarf. All the activity was kicking up a good bit of dust here at the base.</p>
<p>Remembering so many work details from years back, I suddenly felt home again. I grabbed the boards and carried them like they were popsicle sticks, happy simply with the physical effort. The dust took the sweat pouring from me and coated me in a layer of white chalky powder.</p>
<p>Once that was done, I was handed a circular saw and put to cutting boards to lengths.</p>
<p>Task after task followed as the day drifted past. There were members of our art group that had no other task than to watch people and make sure no one got too hot. Water was handed out by them almost constantly.</p>
<p>Kimberly moved around the site constantly as well. She had her hands on everything going on. When she was near me I got a chance to look over and saw her looking through a series of photos, blue print copies, and what looked like a drawing on parchment. Her and the guy directing the third section, Chris, seem to have a disagreement for a moment, then he nodded and went back to work.</p>

<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>"Hey there, man candy. I am about spent." Tim came up beside me and bumped my hip. "I'm heading back to camp to clean up and pass out. If you would chase Jim back that way here in a few. He promised to make me his world famous Indian Butter Curry Chicken tonight, and if he doesn't I'm going to have a serious tushy-tantrum."</p>
<p>Rubbing at my eyebrows, I just nodded that I would.</p>
<p>I watched him wheel away on his hoverboard thing, then noticed that a few others were starting to drift away, or peddle off back towards camp as well. Looking around, I saw the signs of exhaustion in the others that I was not yet feeling myself.</p>
<p>Kimberly must have seen it as well.</p>
<p>"Okay people. Lets get out of the sun and take a long break." She clapped her hands. "Anyone who wants to help me with testing the lighting on the bottom section can come back when the sun starts to go down." She flashed everyone a smile. "Otherwise, lets try to get an earlier start tomorrow, if we can. With hope we may finish. We already have the bottom assembly finished, the second section is nearly done, and with some luck the top will be ready to lift it into place by the end of the day tomorrow. And ... maybe ... we will even have it full lighted by the end of tomorrow night."</p>
<p>Everyone gave a cheer. A few people moved over to her to talk about when she wanted to get together to do lighting later.</p>
<p>Walking over to where I had left my shirt and walking stick. Unwrapping my head, I shook out my shemagh scarf and then used it as a towel to brush away the playa dust and sawdust off my chest and arms. A hand on my back turned my head.</p>
<p>Olivia smiled at me. "I'm heading back. Want to walk with me?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>Pulling on my shirt, I wrapped the damp dirty scarf around my waist like a sash. My hat I sat on Olivia's head and we started back to camp.</p>
<p>"I had fun today," she said after a few minutes of silence. She looked up at me from under the wide brim. "How about you?"</p>
<p>"Yes." I glanced back at our three-section wooden project. "For the most part ... today was pretty good."</p>
<p>We walked a bit further in silence then she again tried to break it.</p>
<p>Olivia tilted back the hat. "So ... about this morning ..."</p>
<p>"Yes, kissing you was one of the good parts."</p>
<p>She stopped, and stamped her foot making a dust cloud. "Not that!"</p>
<p>I chuckled. Coming to a stop, I leaned on my walking stick. "Alright, spill it."</p>
<p>"What?" she asked.</p>
<p>I looked at the sunlight blazing down on Black Rock City. The many colors of tents, RV's, tarps, Vans, banners, signage were starting to form a kind of modern art in its own right. "You're upset about this morning. Let me guess, it was me walking off. Right?"</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>Looking down at my hand, I felt the hard work in places. There weren't any blisters, too many old calluses for that to form easily, but my hands were sore. I flexed the fingers savoring the pain.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>I looked up into her eyes. "Olivia, you keep asking me to talk to you. Okay. Here I go. I'm doing the best I can with a bad mental situation. Ninety percent of the time, I'm as good as I get. But the rest of the time I have bad days." My fingers tightened around the walking stick till my sore hands burned. "Sometimes very bad days. They can hit me suddenly. And there is nothing I can do to predict when they happen, or stop them when they do."</p>
<p>"Why not ask for help when that happens?" she asked, not understanding.</p>
<p>I shook my head. "When I'm having one of those I have to ... get away. I don't want help. I don't want to talk." Turning away from her, I looked off towards the Temple. "Hell, about all I want to do is stand on the top of a mountain and scream profanity at Heaven for ever having been born."</p>
<p>I felt her hand on my elbow. Looking down at my sister, I saw that Olivia was on the edge of tears. Putting an arm around her, I pulled her in to me. "Come on, let go get cleaned up and maybe see about something for a very late lunch. I'm good, for now. Make the best of it."</p>
<p>Holding her to me we started walking again.</p>
<p>"So what happened this morning?" She trailed a bit and her hip bumped mine. "I mean when you woke up you sure weren't depressed."</p>
<p>I grinned. "It would take a lot more than PTSD to make waking up naked lying next to a sexy lady to be depressing."</p>
<p>She stopped in her tracks. "We weren't naked!"</p>
<p>"Well, I sure was." Placing both hands on my walking stick, I stood there holding back a shit eating grin. I had been hoping this would come up all day.</p>
<p>My sister shook her head. "You were not naked! You had on boxer shorts, I saw them."</p>
<p>"No, I put those on after you got up and left."</p>
<p>Oh, the color that rushed across her face.</p>
<p>Olivia was almost screaming now. "You let me sleep next to you when you were naked! You were spooned up against me! Naked!"</p>
<p>With a shrug I couldn't deny that. "I kept the sheet between us."</p>
<p>My sister took my hat off her head and began to beat me with it. Laughing, fending her off, I retreated from the fury of a sister spooned.</p>
<p>"John! I ought to beat you within a inch of your life!" She threw my hat at me and stormed off towards camp.</p>
<p>Laughing, I grabbed up my hat out the dust and followed.</p>
<p>The spice level in whatever it was that Jim was cooking was off the scale. And I like hot food. Simply the smell of it when I walked into the tent set my eyes to watering.</p>
<p>Walking through the curtains into my sleeping area, I stripped and went through four of the big size wet wipes to get the sweat and dust off of me. Some simple gray-black "tiger stripe" camo cargo shorts and a loose gray shirt fit my mood perfectly. Stepping back out, I saw that Olivia had changed into something clean, and - like most of her outfits so far -- it showed more than a little skin. Fishnets, a bikini top, and gold shorts that would make a Hooter's Girl blush.</p>
<p>And she wants to bitch about me being naked?</p>
<p>Jim, Linda, and Bill were putting together Cuban sandwiches on the folding table. I looked about for the others but they were either behind their curtained-off section, maybe taking a nap, or had perhaps headed out into town. If that was what they had in mind, I envied them their energy. The nap sounded good to me. Mind you there was a dry oven-like heat that even this tent could not get rid of entirely. Well, not without rolling up the sides. Which I was loath to do in a place as full of powdery dust as this lake bed.</p>
<p>"Fix me a sandwich," Olivia asked, then at my look said "Please?"</p>
<p>I smiled. "As you wish."</p>
<p>My sister rolled her eyes and went to her folding chair, sitting down in a huff.</p>
<p>Jim glanced up when I joined then at the long table. "How are we doing for water?"</p>
<p>That seemed like an odd question this early in the week. "We're good, hardly made a dent in the big tank in the trailer. Why?"</p>
<p>He pointed at the large cooler nearby. "The gallon ones in there are going a bit quicker than I thought they might, but then this is a desert and it's hot as fuck! Cold water is always a blessing."</p>
<p>"True, so very true." Linda looked up from the food. "I feel like I could drink forever and never get the dust out of my mouth." She giggled. "I have come to Burning Man and tasted him."</p>
<p>Jim looked up from his cooking. "Speaking of cold. The YETI will keep ice till ... oh, probably till tomorrow. Then we will definitely need more ice."</p>
<p>I nodded. "I'll get us round one, but if anyone is going past the Center Camp - on your way back here -- after tomorrow, it might not be a bad idea to grab the odd bag, now and then."</p>
<p>Everyone nodded in agreement, then went back to what they were doing.</p>
<p>I was in the middle of eating a second sandwich when Tim came rolling back into the tent on his One Wheel. He popped his goggles up and pulled down his mask. "Um, guys not to be a nervous Nelly, but I think the Apocalypse is coming towards us."</p>
<p>Frowning, I handed Olivia the stacked plate and then went out to see what he was talking about.</p>
<p>The wall of white dust that was engulfing the other side of this crazy city would have been impressive to anyone that had never seen one of the massive "haboob" storms of boiling dust coming across the deserts of the Middle East. And, to be honest, even given that ... it was impressive to see in its own right. It swallowed tent after tent and RV after RV as it rolled forward.</p>
<p>After a long second of watching it, I had to agree with Tim. It was coming right at us.</p>
<p>Stepping back inside, I pointed to the other end of the tent. "Those two poles there ..." I placed my hand on the one next to me. " ... and these two poles here. We need to drop them. Like this."</p>
<p>Picking up the heavy canvas, I leaned the thick wooden pole inward and brought that side of the Bedouin down till it touched the ground. Once it touched, I used the tent pole to pin it to the ground. Looking behind me I saw that Bill and Jim had one of them and Oliva and Tim had the other. Linda had moved to the one next to me. I nodded when she lowered it like mine.</p>
<p>"It won't keep out all of the dust, but it will help. If we were setup in a sand desert the storm would bury the outside edge and that would help a lot." I shrugged. "It is what it is. Anything that might get ruined by dust ... well, it probably shouldn't be here anyway, but let's get it under cover."</p>
<p>"The food!"</p>
<p>We were in the middle of stuffing the sandwich makings back into the coolers and Rubbermaids when the first of the heavy winds hit the side of the tent. The big canvas tent seemed to almost roll under the force and then, like a wave, fall right back into place. Swaying on its poles like a tree's leaf canopy.</p>
<p>Soon trickles of dust were puffing in under the edges. They made the inside hazy. I pulled up my mask, chewing the last bite of my second sandwich behind that thin cloth. I looked around. Everyone seemed tense, looking up at the tent.</p>
<p>"Don't worry. It's road through far far worse than this." I saw a few nodded heads. I quirked an eyebrow when my sister went over to the edge and looked out into the dust storm, letting in twice as much powder at the same time.</p>
<p>"Wow! I can't even see your truck. Hey!" She looked back in at all of us. "There are people walking around out there in it." I saw the grin in Olivia's eyes. "I'm going out. Who's with me?"</p>
<p>"Not, me, and don't get lost."</p>
<p>She walked over the few steps and poked me in the chest. "Participation! Participate!"</p>
<p>I shook my head. "I spent the day doing that, already. I'm going to bed to take an afternoon nap. Given the drumming and thumping last night - and the fact more people have been arriving all day - I'm pretty sure I won't get much sleep tonight." I gestured at her with the back of my hands. "Go if you're going. You're letting in dust."</p>
<p>My sister gave a frump. "Well, I am. Anyone?"</p>
<p>Tim almost bounced. "Me." He gave Jim a peck on the cheek. "If I don't make it back, try and find my body. And remember, hun, I want to be cremated and my ashes added to a pot of spicy chili."</p>
<p>Olivia and Tim disappeared into the dust about a foot out of the door.</p>
<p>With a shrug for insanity, I headed to my bed. It was calling my name like a lover.</p>
<p>Sleeping with my shemagh scarf across my face had once been an everyday thing for me. Now it felt smothering, but as my eyes slowly opened and I took in the layer of white dust on the bed beside me I was glad that I had. Sitting up the dust drifted off of me to the floor.</p>
<p>The inside of the tent was stifling.</p>
<p>Standing up, I took the time to pull on my shorts, then walked out into the common area. I saw that Kathrine and Gloria were sitting together by the table, talking in low voices. They glanced up as I entered.</p>
<p>"Storm over?" At their nods, I pointed to the ends of the Bedouin. "Let's open her back up then. Let the breeze take some of this dust and heat out."</p>
<p>With their help, it took almost no time to stand back up the four end poles and roll up the darker canvas panels. The cool air that came in was still oven hot, but it was several degrees cooler than the stale air inside. Looking out, seeing the sun easing towards the horizon, I realized just how long I had slept. I watched a group of people ride by on bicycles, which brought to mind the fact I hadn't even gotten mine out of the truck yet.</p>
<p>All around us, people were gearing up for a long night of party hopping. Music was already rising from a dozen places. In the distance, I saw a column of orange fire burst forth and rise into the sky as someone tested a pyro effect of some type.</p>
<p>"You going out tonight, John? You should."</p>
<p>Looking over my shoulder, I saw that Kathrine was standing there holding out a cold beer to me. I looked at it for a second then up at her face. There didn't seem to be any hidden test behind those eyes, but then she had played so many games with me years ago.</p>
<p>I eyed the label. "It's not my brand."</p>
<p>She smiled. "It's cold. It's wet. It's beer."</p>
<p>Nodding agreement to that, I took it and popped the top on the bottle, pocketing the metal cap by habit. It spilled across my tongue icy and delicious. "Offering alcohol to a man who once had a problem with alcohol. Any particular reason?"</p>
<p>She shook her head. "No particular reason. To get you to relax, maybe." With a small smile, she looked past me out into the city. "This is a good place for people like us. Ones that saw the horrors that humanity can create and the ones that dealt with the aftermath. The wonder and glam of all this; while still being tough and taxing to the body is a good thing."</p>
<p>"Could do without the fireworks."</p>
<p>She gave a shrug. "Call it hard-knocks therapy. Now..." Kathrine stepped back, caught the bottom of her shirt, and pulled it up over her head. Rather large breasts, topped with wine-dark nipples dropped out into view. "I'm going out topless because I can. Have a fun night."</p>
<p>Blinking, I stood there for several moments after she walked past me.</p>
<p>With a shake of my head, I swallowed the rest of the beer in a long gulp and then decided I wanted a second one ... of my brand. Grabbing my belt, cup, and walking stick I headed for the bar of Robert the Pirate. Pausing by the truck, I grabbed a second walking stick from behind the seat to gift to him.</p>
<p>Besides, being mildly drunk might help me with the fireworks. It used to help with the gunfire, after all.</p>
<p>With a belly full of Guinness beer and way too many corn dogs, I wished Robert a good night and then took to wandering the playa. My hat had been pulled off my head, a set of battery LED lights clipped all around it by a lovely young woman so I was now a walking lighted head in the darkness.</p>
<p>I stood for I don't know how long watching a metal octopus shoot fire. Mesmerizing.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the power of the place, the light show, or the huge numbers that were gathering around it, but I found my feet carrying me to the party around Mayan Warrior. By then I was more than a little buzzed, but not really drunk.</p>
<p>A lady in nothing but body paint with a bottle of ... I don't know what the fuck I drank, but damn it was good ... took care of that problem. For the next hour, I did a semblance of dancing. More a drunken sway to the music but everyone else seemed to be doing more or less the same thing.</p>
<p>Feeling a tug on my belt, I followed a lady with lighted fairy wings away from the party.</p>
<p>Then she kissed me.</p>
<p>We spent several minutes engaged in a delightfully playful exchange of lips and tongues before she pulled back enough to look at my face ... then frowned.</p>
<p>"Tom?"</p>
<p>I shook my head. "Sorry, no. I'm John."</p>
<p>She laughed, put a hand on my chest, gave me a cute little pat, then she kissed me one last time then vanished back into the edge of the crowd.</p>
<p>Mildly confused by this exchange -- I mean how often does an angel kiss you by mistake -- I shook my head to clear the alcohol fog a bit and turned towards what I thought was the general direction of my camp. Singing along with a camp playing Simple Minds- "Don't You Forget About Me" on repeat, I let my feet carry me home. Nope, feet are drunk too it seems. It took me looking up and seeing that The Man towering over me to make me realize I was not going the right way.</p>
<p>I had yet to be able to get this close to him, and my eyes took in the quality of wood joinery the many lights showed me. Promising myself to come back and take a look in the sunlight tomorrow, I spun around. Orienting by the points of the clock, I finally made the right choice.</p>
<p>My big tent was empty when I arrived. Empty, dark, and smelling of curry chicken. I fixed the lack of light and then decided I was hungry. Then realizing I was too drunk to prepare a hot meal, sat down in my chair and ate the spicy chicken cold. It went great with Pringles, and sliced cheese. Looking down my eyes focused on the many rugs. The dust level in here needed to be addressed tomorrow. Blinking, I looked up and thought back to different times. Different dust.</p>
<p>Leaning over, I fished my hand around in my leather bag and pulled out a metal hip flash. I stared at the unit logo engraved on it for a moment, then unscrewed the top. I held it up.</p>
<p>"Here's to you guys," I whispered.</p>
<p>The moonshine burned. The hints of Vanilla and cane sugar were perfectly balanced with that burn. Sitting back, letting my head rest against the nylon back of the chair, listened to the music of the surrounding camps, and I thought of the many places I have been. The many places I have lived. The people I have met, the women I have known. The sunsets, the sunrises.</p>
<p>I thought of many many things, but every time I felt even a hint of an unwanted thought trying to ambush me, I would take another sip. And that memory would be burnt away.</p>
<p>Getting up, I glanced at my watch. Then I blinked a few times and tried it again.</p>
<p>"How the fuck is it 3:20 in the morning?"</p>
<p>Simply acknowledging I had lost a few hours at some point, I shrugged and decided enough was enough for one night. It had been a long day with interrupted sleep. Besides, we had to try and finish the wooden Eiffel Tower tomorrow, if possible.</p>
<p>Leaving my walking stick by my chair, my lighted hat hanging atop it, I stepped behind my curtained-off area and stripped out of my clothes. Shivering in the night chill, I lifted the sheet and crawled into bed.</p>
<p>And found myself not alone.</p>
<p>Blinking to drive back the sleep, I flipped over quickly and found myself looking down into my sister's lovely face. The light outside casting odd shadows, but her eyes opened with a sparkle.</p>
<p>"Olivia?"</p>
<p>She snuggled in closer to me and mumbled. "It was cold in my bed. You have better blankets. Hold me. You let the chill in!"</p>
<p>"Um, sis ... you know how I sleep, remember?"</p>
<p>"John, I don't care you're warm." She shivered. "Snuggle me, already. I'm cold."</p>
<p>Going with it, I pulled her in closer to me. The curves of her matching up with me. Reaching down, I pulled up another of my Indian blankets from by the foot of the bed. Between us, the heat under those blankets soared.</p>
<p>"John ... do you think I'm pretty?"</p>
<p>I chuckled. "Fishing for compliments?"</p>
<p>Olivia shook her head under my chin. "I was at a party ... and I was being flirty ... and I couldn't make any headway. That's why I wanted to ask."</p>
<p>I could hear the tears hiding under her words.</p>
<p>Shaking my head, trying not to laugh I hugged her to me. "Sis, there are probably a few hundred women walking around here tonight that are naked. Now, while it is true that a half-naked, inebriated woman is normally a quick go-to for many guys, here it's not even unusual." I absently brushed the hair back from her eyes. They glowed with un-shed tears in the dim light. "You're beautiful. A pain in the ass, sure, but incredibly beautiful."</p>
<p>I could see the smile. "Thanks." Then she chuckled. "Too bad you're my brother. I'm horny enough you could get it with just a few more compliments and a couple of kisses."</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>"That so? Tempting, sis. You're too good of a kisser."</p>
<p>Leaning in, I was going to place a single kiss on the end of her nose, but she shifted her face and our lips met. I was about to pull back when her hands closed around my back and pulled me closer. For the second time this week, I found myself kissing my sister with an enjoyable level of passion. That I was once again also naked this time, as then, was also memorable. Also, being pressed up against her, bare skin to near-bare skin was making this moment even more intense.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>My nose brushed her, and breathing in the breath that was my name I nodded. "I know. We can't."</p>
<p>She snuggled her face in by my ear. "But I want to. I want to, so badly."</p>
<p>"Me too."</p>
<p>Olivia gave a small sniffle. "Does that make us sick? For wanting to do that?"</p>
<p>I kissed the tip of her nose. "No, just human, drunk, and horny. Now ... if I'm not going to get laid tonight, I need to turn over. I'll never get to sleep with you pressed up against me like this." I grinned remembering something my Top once told me. "I can sleep on something hard far easier than I can sleep with a hard-on."</p>
<p>"Can you spoon against my back?" she asked me.</p>
<p>"Sure." I nodded even though I knew that if I was pressed against her ass I was just asking for at least an hour of denied desire and misery before I would be able to sleep.</p>
<p>My sister positioned herself and I felt my cock press against the soft cotton of her panties. The warm softness of her back pressed into my chest. Moving my arm around above her head, I snuggled her into the nested pocket of space under my arm. My eyes were feeling heavy, but the smell of her hair in my nose and she was warm and soft and I so badly wanted to feel every part of her.</p>
<p>Olivia took my hand from her belly and brought it up to place atop her bare breast. I couldn't help myself, I had to give it a comfortable squeeze. She gave a low moan, wiggled her butt back against the hardness of my cock, and then made a sound, kind of an appreciative purr.</p>
<p>"Love you, goodnight."</p>
<p>I hugged her tighter. "Goodnight, sis."</p>
<p>Holding her to me, I heard when her breathing changed. With her breast in my hand, hard nipple pushing against my palm, her warm bottom hard up against my cock it took me much much longer to drift away myself.</p>
<p>As sleep took me, my last thought was that I would happily have stayed this way forever.</p>
<p>(Day 3)</p>
<p>Sobriety must have assaulted my sister upon waking up, given that she fled my bed quickly and without a word. For myself waking up in a bed smelling of a woman was a nice bit of novelty.</p>
<p>Sitting up, I sat on the edge of the bed and listened to the others moving around outside my cloth walls. They were making enough noise that I was honestly surprised that I had slept through it. The pretty bad hangover I was feeling notwithstanding, Honestly though, I didn't feel too bad for a day of hard work in the heat and a night of partying. Knowing we had more work to do today, I chose my clothes for that, and by the time I stepped out to join the others, I was almost what could be called awake.</p>
<p>Coffee helped the rest.</p>
<p>I caught everyone before they vanished. "I know we're working on the tower today, but at some point, we need to do a bit of housekeeping here. Keeping the dust out completely is a lost cause, but making an effort will make the week a lot more comfortable. From what I saw we're still running pretty good on our supplies. Any surprises I don't know about yet?"</p>
<p>Jim piped up. "Propane for this little stove?"</p>
<p>"There are plenty of extra bottles in the back of my van. I'll get them out." I looked around.</p>
<p>My sister piped up. "Batteries. We're using up a lot more of them for the lights at night than I thought we would. We can't be dark-tards simply because we're out of batteries."</p>
<p>Tim looked over at her, batting his eyelashes. "That's right, blame the lights for using up the batteries. Could have nothing to do with a certain vibrating sound I've heard."</p>
<p>Everyone but me laughed at Olivia's blush.</p>
<p>Kathrine spoke up. "I have a small solar panel I use to recharge the battery in my phone. If they are rechargeable batteries we can use it for that too. I'll look into it, but if there is a battery to spare in this whole camp it will surprise me."</p>
<p>"I'll ask around," I promised. With a grin, I pointed to a few outfits, and the skin showing. "Remember sunscreen today. Dealing with several bad sunburns would make for an incredibly long week for us all." I glanced around at the others. "Anything else? Is water consumption still good? No signs of dehydration?"</p>
<p>Everyone nodded.</p>
<p>"Okay, then. Kimberly is waiting for us." I got to my feet and brushed the wetness from my palms. "Let's get this done so we can simply enjoy the rest of the week."</p>
<p>Stepping outside, I decided to dig my bike out of the back of the trailer. I've done enough walking for the next few. Besides I wanted to carry a few odd tools I had with me. Standing by the truck, I was cutting and lighting an Olivia V Melanio cigar when I felt a touch on my elbow. Looking around I saw my sister looking at me a bit shamefaced.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about last night. I was drunk."</p>
<p>Nodding, I gently torched the growing red cherry on the cigar. "Me too."</p>
<p>She looked down. "Let's just pretend it didn't happen, okay?"</p>
<p>"If you want." I gave a small shrug. "Other than a bit of touching and some kissing, nothing much did happen."</p>
<p>Olivia bit her bottom lip, then looked away. I heard her mutter. "It nearly did."</p>
<p>Smiling, I lifted her chin with a finger. "No. I wouldn't have gone that far. Not with us both drunk. Now, if you had crawled into my bed sober and I was sober... well, let's just say that we would be having a different conversation this morning."</p>
<p>My sister gave me a small grin. "Oh, really?" Then with a flirty look, she reached out and took my cigar away from me, and walked off smoking it.</p>
<p>With a grimace, I reached into my pocket and dug back out my cutter and a second cigar.</p>
<p>Following my sister and the trail of sweet smoke she was leaving behind out onto the playa I could already see the people gathering around our wooden copy of the Eiffel Tower. Some seemed to be just watching, but most seemed to be lending a hand. As I walked up I saw that, in the distance, a large yellow crane was making its slow ponderous way across the playa in our direction.</p>
<p>Kimberly was running around like a chicken with her head cut off directing a dozen people at once. She had somehow finished ninety percent of the assembly on the second section last night. She saw me, grabbed me by the arm, and put me in charge of getting the top section finished. Then she was off moving to put out another problem on the second section's rigging before the crane got here.</p>
<p>With a grin and a shrug to the others working on the top section, I got to work.</p>
<p>The hands of the clock over the next four hours alternated between flying and crawling. The heat grew by the hour as the Sun rose higher and higher. As we got closer to completion more and more people began to funnel in to help. Soon it was hundreds working like ants. It was just past noon when the last bolt was tightened on the top section and we were done.</p>
<p>I signaled Kimberly from where I was standing by top of the tower that we were ready for the crane and she gave me a thumbs up.</p>
<p>The big boom swung around, the operator cabled down and I hooked the two yellow straps to the hook. As he slowly lifted the tower section from horizontal to vertical, I made sure to keep a good solid hand on the guide rope. There were four of us holding it steady as we slowly swung this section over and above the finished bottom and second story already assembled. As we eased it down there were a dozen workers up on the wooden structure guiding the large threaded bolts down into the guide holes and getting it to come to rest. At Kimberly's direction, wrenches went to work and the whole structure was locked together as one solid piece.</p>
<p>"John, you ready?" Kimberly asked me when I climbed up next to her.</p>
<p>Leaning outward, I looked up at the top of the tower. "Yep."</p>
<p>Reaching up, I caught a beam overhead and started the long climb up the tower. That I in my flat brim Stetson hat must look like a weird cowboy King Kong was an inner amusement as I neared the top. Hooking my legs around the top beams as best I could, I caught the cable in one hand and the hook in another. The headache ball was close to living up to its name. With everything steady, I met eyes with the crane operator and gave him a head nod and a "cable out" motion with one hand.</p>
<p>As the tension left the crane and the tower's full weight settled onto it's base, I felt the big tower rocking under me. A slow swaying back and forth.</p>
<p>The straps were wedged together tight on the hook and I had to beat at them to get them to turn loose, but after that it was easy to slide them up and out. Holding the strap loops clear of the tower, I waved the operator a "take it away" signal and he took the straps up and away from our construction.</p>
<p>Waiting as the sway died out before I climbed back down, I sat there a hundred feet up looking out over at all of Black Rock City laid out before me. I could see the top of the Temple and the Man. Wishing it was night, I knew I was going to have to come and climb back up here later tonight to see this view in the dark with everything lit up.</p>
<p>I suddenly felt a ton of vibrations and looking down I saw that dozens of the workers were all climbing up here towards where I was sitting perched. Grinning, I took off my hat and held on as the tower top swayed under their actions.</p>
<p>Kimberly reached me first with a big grin on her face. "Hey John, how is the view?"</p>
<p>"Awesome. Here, I'm in your seat." Swinging around, I found footholds and moved out of the way to allow her to climb up to the top perch. I stood there and looked around for a few minutes, then giving her bare leg a pat and started down through the cluster of people slowly climbing up here to the top.</p>
<p>I found Tim stopped at around the top of the second level, unable to move up or down. Frozen in fear. It took me several minutes talking to him calmly to manage to get him to climb down with me.</p>
<p>He gave me a quick hug when we got to the ground. "Oh, thank you, I've never been scared of heights before in my life! I don't know what happened."</p>
<p>I shrugged. "It happens. Don't sweat it."</p>
<p>"Thanks." He fanned his face with his fingers. "Oh, and speaking of sweat, I am so in need of a good bath. I must smell like a New Orleans streetwalker on dollar beer night."</p>
<p>Grinning, I looked up at the tall wooden tower. "By this weekend we will probably all wish we smelled as good as we do now."</p>
<p>He took a few quick steps over and brought me back a bottle of water. "If that ain't the truth. But, honey, you smell so masculine I'm about to faint. Leather, sweat, cigar smoke, and is that bay rum aftershave?"</p>
<p>I nodded. "I learned from a squad mate back in Afghanistan that it's strong enough to cover up the smell of several days without a wash. And I liked it, so."</p>
<p>"Um, hum. Well, I must say that if you could bottle... " He made a waving gesture with his hand. " ... all of that, I know a dozen bears that would give a testicle to smell like that." Tim licked his lips, then his eyes jerked up. "Oh, look out incoming."</p>
<p>Glancing up, I heard "Catch me" just in time to throw out my arms to catch my sister. The force of her hitting me tumbled the both of us down onto the playa. My back hit and amid the cloud of dust, I found her right in front of my face.</p>
<p>My right hand needed badly to be moved off her ass but my arm was pinned by my sister's arm. "Hi back. What's with the skydiving?"</p>
<p>"Slipped."</p>
<p>Lifting my hand, I gave her butt a light pop. "Well, good thing I was here then. Now, do you plan to get up off of me?"</p>
<p>She squirmed a little. "Well, I'm comfortable."</p>
<p>"Um, huh."</p>
<p>Bringing my knees up, I freed my hands and then I went for the short ribs.</p>
<p>"NO! No, stop it. Quit it!"</p>
<p>Tim was about to laugh himself to death by the time Olivia got up off of me and tried to get away from my tickling fingers. Flipping off my back to my feet, I gave chase around the Eiffel Tower. Then we were dodging in and out of the big corner pillars.</p>
<p>I finally had to give up, resting my hand on one wooden corner as I tried to catch my breath. My sister had taken to hiding behind a few of the others and they were either protecting her or trying to get out of my way.</p>
<p>"Children!"</p>
<p>We all looked over at Kimberly as she climbed back down and touched playa.</p>
<p>"Thank you all for your help this burn. I've never managed to get my project finished faster." We all gave a cheer. "Next year I welcome any of you to come and join me again. Not sure what we will be building, but it will be at least as spectacular as this year's project was. Again, thank you all!" She held up her hand. "And remember, this bit of art will burn after The Man burns. I intend to carry fire from The Man to this tower and light it from that. So please, please I ask you all to make the time to be here with me ... to see all of our hard work ascend as sparks and smoke up to the stars!"</p>
<p>We all cheered.</p>
<p>As people began to drift away I stood there looking up at what we had built. Knowing that it was going to be set fire to at the end of the week tore at my heart a little. There was serious woodworking artistry here, and not a little bit of engineering skill had been used to pull this off. For it to be fed to the flames seemed almost a crime. But then I felt the same about The Temple I had visited. That structure was such an exquisitely crafted place it felt like an ancient church. It needed only to have been made of stone and it could have stood for centuries.</p>
<p>But then this whole mad city was temporary. Here one week, gone the next leaving nothing behind to say it was here but the odd bit of missed moop to be picked up by the last volunteers. I was suddenly hit by how much like life this place really was. Appear out of nowhere. Grow into something impressive and fun, then burned out and be nothing but ashes. Ashes on the wind.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>Looking over at my sister, I gave her a small sad smile.</p>
<p>"You okay?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm okay." I held out my hand and took hers. "I guess."</p>
<p>My sister gave me an understanding look, then a small wistful look crossed her face only to vanish almost instantly. She let go of my fingers one by one. "Hungry?"</p>
<p>I nodded. "As a hunter."</p>
<p>She jerked her head back towards camp. "Let's go do something about that."</p>
<p>We walked over to where our bikes were parked. The ride back to camp was relatively short, but I felt my mood lighten as I followed her. No one could stay downhearted watching her butt cheeks, in those short shorts, squirm from side to side on that bike seat.</p>
<p>When we parked our bikes, I hooked her arm and we walked inside like that.</p>
<p>Tim and the others had beat us back to camp.</p>
<p>Tim was naked ... and painting himself blue.</p>
<p>While everyone else made sandwiches and fruit salad.</p>
<p>Walking out to my van, I dug out an old bottle of Bulleit Bourbon I had held back on just in case. I could already tell it was going to be a "just in case" kind of night.</p>
<p>Around all the theme camps and out at some of the bigger art cars the crowds began to gather as the sun vanished. Music thundered out. The dancing roving hoards of people had become gigantic as more and more "Burners" were still arriving by the thousands.</p>
<p>Dragged out of the tent by my sister and Gloria, I somehow found myself at what must have been the largest of them. Mayan Warrior and Robot Heart had come together out on the playa and</p>
<p>the powdery dust underfoot shook with the power of that many speakers and amplifiers. The raining sweat of a thousand dancers was the only thing that kept it damped down a bit.</p>
<p>With those two lovely ladies on either side of me, grinding their sexy young bodies against mine, I did my part to help keep the dust down.</p>
<p>Overhead as the last bit of sunlight died a green laser display began to appear. We all reached up and tried to grab those lines of light whenever they came close. The music was rhythmic, without real lyrics but with bits of odd vocals tossed in by the DJ's up there running the show.</p>
<p>As the cool of the desert night began to gather, the girls - all but naked in their costume choices tonight - danced closer to me for warmth. All around us strings of lights showed where people were in the darkness. Weird patterns of moving lights appeared and then morphed into other shapes.</p>
<p>Olivia who at that moment was dancing behind me, suddenly tugged my hip flask from my back pocket. She took a sip, her eyes flashed wide and she let out a breathy loud "wooo!" sound, then she passed it to Gloria who nearly went cross-eyed when she decided to sniff at it first. She took a smaller sip than my sister had, then a really tiny second one before handing it to me. Grinning, I tossed back a good shot's worth of the vanilla moonshine and put it back in my pocket.</p>
<p>Gloria leaned in right by my face and had to shout. "That will warm you up!"</p>
<p>I nodded, grinned, and then turned around as Olivia tugged at my arm. Gloria plastered herself against my back and did a bump and grind against my ass. My sister wrapped her arms around me and pulled Gloria closer with me hugged in the middle.</p>
<p>The music hit a low point lull.</p>
<p>"Hey, big brother. Up for a three-way?" my sister asked with a flirty grin. She leaned in and flashed Gloria a smile. "Think we could wear this handsome man out before morning?"</p>
<p>The music pulsed back up, but I heard Gloria scream "Definitely!" by my ear.</p>
<p>With a wink, my sister gave me a kiss, mostly a light peck, but still hot. Then she and Gloria turned me around and Gloria was kissing me. Not at all one to complain about this treatment, I gave as good a kiss as I could before my sister stole me back for her second, much longer kiss.</p>
<p>Just how serious she might be about a "Three way" began to play through my thoughts as I was turned back around one more time.</p>
<p>Gloria draped her arms around my neck and looked up into my eyes. She pulled back from my chest and bit and I saw her look over my shoulder to my sister and nod her head. Olivia's hands snaked under my arms and, for a moment, I feared a tickle attack, but then her hands appeared in front of me, caught the cloth of Gloria's silvery bikini top, and tugged it down till two small rosy pink nipples appeared. Rather resembling raspberries, they drew my eye with a hunger. When I looked back up she smiled at the lust in my eyes.</p>
<p>The music pulsed down.</p>
<p>"We thought you deserved a treat," Gloria said rubbing her bare breasts against my chest. She leaned in by my ear as the music rose again. "Figured we've all put you through so much trouble with us camping newbs." She grinned and leaned in till her breath was hot on my ear. "Tim wanted to be involved when he heard our plan, but Olivia shot that down."</p>
<p>I nodded and leaned in by her ear. "Right. No Blue Man group tonight."</p>
<p>She giggled and went back to dancing.</p>
<p>Olivia spun me around to her. I saw her mouth. "Want to see mine, too?"</p>
<p>Grinning, I nodded.</p>
<p>With that mischievous smile, my sister pulled her bikini top up, and her breasts, larger than Gloria's by a cup size at least, appeared with a drop bounce. Crowned as they were by larger and darker nipples, they looked magnificent. Behind me, Gloria shouted her approval.</p>
<p>The two topless women were now dancing with me as a human stripper pole they rotated around between them.</p>
<p>A second round from my hip flask was desired. Demanded really. I knew that the alcohol wasn't going to last long the way they now seemed to take gulps rather than sips. But then I also knew it was strong enough that neither would they. As that wicked vanilla-flavored corn juice began to take hold of them they slowed to a rhythm not quite with the music, but so sensual I was not at all unhappy to be involved.</p>

<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>More kisses ensued, then a groping of my crotch from each of them that left me more than a little hard. They seemed to think that was funny as hell and did their best to keep me in such a state for the rest of the time we danced. With almost every movement they or I made I would feel a woman's hand pass over my crotch. Hell, even some of the ladies around us seemed to get in on the act, judging by the number of times it happened and the grins I saw on their faces.</p>
<p>In one of the times when the music dipped low Olivia leaned in close to me. I was expecting another kiss, but she brushed her lips past my cheek and mouthed by my ear. "I need to go to the port-o-let. Grab Gloria and let's drift that way." She gave her head a jerk towards the edge of the crowd.</p>
<p>Turning, I saw that between the music, exhaustion and the alcohol Gloria was in a kind of dancing trance-like state. To be honest if not for all the attention a part of my anatomy had been receiving I might be in a similar state myself. Catching her arm, she looked at me and grinned, and tried to give me another kiss. Letting it be a quick one, I leaned in to by her ear and said, "Follow me."</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>Wading through the sea of humanity, we made our way to the edge of the throng of people. It wasn't an easy passage as many wanted us to stay and dance with them. But smiles and denials got us out of those invitations. Gathered around this massive group was a small sea of lights as dozens of smaller art cars had clustered in to join the raging party.</p>
<p>A guy in a striped shirt, standing on what looked like a genuine, if brightly lit, Venetian gondola gestured to us.</p>
<p>"Need to go somewhere?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Port-o-lets!" My sister was all but doing a pee-pee dance by now. "Please."</p>
<p>"Hope aboard!" Hand on the tiller pole at the back, he had the boat turning on a dime and we headed across the open playa.</p>
<p>Leaning over, I tried to look under the boat but it was too dark. When I looked back at him he was grinning. When he answered it was clearly a silent question he had been asked many times.</p>
<p>"It's built on the frame of two old electric golf carts. Eight tires, each with an electric motor, all running off the batteries in the box here behind me. I steer by the wheel on the end of this pole." He pushed the long pole and we swerved wide.</p>
<p>"And the throttle?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Under my foot." He shifted his stance and the boat slowed a bit. "Brakes by resistance. Takes a bit of getting used to, but the playa is large enough to give me plenty of room to practice."</p>
<p>Gloria was looking around as we almost seemed to float past other art cars. "This is magical."</p>
<p>Ahead of us the Temple, aglow in lights, appeared. He turned us and I saw off to the side of it was a dark wall capped with blue lights which - as we drew nearer - we saw was a line of blue bathrooms. When we stopped Olivia all but sprinted off the boat and to the line of blue huts. She went from one to the other then, for a couple of seconds hunting for toilet paper, then dove inside one.</p>
<p>Next to me, Gloria curled up tight to my side. She gave a small shiver.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the gondolier gestured to the seat across from us. "There is a blanket there behind the bench."</p>
<p>Reaching across, I picked up the soft wool cloth, shook the dust from it, or tried to, and draped it around Gloria's shoulders. As I sat back down she pulled it around and laid it across our legs. Again the little redhead snuggled into my side.</p>
<p>She whispered by my ear. "I want to go back to camp, get naked, and screw like weasels."</p>
<p>Then she gave a mighty yawn and I chuckled. "By the time we get back to camp, you will probably want PJs and sleep."</p>
<p>She paused for a second, then Gloria gave a sad nod and yawned again. "Probably so." Another yawn nearly cracked her head. "Damn it." She looked off into the darkness. "I wish Olivia would hurry up. I wonder if she fell asleep in there?"</p>
<p>"There she comes."</p>
<p>My sister climbed up into the boat, saw the blanket, and plopped down next to us huddling under it. "You would not believe what was in that bathroom!"</p>
<p>The gondolier interrupted. "Where to now?"</p>
<p>Turning in my seat, I looked back over my shoulder at him. "Back to our camp, if you please. We're at 7:00 and H."</p>
<p>"Sure thing." All but silently the boat began to move across the deep playa. He swung the pole and the wheel turned us in a big loop and he headed us back towards the many lights of Black Rock City.</p>
<p>"So what was in the port-o-let?" I asked when I looked back at my sister.</p>
<p>"Someone had taken the time to write down the lyrics to Nations of the World. The whole song!" At my odd look, she made a rolling motion with her hands. "Yakko! The Animaniacs! United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru..."</p>
<p>Gloria giggled and began to sing along. "Republic Dominican, Cuba, Caribbean, Greenland, El Salvador too."</p>
<p>Behind us, the gondolier let out a belly laugh and joined in. "Puerto Rico, Columbia, Venezuela, Honduras, Guyana, and still ... ."</p>
<p>With the three of them singing the names of all the countries of the world we wove our way across the dark playa, the gondolier swerving from side to side, slaloming around each bundle of light appearing before us. Be it a bike, art car, or wandering hippie lost in the dark with a flashlight.</p>
<p>Him we circled, stopped beside, and gave a ride.</p>
<p>Of course, he joined in with the singing.</p>
<p>Passing it around, we also finished off the last of the moonshine in my hip flask.</p>
<p>Which is when I broke out the bourbon flask from my inner coat pocket.</p>
<p>As the boat left us to vanish into the darkness, Olivia and I took each of Gloria's elbows and guided her into the Bedouin. She was smiling at us, and stumbling. Taking her to the area of the tent she had walled off, I left my sister helping the young woman get into her PJs and poured into her bed.</p>
<p>Sitting on the side of my bed, I pulled off my boots with a moan of relief. Setting them aside, I was in the process of pulling off my vest when Olivia opened the curtain and stepped inside.</p>
<p>"She asleep?" I asked.</p>
<p>My sister nodded. "Out like a light before her head hit the pillow. Can't say I'm far behind her. The stuff in your flasks is evil."</p>
<p>Chuckling, I tossed my vest onto the bag with my dirty clothes. "Sleeping here tonight, again? I don't mind, just asking."</p>
<p>My sister gave a nod. Then she seemed a bit shy. "Um, I had planned a bit more than that, but we .. Gloria and I ... well, we had a plan for some fun."</p>
<p>Lifting an eyebrow, I gave my head a tilt. "The threesome you mentioned?"</p>
<p>She shrugged. "Well, maybe not that far but we figured a two-girl group snuggle fest in your bed would have been fun. She and I ... well, she and I have had a bit of fun in the past. It was fun, and we're mostly just friends now, but well ... Gloria ... Gloria doesn't always know when too much is too much. Since we got here she really started wanting ... well, us ... you, me, and her ... to do a bit more than just snuggle." Olivia tugged at her hair. "I mean, I am your sister."</p>
<p>I gave a lifted eyebrow. "Yes ...."</p>
<p>"Well, she has this unfulfilled fantasy ..." Olivia made a kind of side-to-side rocking that was cute. " ...and she wants me to help, and we figured this festival was the perfect place for it." My sister blushed. "We talked about it a couple of times before, and we both said if we met a cool guy we both like we might give it a try. And, well she likes ... you."</p>
<p>My eyebrows climbed up a good half inch. "Yes?"</p>
<p>"She wants to kiss me" Olivia was almost scarlet with blushing embarrassment now. "With a guy's .. um, cock, between our mouths."</p>
<p>It took me a half moment to visualize that, then a slow smile began to grace my lips. "That would be fun."</p>
<p>My sister looked down, biting at her bottom lip. "I don't know that I could do that. I mean kissing you is one thing, that's just for fun, right?"</p>
<p>I gave a small shrug. "Sure. Or it could be more if we wanted it to be."</p>
<p>Her pretty eyes were suddenly boring holes in my face. "Would you want to ... you know ... with me I mean? Really?"</p>
<p>Chuckling, I reached over to my open trunk and took out a pack of large wet wipes. Taking one I began to try and get rid of some of the playa dust. "You are a beautiful young woman. I have to really strain my brain to find a genuine reason not to want to ... you know ... with you. That you're my sister, well, that certainly makes the list, true, but ... to be honest, it's not the strongest argument I've got against it."</p>
<p>While she stood there looking flustered I finished cleaning myself up, as best I could. I was getting that strong urge to get a real shower. I could remember those urges from back when I was in the Army, deployed when we would be out on patrol for days away from our firebase. Sweaty, grungy, sticky, and just wanting to wash all that away.</p>
<p>"I used to think about it."</p>
<p>Looking back at my sister in mild surprise, I felt a grin creep up. "Really?"</p>
<p>Olivia nodded. She held out her hand towards the packet of towels. "Please?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>Handling her the wipes, I sat back on my bed and with unembarrassed interest watched my sister clean herself up. I saw that despite the use of sunscreen, she was developing a reddish hue to her skin. Odd tan lines from the various costumes she had worn this week crossed her skin like a road map to some strange and exotic land. A place of curvy roads, and hidden cul-de-sac valleys where forbidden secrets were kept hidden from the world at large. She turned her back to me and my eyes took in the curves of her hips, the soft line of her spine from nape to the twin dimples. The silvery curves of her ass in that bikini were a delight to the eye.</p>
<p>My sister looked back and caught me looking at her. For a second Olivia looked surprised to see the lust in my eyes, then she chuckled.</p>
<p>"So?" I asked.</p>
<p>Olivia looked puzzled. "What?"</p>
<p>I tossed the wipes package back into my trunk. "You thought about us? Me? Us having sex?"</p>
<p>Ignoring my question, she gestured to the bed. "Move over, I want to lay down."</p>
<p>Tossing aside my blankets, I scooted over to the other side and Olivia sat down beside me. I saw her pause for a moment then she reached behind her and started fumble-tugging at the silvery strings to her top.</p>
<p>"Want me to help?" I asked.</p>
<p>My sister looked back over her shoulder at me. Then, after a moment, gave me a small nod. "Sure."</p>
<p>The simple bow knot tugged free with little effort. My fingers lingered against her skin as the strings fell away. I let my hand follow that path of her spine. I diverged at her dimple and let my touch linger and ride the crest to her hip. I then gave a questioning tug on the knot of her bikini bottom.</p>
<p>"And this one?" I asked, giving it another mild tug.</p>
<p>There was a hesitant almost panicky edge to her voice. "Um, nothing else, right? Just naked. Sleeping."</p>
<p>"Sure." I tucked my pinkie finger under the knot and took it between my thumb and forefinger. Giving the silver string a slow pull, I eased out the knot and watched her bare hip appear inch by inch before my eyes.</p>
<p>"John... ."</p>
<p>"Yeah, sis?"</p>
<p>"Um, I'm a bit scared."</p>
<p>She moved just enough for the small bit of cloth to fall away. Then my sister lifted her hip to allow me to pull it out from under her. I tossed it toward my clothes bag.</p>
<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>
<p>Naked beside me, she leaned over and turned down the dial on the battery lamp. My eyes could not help but look at her bare ass the whole time till darkness hid it from my sight. I took the opportunity to slip my boxers off and send them flying after her bikini.</p>
<p>As the silence grew I asked again. "Why?"</p>
<p>"I'm buzzed. I'm horny." She moved her ass back against me till my cock pushed against the warm valley between her ass cheeks. "Badly horny. And, if I'm honest, I've kind of wanted to do something like this with you. You know, as a fantasy." My sister moved her ass just a bit, the pressure against me causing a stirring that had already been trying to grow. "So, yeah, I'm scared. Scared that I will wake up tomorrow and feel like I did what I think is not right or wrong ... but that I was just living the moment."</p>
<p>"Regrets?"</p>
<p>She nodded. I felt her soft hair brush across my nose, the scent of perfume and sweat filling my senses. "Yeah. That I will have regrets."</p>
<p>"Turn over."</p>
<p>She paused, then turned around to face me, her warm breasts pressed against my chest. I breathed in her breath. My eyes had adjusted enough by now that I could make out the curves of her face. Reaching up I pushed the hair back from her eyes. They shone in the darkness like jewels.</p>
<p>"No regrets." Leaning in, I kissed her. A passion-driven desire to taste her lips. Our bodies pressed together, a shared enjoyment of the closeness of naked skin. My sister moaned under me as I gave an instinctive thrust that drove my bare thigh across her crotch.</p>
<p>Keeping it to kissing while naked like this was possibly one of the hardest things I've done in years. I wanted to be inside her in the worst way. To do all of the things that society tells us that a brother shouldn't want to do to his sister.</p>
<p>Her nails raked my back and then she dug in her palms massaging away the ache of days.</p>
<p>Voices outside my curtain and the appearance of light brought us to a pause before we went too far. Laying there looking into each other's eyes - our mouths quivering with smiles trying to become laughter - we listened to Jim and Tim have a conversation about a party they had just come from. They were discussing going back out or going to bed. It sounded like Tim was winning the "Let's go party" argument when Linda and Bill came walking in, giggling. It wasn't too hard to tell that they were at least as drunk as myself and Olivia.</p>
<p>And apparently, they were hungry.</p>
<p>Looking down at Olivia she grinned and reached down between us. I had to keep a moan silent as her hand curled around me. She had been giving me teased gropes through my clothes for half the night but bare skin on bare ski was such a delightfully change.</p>
<p>I mouthed "Quit."</p>
<p>My sister grinned and gave me one last tug. She whispered by my ear. "I'm hungry. I'm either eating you or whatever it is that they are fixing." I had to grimace as she bit my shoulder. "Food?"</p>
<p>"Fine, fine. Cannibal."</p>
<p>Sitting up, I reached over to my bag and pulled out what I thought was a pair of my shorts till I felt the wool of the tartan.</p>
<p>"You have a kilt?" my sister asked, softly.</p>
<p>I nodded. "It was a gift years ago. I stuffed it in my bag when I saw they wear costumes here."</p>
<p>"Put it on."</p>
<p>Standing up, I wrapped the thick tartan cloth around my hips. Shivering a bit, I grabbed my vest and tossed it back on.</p>
<p>"Wow ..." My sister looked up at me and grinned. She flipped the sheet aside showing me her legs and a hint of hip. I watched her dip a hand between her legs. "You look hot, big brother."</p>
<p>Outside there was group laughter about something Tim said. I watched my sister caressing herself, my breathing growing passion fast.</p>
<p>"Food?" she said again.</p>
<p>Pushing back the curtain, I stepped out into the tent.</p>
<p>"John! Didn't know you were back." Tim gave me a friendly smile. "Oh, I love the kilt. Huba Huba."</p>
<p>Grinning back at him, I walked over to our kitchen area and dove in to help Jim throw together what was either an incredibly late dinner or an equally early breakfast. Turning on the gas grill, we threw on a couple of packs of hot dogs. Feeling more like breakfast myself, I added a few sausage links.</p>
<p>"Damn, that smells good."</p>
<p>Looking over at the door I saw Robert the bartender pirate had paused in passing. He held up a bottle of rum in each hand. "I am the bringer of libations. I am, however ... starving."</p>
<p>I gestured him inside. "Please, there is plenty."</p>
<p>Walking in, he placed the two bottles on the long table. I saw that one was a coconut rum and the other a dark spiced rum. Tim motioned towards them holding up a bottle of soda. Robert nodded, as he grabbed a plate and began to prepare a hot dog bun.</p>
<p>Olivia, dressed in washed-out gray sweatpants and a t-shirt, from my bag, joined us as the first hot dogs were coming off the grill.</p>
<p>Tim threw an arm around her shoulder. "Hey, little one. You looking a little tipsy. Hungry?"</p>
<p>My sister snapped her teeth at him. "I could eat a cow."</p>
<p>He gave her a look. "Well, I'm not sure there is any cow in these wieners. Mostly mystery meat, and MSG, but don't worry, hun. The one thing I've noticed about this little festival is an abundance of ... beef." He gave me a look.</p>
<p>Olivia looked around. "Has anyone seen Kat?"</p>
<p>"I saw her," said Linda, putting together her plate. "She was over by the hospital. Apparently, even on vacation she can't help but volunteer."</p>
<p>Tim gave a great roll of his eyes. "Oh, I am simply going to have to go over there and drag her back here before she works herself sick." He huffed. "It's the middle of the damn night, for lord's sake!"</p>
<p>From behind us came a grumpy voice. "You people have no respect for the dead."</p>
<p>Looking back, I saw Gloria. The poor girl had a blanket wrapped around her and looked incredibly pathetic. Leaving the grill, I moved over to her and tucked her under my arm, and brought her closer to the warmth of the grill. "Hungry?" I asked.</p>
<p>She gave a small pathetic nod.</p>
<p>Olivia had already made herself a plate with two hot dogs and some chips, but she handed this to Robert the Pirate and then moved over to help her inebriated friend to a chair. Olivia moved to a blue cooler and brought out what looked like a vegetable plate. My sister also got Gloria a Coke from the ice chest next to it before going back to make herself a second plate.</p>
<p>Looking around, I saw that Tim had vanished into his curtained-off area, and when he came out he was in a long robe over the blue body paint he had been wearing.</p>
<p>"Where are you going," asked Jim.</p>
<p>He picked up his goggles and a string of light. "To get Kat, and bring her back to camp."</p>
<p>Picking up my hot dog, I took the last bite. "I'll do it, Tim." I waved away Tim's argument. "I've already eaten and I need to walk off a few things. Eat, drink, and make merry. I'll be back in a bit."</p>
<p>Stopping by Olivia, I gave her a small kiss. "Be back, don't wait up."</p>
<p>"I'll keep the bed warm." She tugged on my vest as I moved away. "Hey, love you."</p>
<p>I leaned back in by her ear. "Love you too."</p>
<p>Stepping back out into the cold night, I looked back toward The Man. The whole city was alive with colored lights, like neon bright. There was still a huge party going on in that direction. Judging from the sound, like a multi-tonal thunder, there was more than just that one party still going strong. Walking over to the van, I grabbed out a heavier jacket to keep the shivers away as I walked my way over to the Rampart urgent care clinic.</p>
<p>Even in the dark, I could see it, that large red cross blazing like two huge crossed band-aids.</p>
<p>Stepping up, I saw people sitting in the chairs outside talking. One lady was slightly swaying with the distant music and she would have no doubt gotten up to dance if not for her towel-wrapped foot.</p>
<p>"There is a small wait," a guy in a red shirt told me as I headed for the door. He gestured to an empty chair.</p>
<p>I nodded that I understood, but jerked my thumb towards the door. "I've got to give a message to one of the people working inside."</p>
<p>He stood up from the bloody knee he was cleaning. "I can do it -"</p>
<p>I waved him off. "No, you're busy. I'll just poke my head in."</p>
<p>He gave a reluctant nod. Opening the yellow door, I leaned in just enough to catch the eye of a lady with a clipboard. She gave me a puzzled look.</p>
<p>"Nurse Kathrine Gillian, please?" I asked. "If she's not too busy?"</p>
<p>The lady gave me a tired smile. "She's in one of the tents behind us talking to a patient. Ask Tod out there to go run her down for you. And tell Kat I said to go get some sleep."</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>"That is pretty much why I'm here." Nodding, I went to turn back to the guy bandaging the now cleaned knee, when the night breeze shifted and the smell of the place washed out and over me.</p>
<p>Antiseptic. Sweat. A hauntingly familiar metallic smell that my brain knew came from blood.</p>
<p>The woman's expression changed from a smile to sudden concern as I began to tremble. That image vanished as I stepped back and let the door close. I was cautiously easing my way backward from the door when it opened and she peered out at me.</p>
<p>"Sir, are you okay?" she asked.</p>
<p>There was no safe air to breathe in this desert.</p>
<p>In the distance behind me, I hear the roar of cannon fire. The wind carried a hint of cordite to my nose. It chased around the smell of blood making a cocktail of distant memory I knew too well. Far too well. I hugged myself as a chill that had nothing to do with the cold desert night and more to do with a thousand ghosts hovering over my grave. All of which were gesturing for me to join them.</p>
<p>"Sir?"</p>
<p>My eyes flashed to the man in the red shirt. He rose slowly to his feet and took a half-hesitant step toward me. He stopped and held out his hands palms flat at some look he saw on my face.</p>
<p>The lady called my attention back to her. "Sir? Are you okay? Are you high?"</p>
<p>Full on trembling now, I shook my head, unable to speak. You need air to speak and to get that air I would have to breathe that smell in again. Panic was making me want to breathe in deep panting breaths but that smell was making me try and hold my breath.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>My eyes cut to what was at least a familiar face. A very tired-looking face, but familiar.</p>
<p>The roar of distant artillery fire was suddenly so very much closer. Turning towards the pop of a mortar, I reached for a gun I didn't have. The terror of that flashed through me even as the mortar shell blossomed into a huge pink and green flower of light high above us. The laughter in the darkness was oddly calming.</p>
<p>Better than the ghost screams I was hearing.</p>
<p>Kathrine -- all exhaustion gone from her eyes - shot the guy in red a quick pointed finger. Her eyes never left me."Tod, run and tell those guys to move their fireworks elsewhere. They are disturbing the patients." She took a hesitant step toward me. "John? It's me, John, you know me. Nurse Gillian, remember?"</p>
<p>"Kathrine," I corrected, softly.</p>
<p>"That's right. Kathrine." She edged a little closer. "Know where you are, John?"</p>
<p>Closing my eyes, I took a too-deep smell of the burned gunpowder, antiseptic, and that metallic-bloody- noxious air. "At Burning Man. I'm okay."</p>
<p>"No, you are not." She moved closer. "John?"</p>
<p>I flinched back from her. The hospital smell clung to her clothes, her skin, her hair. "It's the smell. I shouldn't have come here. I should have thought ..." I looked around. It was too bright here by this red sign, The snipers... damn it John there are no snipers. Calm down. Calm down... "I shouldn't have come."</p>
<p>She nodded. "I understand. I do. Let me clean up, and I'll walk back to camp with you, John. I was just about to leave."</p>
<p>"We fixed a late dinner." I kept up my zone checking. My eyes flicked from place to place looking for quick movement or shadows that shouldn't be there. "Just hot dogs, but we cooked plenty."</p>
<p>"Sounds good, I'm hungry." Her eyes cut over to the other lady. "Mary, keep my friend John here company while I clean up. He had a few rough years and the memories have ... lingered."</p>
<p>The woman, who I had first spoken to nodded. "I understand. My brother had the same problem. John, would you like to have a seat?" She gestured towards the plastic waiting chairs.</p>
<p>I shook my head. Too close. Far far too close to that door.</p>
<p>"The AO is clear."</p>
<p>Turning, I saw the older man I had met at the Temple on my first day here. He was walking up to me slowly. He gave me a smile.</p>
<p>"The AO is clear, trust me. I was downrange. Outside the wire. I check it, brother, it's clear."</p>
<p>Slowly, I stood up from the crouch I had automatically assumed. Looking down, I saw that my right hand was holding a ghost gun that didn't exist. The short panting breaths I didn't know I was taking slow.</p>
<p>"I'm Leo," he said after a moment. "Remember me?"</p>
<p>Calming a bit, I nodded. "I'm John."</p>
<p>"Need help back to your camp, John?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I've got him, Leo."</p>
<p>Walking up beside us, I saw that Kathrine had taken a quick wash and was wearing different clothes. Even at this distance, I could tell she smelled of cheap rose perfume, lemon dish soap, and rubbing alcohol. She gave me a calming smile.</p>
<p>"He one of yours, Kat?" He gave her a welcome smile. "I know he is in good hands then. John, here went through hell, He needs good people around him to guide him back when his mind strays back there."</p>
<p>Kathrine had moved close enough to me that she reached out a hesitant hand and tugged my jacket's sleeve in the direction of our camp. She gave me a smile. "John and I are old ... friends. We're camped together. I'll get him home."</p>
<p>Absently wiping sweat from my brow, I let her turn me towards camp. Her hand on my elbow guided me. We had only taken a few steps when Leo's gravelly voice rang out behind me.</p>
<p>"Hey, John?"</p>
<p>Turning, my head I looked over my shoulder at him. "Yes, sir?"</p>
<p>He gave me a tired smile. "Come to the Temple tomorrow. When the sun goes down. A few of us are gathering there."</p>
<p>I gave a hesitant nod.</p>
<p>Kathrine spoke up beside me. "I'll bring him. Goodnight, Leo."</p>
<p>He gave a haunted chuckle. "It's a night, Kat. You have a good one though. See you tomorrow."</p>
<p>Obeying the tug at my arm, I began to walk in a kind of mindless daze. The day's work, followed by the night of dancing had me now feeling exhausted. But even as tired as I was, my eyes darted to each tent as we passed it. I watched longest the ones where people were standing around drinking and laughing. There was an envy within me for their innocent laughter.</p>
<p>"Good days and bad, huh John?"</p>
<p>Looking at her upturned face, I gave a hesitant nod. "Good and bad." I looked around at the brilliantly</p>
<p>lit Black Rock City sprawled here in the desert and sighed. "Not this bad too often."</p>
<p>"Lots of triggers here," She slipped her arm into mine. "Lots of distractions from them here too. Find those. Focus on them."</p>
<p>"I remember," I had to work to keep the snarl out of my voice. "Not sure I will ever forget that mantra."</p>
<p>She gave a non-apologetic shrug. "That's why we drilled it into you so hard. But, to be honest, I didn't do it just for you vets. I mostly did it for myself."</p>
<p>I gave her an odd look.</p>
<p>Kathrine looked up at the night sky. "I got tired of hearing that people I tried to help took their own lives just weeks out of my care. I went to way too many funerals." She stopped and gave me a stern look. "So I decided to make you grunts get your shit together."</p>
<p>"It's not that easy."</p>
<p>She nodded. "Oh, I know it's not. Doesn't make it unimportant to remember that you can do it though. That trying is doing." She stopped us a dozen feet short of the Bedouin. "John, you were one of the easy ones. The type of veteran that I knew would make it for the long haul." Kathrine placed a hand on my chest. "Independent. Tough as nails. With a good strong heart." Her flat palm became a pointing finger. "Don't you damn well dare ever make a liar out of me."</p>
<p>I grinned. My hand lifted to my brow and I gave her a lazy salute. " Yes, sir, Nurse Gillian, sir."</p>
<p>She smirked. "Asshole."</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>
<p>From within my lighted tent came a burst of laughter. I could make out Tim's voice and my sister's.</p>
<p>With one last threatening point of her finger, she turned and walked toward the Bedouin.</p>
<p>"Hey, Kat?" I called after her.</p>
<p>She turned back to me suddenly.</p>
<p>"Thanks." I gave a small shrug. "For everything. Back then. And now."</p>
<p>She gave me a small smile. The tired look was back in her eyes. "Better now, John?"</p>
<p>I nodded. "Yeah."</p>
<p>"Good." Her head tilted. "Stay that way."</p>
<p>I nodded, even as I hid my grin. "I'll try. Maybe if you were topless more often it would help. Focus on distractions, right?"</p>
<p>Kat gave me a low throaty chuckle. "Don't flirt with me, John. I'm old enough to be your mother, and I don't have time in my life to properly train up another man-child to adulthood." She waited till I got beside her and linked arms with me again. "Besides, I'm into Klingon sex. Not sure you would survive me, little man."</p>
<p>I tightened my arm on hers possessively. "Oh, I don't know. Tough as nails. With a good strong heart."</p>
<p>"Oh, shut up."</p>
<p>As we walked through the door of the tent, we both stopped in our tracks. My sister and Gloria had gotten into the body paints and were busy painting dark stripes and white dots on the already blue body of a once again naked Tim.</p>
<p>Seeing us, he struck a pose. "Welcome to Pandora. I 'see' you, John-sully!"</p>
<p>Such a long week. Such a very long week.</p>
<p>(Day 4)</p>
<p>After so late and exhausting a night that I slept in can be forgiven.</p>
<p>Slowly opening my eyes, I found my vision filled with hair. Moving slowly I looked down at my sister's face. Her nose was blue from where Tim had brushed it with body paint. Smiling, I brushed a strand of loose brown hair from her face. I let my gaze drift down her. As the morning heat had begun to rise she had tossed off the red Indian blanket and then the sheet leaving her bare to my eyes from belly button up.</p>
<p>How have we come to this point?</p>
<p>That I was sleeping night after night next to my naked sister was staggering to my mind. Exactly how many times I had kissed Olivia - kissed my sister, the most annoying brat of my teen existence - in the last few days was also a mind-boggling fact. That I wanted to kiss her again. Now! And to do a lot more than kiss.</p>
<p>She smiled, her eyes closed, then whispered. "You're staring, John." Her eyes fluttered open. "Enjoying the view? What are you thinking about?"</p>
<p>"Kissing you."</p>
<p>Olivia wiggled closer to me and I turned till I was leaning over her face, looking down.</p>
<p>"That might not be the best idea this morning." My sister moved her tongue over her pink lips. "My mouth tastes terrible even to me." Her hands ran down my side then across my back pulling me closer. Her chin ran along mine and she placed a soft kiss in the bristle by my ear. Softly, she whispered. "But I wouldn't say no to just about anything else you have in mind ... except, I need to go pee. Sorry."</p>
<p>I began to laugh as she wiggled her way out from under me and all but fell out of bed. I watched Olivia scamper around the partitioned-off space, naked, to gather clothes.</p>
<p>"Landing strip, huh?"</p>
<p>My sister shot me a look even as she pulled up her shorts. She turned around. "Shut. Up."</p>
<p>"Nice ass, sis."</p>
<p>"Shut up!"</p>
<p>I was chuckling still as she shot out the door. I heard a couple of the others saying good morning to my sister as she rushed out of the tent to run toward the closest port-a-let.</p>
<p>Sitting up on the side of the bed I ran my hands over my head, massaging a sore crick in my neck. Almost mechanically I took a wet wipe from the pouch by the bed and removed yet another layer of dust from my face. I'm pretty sure by now there are three layers that will be there for months to come no matter how much I showered.</p>
<p>Closing my eyes, I sat for a moment fantasizing about standing in my shower and letting water just pour over me. It was almost orgasmic when I added soap to the fantasy.</p>
<p>Standing up, I applied the second and third wipes to more strategic areas. It was a futile effort to get clean but I felt at least a bit better. Digging out a clean dark gray tank top, and a pair of long tan cargo pants, I dug another of my Shemagh desert scarves out and looped it over my head as a hood, wrapping the excess around my neck and shoulders. As I slipped on my shoes I noticed my feet hurt.</p>
<p>Sitting back down on my bed I fell back on old military training and examined my feet. The alkaline dust of this lake bed I saw almost instantly was starting to take a toll. Not yet to the point of cracking and bleeding but not too far from that either.</p>
<p>Getting up, I stepped out into the main tent.</p>
<p>"Morning, John. Want some coffee?" Jim pointed to a cardboard half-box full of cups. "You forgot about the ice yesterday, so Bill and I pedaled out there this morning and bought a couple of bags and I grabbed some fresh coffee while I was there."</p>
<p>"Sorry, about that. I'll go tomorrow." I picked up a cup. It was half cold, overly sweetened and creamed but it was good. "Thanks for this. Um, pass it along to everyone to check their feet." I tapped my foot on the carpet and a puff of dust fore. "This powdery shit can make them crack and bleed."</p>
<p>Jim nodded. "I remember reading about that, but yeah it's slipped my mind in all the bustle. I'll pass it on."</p>
<p>My sister came walking back in, gave me a look, and vanished into her partition.</p>
<p>"Everyone else gone out already?" I asked.</p>
<p>Jim shook his head. "A few are still sleeping it off. Linda, Kat, and Gloria. Tim went to get some pictures of himself as a Na'vi on some of the art pieces. And Bill went with him to take them." He took the last sip of his coffee. "Me, I've never been to bed yet, so ... I'm going to wander over to one of the blue Turdis, discharge my sonic screwdriver, and then hit the sack. It's going to be one long night, I'm sure. The later the week goes the more the parties grow. Or so I've been told."</p>
<p>When he left, I stepped back into my bedroom and grabbed a bottle of lotion. Walking over to my sister's partition I poked my head inside. She was sitting on her bed looking down at her hands. Moving to her I knelt down. She looked up at me and tried for a smile.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" I asked.</p>
<p>She massaged her fingers. "It's getting out of hand. Me and you."</p>
<p>I sat down on the floor by her feet. I looked up at her face. "How so?" Putting a dab of lotion in my palm I absently lifted her foot by the heel and began to gently massage the cool cream into her skin.</p>
<p>"Sleeping naked in your arms? Willing to have sex with you? While cold sober?" She let out a soft chuckle. "Take your pick of the three. I mean when I was drunk at least I could say it was the alcohol but this morning?" She moaned. "That feels so good."</p>
<p>Smiling, I applied a bit more of the lotion. "I love you. I want you."</p>
<p>Her head snapped up, her eyes wide open. "We can't!"</p>
<p>"Then we don't." I shrugged and moved to her other foot. "Doesn't mean I don't want to, just that we don't do it."</p>
<p>She was silent for a long moment. "I want to as well."</p>
<p>I moved my hand off her foot and up the back of her calve muscle. "If you are expecting me to be the strong moral one here, sis, I wouldn't." The back of her knee was warm and moist under my fingers. "It's been more than a little while since I've held and touched a woman who I felt anything emotionally for. When it comes to you, I feel like I'm drowning and I need you to save me. And to be honest it's taking all my self-control not to be kissing you right now."</p>
<p>Leaning in, I kissed her knee. The scent of her skin filled my nose. Her hand came to rest on the top of my head. I placed a second kiss on the side of her knee. Her fingers tightened in my hair.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>Placing a third kiss on her inner thigh, just behind the knee, I looked up at her. She was breathing in short soft pants.</p>
<p>"Let's just keep it ... normal ... for today."</p>
<p>With a reluctant nod, I rolled up off my knees. "Sure, sis." Turning, I paused at the cloth flap. "Jim got coffee. It's cold but good."</p>
<p>"John ... I .. um, I'm ..sor--"</p>
<p>I shook my head cutting her off. "Don't be. It's this place. It's me as much as you." I paused for a moment my hand on the cloth partition. "After last night, I have a few things I need to work out. I'll be back. Going to go take a long walk. Alone."</p>
<p>She gave me a small nod.</p>
<p>Walking back to my side of the tent, I grabbed the keys to the van out of my boot and went outside in the growing heat. Popping open the door, I dug under the seat for the Ziploc bag hidden in the zigzag metal springs. Holding it, I looked at the small dark slices of mushroom. One of the few painkillers that really works a hundred percent for me I chewed one then a second. I fished my tennis shoes out of the space between the seat and slipped them on.</p>
<p>Taking a bottle of water to sip on, I left our camp and walked my way out to the orange perimeter fence. Stretching as I went, I was limbered up by the time the ever-present pain in my hip had vanished. Stuffing the half-full plastic bottle into one of my cargo pockets, I started walking.</p>
<p>Then jogging.</p>
<p>Then running.</p>
<p>With the mushroom now full in effect I felt as if my feet were all but hovering above the ground. Any worry I might have had became a distant and unconcerned thing. I wanted that distance. Craved it. Beside me the orange fence became a glowing bar, vanishing into the distance.</p>
<p>How many years had it been since I had done morning PT? I knew but didn't care that my hip would be telling me exactly how many years later. To the second how many. But for now, I needed this run. To hell with that future pain. Deal with it then.</p>
<p>As the heat built the warmth of the desert began to bake me and the rush of the air past me became a huge hairdryer effect against my face. I relished this heat.</p>
<p>Passing the greeter station, I saw that there were still cars coming in. Madness. I understood it now though, here in this special place. People would arrive and arrive and arrive till this city could hold no more. It was like drinking tequila. You just keep doing the shots till your stomach goes "No More!" and you vomit it all back out. Black Rock City was the same. Even as we were trying to depart on Sunday there would still be people just arriving.</p>
<p>In a haze where everything made sense and nothing mattered I ran. I ran the orange fence. I ran the playa. I ran till minutes became an hour. I ran till the drug began to fade and - sobering - I realized that, no matter how far I went, I could never escape. I was trying to run from something inside me! The demon of temptation that was telling me that anything I wanted to do was okay. Drink myself plastered? Sure, bottoms up, John. Sex with Olivia? Sure, it will be fun. With Olivia and Gloria? Why the hell not! Load up my service issue Beretta the next time I'm depressed...</p>
<p>Stopping, sweat trying to pour out of me but mostly running trails down the white powder dust covering me, I leaned over and panted for breath. Looking back towards the circular city, I saw that I was about even with the Temple.</p>
<p>"This was stupid John," I said to myself looking up at the bright sun in the blue summer sky. "Par for course, huh, dumb ass?"</p>
<p>Walking now, limping with each step, I headed towards the Temple, still a good distance away from me.</p>
<p>My hip had begun to hurt again.</p>
<p>I was gifted a small rug made from woven rags. It was thick, super soft, and at least it kept my butt up off of the Temple floor.</p>
<p>When I finally limped my way into the Temple I found it to be the welcoming cool quiet place that I was needing at that moment. Someone was playing soft music on a flute, there were whispered voices, and the occasional sound of grief but all sound was muted. I eased myself down, slowly sipping a bottle of water that I was given. Sitting, resting, listening I looked upon the many words of memory and sorrow written on the wooden walls around me.</p>
<p>A part of me wanted to leave a few of my own. Words spoken to the past, whispers left in ink for the lost souls of friends.</p>
<p>A part of me didn't.</p>
<p>Those memories were mine! Kept close to my heart, held there to warm me. Their laughter and joy mixed hand in hand with the memories of loss and pain. Times best left forgotten, but that can never be forgotten.</p>
<p>I must have been looking particularly pathetic. A young woman came over and knelt down beside me. After a moment she hugged me and wished me well.</p>

<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>After she left I began to think of that and a slow sense of amazement began to fill me. Here I was a complete stranger, dressed in dusty and ragged clothes, looking for all of the world like a homeless man dusted in flour, and she hadn't hesitated to hug me. If I had been walking down a city street and seen someone looking like me sitting propped against a building I would have looked away lest they ask me for money.</p>
<p>That such would have been my reaction also made me think and I didn't like those thoughts much.</p>
<p>The day passed. The number and nature of the people that came here to the Temple changed throughout the day. At times it felt like I was too old and battered to be around all these young and far too pretty people. Then, at other times, I would be the fresh-faced, first-playa-dust-behind-the-ears, youth amid ancient-looking hippies.</p>
<p>Admittedly, they were the more fun of the two groups.</p>
<p>I must have sat for two hours listening to two old fellows reminiscing about the long weekend they spent at the "Sleeze Lake Resort" back in seventy-seven, and the hilarity of an event that was planned for about eight hundred custom hot rod vans, but which had received closer to seven thousand. They apparently wiped out the neighboring town of food, alcohol, and all manner of toiletries. One of them swore there wasn't a box of condoms for sale within thirty miles that didn't get bought over those few days of fun and music. Twenty thousand people and no cops. If it could happen, in a small city where half the people were drunk, it happened.</p>
<p>After they wandered away, I sat and thought and then I sat and thought some more.</p>
<p>Mostly I watched people.</p>
<p>Okay, women.</p>
<p>I suppose, if there is a place for people to want to take off as much clothing as possible, the middle of a desert is a pretty good choice. As the sun rose and crested over that glaring white desert, the amount of cloth people wore got smaller and smaller till at last it seemed to just vanish. Now in some cases that was not a good thing. I saw a few naked bodies that day that will linger in my memory for far too many years to come. But then life in the military took away most of my own modesty and all of my curiosity about the human body. Well, at least the male half of our species.</p>
<p>"Hello, stranger."</p>
<p>Looking up, I smiled seeing my sister walking in. Looking past her I saw her pink horror of a bicycle setting among a cluster of similar eye-screaming colors.</p>
<p>"Oh, this is nice." She sat down on the rug next to me. I made room for her. "Are you doing okay? You scared me a bit when you just vanished like that and didn't come back."</p>
<p>"Sorry." I gave a small shrug. "I came here. Been sitting and just thinking." I looked around at the wooden Temple. "I needed to be by myself here for a bit."</p>
<p>She leaned into me. "I'm sorry I dragged you out here to this place, John."</p>
<p>I shook my head. "I'm not. This has been one of the more interesting weeks I've ever had." I leaned in by her ear. "And not just because I got to see my sister naked."</p>
<p>"And feel her up!" Olivia, had the decency to blush even as she grinned. "And have her feel you up." With a laugh, she bumped my side. "I'm glad you are here with me. You're like the anchor that's keeping me from being blown away into the dust storms. The others feel the same."</p>
<p>I shook my head. "It's not like I've done much, so far. Provided the tent and shown a few newbie campers how not to burn the campsite down is about it."</p>
<p>She pointed across the playa to where the tall wooden version of the Eiffel Tower stood. "Kimberly has already said that she wants you back here next year."</p>
<p>"That was fun. To be honest, I'm going to hate to see it burn."</p>
<p>My sister linked her arm into mine. "But think how big a fire that will make. And where would you put it if it wasn't burned? You can't exactly have a hundred-foot wooden tower in the backyard. Or would it be better if it was sold to some corporate suit who would use it to peddle whatever crap they sell?" She shook her head. "It's art! Art should be enjoyed." Olivia waved her hand at the Temple. "Like this is." She hugged my arm tight. "I love this place. It's crazy! I mean at times I feel like I'm in a video game. It's all dusty white all day then at night it's a thousand colors and a blaze of a million lights. It's magical!"</p>
<p>"But that magic has to come to an end."</p>
<p>We both looked up as Kat knelt down beside us.</p>
<p>"Why?" asked Olivia.</p>
<p>She looked at me and smiled. "He knows."</p>
<p>My sister looked over at me, puzzled. "So? Why?"</p>
<p>At first, I wasn't sure exactly how she meant it, but then it came to me. Reaching over, I placed my hand on one of the many written prayers for a lost loved one. "The magic of this place is not that it's fun, but that it reflects. It's like a fun house mirror showing you your own face faceted from a hundred directions. But if it lasted too long you would start to feel trapped in it till madness took you."</p>
<p>My sister looked at me her mouth dropping into a perfect O of surprise. "Wow. That is profound, big brother.</p>
<p>Looking down at the dust on my hand, I shook my head.</p>
<p>Kat explained it. "It's how a lot of vets describe their time in war."</p>
<p>Olivia shook her head. "I don't understand."</p>
<p>I was about to try and describe to my sister what I meant when I saw Leo and a few other guys that had the ex-military look about them pull up in an art car. They took out big coolers and placed them in a large circle.</p>
<p>"Those guys over there do." I sighed. "Help me up, you two. Please?"</p>
<p>Olivia and Kat got me to my feet. I rolled up my little rug and tucked it under my arm. Olivia ducked under my other arm and acted as a crutch as I limped my way toward that circle.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" she asked.</p>
<p>I nodded. "Jared my hip. I'm good, just stiff and sore."</p>
<p>As I walked up I was greeted like a brother. A half dozen hugs and a cold beer. Too many names to remember and half of them were nicknames to begin with. We watched the Sun sinking in a golden-to-red gradient that blurred to purple and then starry black. In the distance, the thunder of bass drums began to sound and the million lights of Black Rock City appeared to try and rival the stars.</p>
<p>A short bearded guy who had introduced himself as "Duck-fucker" stood up.</p>
<p>"I was US Army. OEF VII Veteran. Afghanistan, two thousand six and seven. Did a sixteen-month deployment, we got extended after being there a year. Was set to rotate back on my birthday. Yeah! Beat that shit, huh. Week out, I took two in the chest from an Ali Baba sniper." He touched two places on his broad hairy chest, rubbing at the one nearest his shoulder. "My OTV caught most of one, the other shattered my collarbone and rattled around as it went out my back. I lost most of my right lung. I was medically retired."</p>
<p>When he sat down another man stood up with the help of a cane. He leaned on it as he spoke about his two bloody tours in Iraq.</p>
<p>After him was Leo, and I winced in sympathy more than once as he talked about the First and Second battle of Fallujah. About the close friends he lost in the first and the hideous wounds, he himself took in the second. He told of them with a calm acceptance that I had heard far too many times. Men telling of the simple facts, not the days of intense pain they had lived through. And, in many cases, still lived through.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>I looked up at Kathrine. She was standing looking down at me, shadowed against the night sky, haloed by stars. She offered me a hand.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, I took it and let her pull me up on my aching hip. I caught my balance and wished I had one of my walking sticks.</p>
<p>Looking around, I faced these men who sat like shadowy ghosts from my past.</p>
<p>"I'm John Quigley. I was with the Tenth Mountain Division, at Korengal Valley. We ran patrols for a few months, then I was on station there for about four months kind of tied to our HLZ. It was the only viable one we had." I waved my hand in a what can you do kind of way. "We were waiting for a resupply, then we were going to move the patrol base. We got hit that night right at dark, right at stand to."</p>
<p>I looked up. It was almost to the second this exact same time come to think of it.</p>
<p>"We had a fairly good position on a low ridge line. They got in close. It rained RPG, we were tossing hand grenades. They brought everyone they could get to show up and tried to run us over. They got into machine gun range, we drove them back. They tried again. Our lieutenant got caught moving between positions and an RPG hit the tree he was behind, wounding him. I tried to make it to him and I caught my own shrapnel bath." I ached in a half dozen places even at the mention of those old wounds. "I had about a quarter-pound of metal in my hip bone. Two bleeders in my side and a half dozen stingers in my back and leg. I couldn't walk, so I hunkered down behind a rock -- bleeding like hell, trying to stuff a bandage in me -- all the while bullets buzzed past me. Chipping the rocks by my face. I was expecting the whole time we were about to be overrun. Even when they pulled back at last I just 'knew' they were coming back." I swallowed down the shakes that wanted to take me. "If they had come right then, we would have not made it out." With a shrug, I looked up at the sky above and the blazing river of bright stars appearing. "I got carried to the MedEvac by two good buddies of mine. They put me beside the Lieutenant, he was bleeding out of his ears from concussion." I chuckled. "He was pissed as hell that the medic was trying to fly him out. The Platoon Sargent told him off, but he got his way and stayed. Me they flew out."</p>
<p>"As they should." The guy with a cane pointed it at me. "You were a liability with a hip wound."</p>
<p>I nodded, chewing that bitter pill. "I know. It was just that ... well, I didn't feel like I had earned it."</p>
<p>Several of these old vets nodded understanding how that feels.</p>
<p>"Honestly, if I hadn't been drugged loopy at that point, I would have tried to get up and get back in position. How could I just ... leave?"</p>
<p>I swayed on my feet for a moment and Kat caught my arm. I looked at her surprised, to be honest at that moment I had half-forgotten that she was here.</p>
<p>"I knew that they were coming back. They had come at us with such numbers, they had to be coming back. And they did. But the Lieutenant had managed to set up an ambush patrol, they got them when they tried to sneak back in." I shrugged. "I didn't know. I passed out from blood loss on the chopper, woke up three days later at Bagram Airfield with twenty-nine stitches, fifteen staples, a new metal cap on my hip bone, a fractured pelvis, and ... a medical ticket back into civilian clothing."</p>
<p>I looked around at the shadowed faces. With a nod to them all, I turned and walked with my sister back to where she had spread out my rug. She helped me ease my way back down.</p>
<p>Kat now stood alone now in the middle of us. Sitting there with Olivia holding me, we listened to her.</p>
<p>"I always wanted to be a doctor. To work in a big hospital." She chuckled. "I wanted to be the one who got famous for finding miracle cures to everything. But I couldn't afford the cost of medical school to make that dream happen. So ... I became a physician assistant. That I could afford at least." She took a sip of her beer. "After I got my training, I ended up kicking around for a couple of years, trying different things. Somehow I ended up working with a Dr. Kent. He dealt mostly with military trauma recovery, PTSD, alcohol and drug abuse, um ... and attempted suicides by veterans."</p>
<p>Squatting down Kat picked up a handful of playa dust and when she stood up began to let it fall between her fingers.</p>
<p>"I hated it. In four months I saw more people leave us and then take their own lives than anyone should have to see. I was about to quit when a young guy came in. Andy. Barely twenty. He had been shot in the face ... lost a lot of bone and his left eye." Her voice dropped to a whisper we all heard. "Maimed. He was just a kid, had barely had a life and now Andy couldn't stand to even look in a mirror. All he wanted to do was die. Drink himself to death, overdose, or maybe use a second bullet to finish what the first had started ... he didn't care. He just wanted out."</p>
<p>Several of us were nodding. We all knew that want. Knew it bad.</p>
<p>"I got mad. He wouldn't listen to Dr. Kent but I was going to damn well make him listen to me." Her voice held a familiar snarl. "I didn't really plan it out, but I guess I decided if a soft touch wouldn't work then maybe tough love could. I was cruel. I was mean. I made him hate me. I made him hate me till he was so mad at me he forgot to even think about wanting to die and - by the end of rehab - he would have chewed barbwire to spite me and show me that he could live. And he did." She gave a small chuckle. "I get a Christmas card from him now every year."</p>
<p>I watched her wipe away a tear.</p>
<p>"Andy was the first I can really say that I saved. Since then I've lost count how many I've seen give up, but I know ... I damn well know that there are one hundred and seven veterans that I have made straighten their asses up, take back their lives, and get back on their feet. I love every one of them. " Kat made a choked-up sound that was half chuckle and half pain. "And yeah, I hate myself at times for what I did ... but I damn well know I would do it a dozen times over if I could have saved even one more ... one more who I didn't manage to save."</p>
<p>Olivia got to her feet and rushed to Kat, wrapping her up in a tight hug. I would have joined them, but my leg didn't want to work. As is the best I could do was sit there and silently thank her ...</p>
<p>... cause I damn well know I'm one of those hundred and seven.</p>
<p>My sister and I rode an art car back to our camp. My morning PT stupidity had me about at the level of a cripple. I had my sister go grab me one of my walking sticks just so I could manage to hobble from the car to my bed. I chased six ibuprofen with vanilla moonshine, which is I'm sure medically advised for pain management. Olivia and I were the only ones in the Bedouin, the others out partying I'm willing to bet.</p>
<p>She fixed us some food, then sat beside me on my bed as we ate. But, pretty much the whole time we ate she would look at my face. I tried to avoid meeting that gaze as much as I could. When the food was gone she took the flask of moonshine from me and took a large sip.</p>
<p>"John, why do I seem to hear about my brother's life always second hand?"</p>
<p>I took the flask back from her, tipped a small sip between my lips, and capped it. "Sorry."</p>
<p>"That's all I get? You're sorry?" Reaching over she picked up a pillow and tried to whack me with it. Dust flew as I blocked it. She waved it away. "Damn dust! It's fucking everywhere!"</p>
<p>"Yep." Patting the bed beside me, I raised a small cloud.</p>
<p>My sister grabbed my shirt and made me face her. "No more of it, John. No more. No more secrets. No more secrets by omission. I want to damn well know when things are going on with you!" She turned me loose and pointed in the general direction of East. "And you can let Mom and Dad know to keep me clued in as well! Understood?"</p>
<p>Reaching up, I moved her arm a bit more to the north to have her point, more or less, toward our parent's house. She yanked it out of my fingers and pointed at my face. Leaning forward, I kissed the tip.</p>
<p>"I'll try," I promised.</p>
<p>Her pretty lips quirked. "You'll try, huh?"</p>
<p>"Yep, best I can do."</p>
<p>With a shake of her head, Olivia stood up, grabbed our plates, and carried them back out to the kitchen area. After a few moments, she came back into my room, reached up, and turned down the wick till the lantern guttered out. Watching her dark silhouette, I saw her pull off first her shirt and then slip out of her shorts.</p>
<p>"I want a nap, then I want to go party. Budge over."</p>
<p>Moving a bit, I felt her naked body slide in next to me. I winced as she gave me a poke in the side.</p>
<p>"Your clothes are dusty and these sheets are cold. Help me warm them up."</p>
<p>Not bothering with trying to stand back up, I slipped my cargo pants off, then tossed them and my shirt toward the bag of my dirty clothes. Turning, I slipped under the sheets behind her. Olivia was right, the bed was cool to the point of being cold. My sister's ass pressed back against me and by comparison, she was hot as fire. We snuggled in together, with me shifting a blanket over us. She took my arm and held it pressed closer to her belly. I could feel the warm soft weight of her breasts alongside my arm...</p>
<p>Burying my nose in the hair at the nape of her neck, I could smell the effects of these last few grungy days of sweat and dust, but under that was the wonderful scent of a woman's skin.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, sis?"</p>
<p>"I wish I had known you were hurt so badly." She hugged my arm tighter. "I wish I could have been there to help you recover. I wish I had known that you were having so much trouble. I never had a clue. All I've ever done is ask you to do things for me." Olivia turned a little towards me. "You were right, I don't ever call you unless I want something from you. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Half asleep, I chuckled lightly. "It's alright, sis."</p>
<p>Her hair brushed my nose as she shook her head. "No, it's not alright. Being here, in this place, where you have to do for yourself so much has made me come to realize just how much I use the people I know. You, Mom and Dad, my friends. And most of the time I never even ask if they mind, I just assume that they will be happy to give me whatever I ask for." She gave a sniffle. "How narcissistic is that crap, right?"</p>
<p>"Sis, stop worrying about it and go to sleep." I took a deep breath. "We all love you."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>Holding her tight to me I tried to find the words. "Mostly because we just do, but if you want specifics I guess a lot of us envy you."</p>
<p>She twisted in my arms to face me. "You what? Me?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>She snuggled in by my chest. "Why in the hell would you envy me? I'm an emotional mess."</p>
<p>I ran my hand along her smooth back. "But you're Teflon girl. Nothing seems to stick. You can be sad, unhappy, mad as hell, and then just suddenly full of energy and ready to bounce off the wall all in a few minutes." I gave a small chuckle. "I guess we all love you because we wish we could be like that. When something goes wrong for me it takes me hours to get past it."</p>
<p>My sister shook her head. "No, I do the same thing."</p>
<p>"Well, you sure hide it damn well."</p>
<p>She leaned back and lay her head on my pillow. "I guess I just run away from what bothers me and try to distract myself so I don't get depressed. That's not even close to hiding it."</p>
<p>Looking down at her face, I smiled seeing her quirky smile. I couldn't help myself, I leaned in and kissed her. A simple peck kind of kiss. Olivia grinned and kissed me back.</p>
<p>"Eww, you kissed your sister!" she whispered by my ear.</p>
<p>I moved a bit till I was supporting myself on my elbow, hovering over her. "Well, if she wasn't my sister the naked lady in my arms would be getting a lot more than kissed."</p>
<p>Her expression became more serious.</p>
<p>My sister placed her hand on my bare chest. "We have teased and teased each other this week, but I do have to ask. Would you? Would you really want to have sex with me?" Her hand moved down my side then under me taking hold of my cock. "I can feel that this wants me, and if you were to reach between my legs you would find me wet and ready for it, but ... really?" After a bit too hard of a squeeze that made me wince, she grinned. "All I can think right now is of all the times when you and I were at each other's throats, as children. The tickling. The hidden punches Mom and Dad didn't see. Pranks played. Often evil pranks that really hurt."</p>
<p>I shrugged and moved to lie on my back next to her. "Sorry about those, but in my defense I was getting as good as I gave."</p>

<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>"Oh, I know. I'm in no way denying that I was a full-on brat to you." Now it was her turn to prop herself up above me and look down at my face. "I guess what I'm asking is when did the desire to have sex begin? I know for me it's years ago. Right out of high school."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>She nodded. "When I saw you in uniform. You looked so incredible. Then we went to the beach and you were in those dull green shorts. All muscles, sweat, and smiles." Her hand traced my chest and the firm muscle of my abdomen. "Before you vanished off overseas every friend I had was asking me about you. They all wanted to throw themselves onto your bed and drag you in after them."</p>
<p>An Army tank division could not have gotten out of me at that moment that a couple of them had done that very thing. Giving a noncommittal shrug, I turned over to the small table by my bed and picked up the bottle of bourbon. Sitting up, I took a small sip, then offered her some. Olivia shook her head and turned away.</p>
<p>"Then you vanished out of my life."</p>
<p>Setting the bottle down by the bed, I turned to face her and placed a hand on her hip. Laying on my side like this hurt my hip, but I ignored the pain.</p>
<p>"Sorry if that hurt you. I joined the Army to learn who I was as a man. Our Uncle Sam thought there was a problem over there that needed solved and that I could ... should ... do my part." I let my hand glide over her bare thigh. "Looking back over it now, I can see now that I swallowed a load of bunk handed to me by politicians with a monetary interest in that region. We went there to help people under the foot of terrorists and all we really did for all our blood and pain was make a bunch of millionaires into billionaires."</p>
<p>Olivia looked back over her shoulder at me. "I didn't know you were bitter about the war."</p>
<p>The sigh came up from my soul. "I've never met a soldier who wasn't a little bitter about the war he was in. We love our brothers in uniform, we love the service, but we one and all feel used by the government once it's all said and done." Pulling myself up off my aching hip, I took another swig of the bourbon. "For me, even being injured and losing friends wasn't the worse part. It was watching the news of us pulling out. Leaving all those pieces of equipment for the Taliban. After decades of bloody work to just hand them the place we had fought so hard to help. To arm them better than they had ever been." I chewed the whiskey and dust in my mouth, feeling the grit on my teeth. "To see the news footage taken since then ... . It's disgusting to see them waving American-made guns in places where I once walked and fought."</p>
<p>My sister turned herself over and looked up at me. My eyes went to her breasts and the dark nipples perched atop. She gave a small smile and then tugged the blanket up higher covering herself.</p>
<p>"Sorry. I don't know too much about it." Olivia gave a small shrug that made her left nipple reappear. "I've heard Dad thundering about it and Mom tried to explain it to me, but I wasn't too interested. A bunch of Boomer political nonsense and the normal warmongering crap from Washington."</p>
<p>I gave a small chuckle. "How the two of us could be so different, while raised by the same parents, I'll never understand."</p>
<p>Olivia returned me a quirky grin. "There just always seems to be more important things to worry about than who is doing what to whom in some faraway land, I'll never go to. We should never have been there, to begin with. We spent a ton of money that could have been put to much better use elsewhere. And yeah, a lot of guys like you got hurt or killed, and for what? Like you said, the bad guys are now stronger than they were when we went over there."</p>
<p>I winced at the distant sound of fireworks.</p>
<p>When I looked up my sister was looking at me with a hint of pity.</p>
<p>"Can I help?" she asked.</p>
<p>After a moment I shook my head. "Not in any way that I can think of. It comes and goes. Most days I'm good. Normal, normal. Then a car backfires behind me and I'm two thousand miles away sitting behind a Hesco with my heart pounding out of my chest."</p>
<p>She gave me a look. "A Hesco?"</p>
<p>Chuckling, I took a small sip. "It's a big type of sandbag."</p>
<p>Olivia nodded. "Sounds like a good place to hide. Lay flat."</p>
<p>I gave her an odd look of my own. "Not unless the shooting was really heavy. You need to be able to move if mortars round start coming your way."</p>
<p>My sister laughed and pointed at the bed beside her. "No, lay down ... here. Flat. On your stomach."</p>
<p>Deciding it would be best to humor her, besides I was tired, I stretched out beside my sister. I glanced over my shoulder as she swung her leg over my hips and settled herself into place astride me. I gave a deep moan as her hands dug into the muscles of my back along my spine.</p>
<p>Her hands moved to my shoulders. "I might not be able to help with PTSD, but I'll bet a massage will help keep you relaxed."</p>
<p>I could only moan in agreement as she began to make cat paws along my spine. My sister chuckled at me.</p>
<p>"I bet Mom, prude that she is, never mentioned me trying to qualify for a massage therapist license?" Olivia dug in deep when I shook my head, making me groan. "I tried it while I was waiting for a call back from a better ... well, more traditional job as an assistant to the assistant floor manager at Bed, Bath, and Beyond."</p>
<p>"Why did you give it up?" I looked over my shoulder at her sitting there naked on my back. "I mean sure you were perfect to work in the Beyond section, but still... ."</p>
<p>She gave me a quirky smile, moved her hands, and made my lower back pop with an audible crack. Then her hand moved to my butt cheek, she leaned forward, and I felt cold glass touch my side.</p>
<p>"Smarty-alicky comments from the peanut gallery will get you pegged with a bourbon bottle." She ran the slick glass up along my spine. "Capeesh?"</p>
<p>"Understood." I crossed my arms under my head and lay my cheek along my arm. Looking back at her I saw her smile, sit back, and open the bourbon bottle. She drained the last sips, did a little sway side to side dance then rolled the empty bottle across my back like a bread roller.</p>
<p>Olivia leaned down right beside my ear.</p>
<p>"I would love to try that someday. Pegging a guy. It sounds so hot." Her breathy whisper stirred the hairs on my neck.</p>
<p>I chuckled. "You've been going to some strange site online, huh?"</p>
<p>She placed a small kiss along my neck. "Everyone needs a hobby that keeps them horny. Unlike carving wooden walking sticks, Mr. Boring."</p>
<p>I shrugged and turned my head to the other side. "That's more in the way of mental therapy. And, a pretty good side hustle. That, restoring furniture, and a few other odd jobs keep me pretty flush, money-wise."</p>
<p>"Odd jobs, huh?" She leaned forward placing the bottle back on the ground. I felt her breasts press against my spine. Grinning, I moved so that my shoulder brushed her nipple. Olivia sat back up and poked me in the back of the head. "Stop it."</p>
<p>Smiling at having teased her, I settled my head back on my arms and let my sister's gentle touch work at the muscles on my back. The heat of her bare thighs across my lower back was a sensual warmth that made me want to forget that this was my sister. I wanted to roll over under her and allow the uncomfortable hardness under me to find a far better home for that aching bit of my flesh than pressed against my own thigh.</p>
<p>Olivia ran her thumbs down beside my spine, making me moan as the tight muscles bunched, contracted, and then reluctantly relax under her strong hands.</p>
<p>Under her skilled touch, I began to take less and less notice of silly things like distant fireworks, no matter how much they might sound like something else. Memories of times long past faded and the moment, this moment became the whole of who and what I was. I smiled feeling her hard nipples brought into play, teasing my skin as she slid her breasts along my back.</p>
<p>"I never got to have real fun with my clients when I was learning at the studio. I always had an instructor with their eye on my every move. Some of the others told me that guys will always hint at a 'happy ending' when they get massaged. Especially with the Asian girls." Olivia gave a giggle. "You want a happy ending, Joe? Me love you long time, soldier boy."</p>
<p>Laughing, I stretched out under her. "Yeah, I never got to serve in the deployment zones where they have massage parlors filled with beautiful Asian girls. Always Arabian women in black burkas, with too many gun-toting brothers, cousins, and uncles."</p>
<p>"Oh? Are you going to lay there and tell me you never got to 'enjoy' a twenty-four-hour pass? Isn't that a staple of the military?"</p>
<p>I gave a reluctant nod. "Yeah ... there are certainly places just off most of the bases I was at, well Stateside anyway, that had girls of ... loose morals and tight ... financial situations."</p>
<p>My sister giggled.</p>
<p>A few minutes later she swung her leg to the side and laid back down next to me. I turned</p>
<p>my head to look at her.</p>
<p>"Got tired." She gave a small shrug. "It's been a while since I gave a massage. I used to do about four or five half-hour-long sets a day."</p>
<p>"Why did you give it up?" I was so reluctant to move. I felt a lot like my spine might unbraid if I did.</p>
<p>She gave me a smirk. "Too many guys wanting happy endings."</p>
<p>I let my eyes linger on her breasts for a moment. "I can understand that."</p>
<p>Olivia giggled and then snuggled in closer to my side. "Why do I feel so comfortable being naked here next to you? You're my brother! That's not exactly normal."</p>
<p>Catching the edge of a blanket, I pulled it out from under us and draped it across the two of us. "Nothing in this place is any kind of normal. Naked sibling having cuddle time hardly even counts as weird here."</p>
<p>"I don't know ... I think even this wild place might frown on that."</p>
<p>Startled we both looked up to see Kathrine's head poked through the divider panel. Her gaze went from one of us to the other. They finally came to rest on me.</p>
<p>"As PTSD therapies go, I must say this one is novel, John." She gave a small shrug. "Keep it discrete; I'll mind my own knitting." Kat looked over at Olivia and then pointed at my sister. "Um, honestly, I have to say you're getting weirder, girl."</p>
<p>Olivia giggled against my chest and buried her blush red face into the sparse hairs there.</p>
<p>Kat shook her head. "A brother and sister sleeping together, what's next? Dogs and cats? Clearly a sign of the end of days. I swear."</p>
<p>She walked off muttering about the Apocalypse and whether she might have time to both get laid and eat some New York style pizza before the world ended.</p>
<p>Laughing softly, Olivia looked up at me. "She thought we've been fucking."</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>She gave a giggle that was half snort. "I am so embarrassed."</p>
<p>I nodded a second time.</p>
<p>My sister went to move away, to get up. I caught her half out of the bed and pulled her back to me. My lips found hers in the shadowy light and she gave a small gasp against my own as my hand cupped her ass and pulled her closer. I squirmed her half under me and pinned her to the bed while she wiggled and giggled, kissing me the whole time. The impromptu wrestling came to a stop when I was atop her and my hips rested between her open thighs.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>Looking down into her beautiful face, I supported myself enough to free a hand to brush her hair back from her eyes. The lusty but puzzled look in her eyes was delightful. I lowered myself down till she was pressed against almost my whole length.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>Pushing up with my toes and pulling myself forward with my elbows so that I rubbed the whole of my body along her. She gave a small gasp then wiggled under me making herself more comfortable. I felt my sister's breasts rub against my chest as my kissing lips tasted the soft skin by her ear. My cock, hard as iron now, rubbed between us, crossing that wiry landing strip I had seen earlier.</p>
<p>Olivia's hands rubbed along the muscles of my back and neck, the nails digging in making small scratches. Her lips nuzzled me by my ear.</p>
<p>"You can if you want." Small teeth nibbled me. "You feel so hard."</p>
<p>I eased to a stop. "Do you want to is the question."</p>
<p>Looking down at her pretty face, I saw Olivia bite her bottom lip.</p>
<p>"Yes ... yeah, I do." Her hand moved to slip between us to guide me inside.</p>
<p>At that exact moment, just as I was about to slip inside of my sister, I swear to you our entire camp came wandering back in. They turned up the outside gas lights, shadowing our partition. Tim and Jim began a loud discussion of the gay bars and nightclubs in Vegas .... and just why they were the best. Gloria chimed in about a really great lesbian vegan coffee shop she knew from when she stayed in Seattle.</p>
<p>Resting my forehead against my sister's shoulder and neck I began to quietly mutter curse words to myself while Olivia silently giggled. Then she began to jokingly whisper naughty things into my ear giggling the whole time.</p>
<p>"Oh, John, take me. Take me hard. Make me scream your name into the night like a horny banshee." My sister lightly dug her nails into my back. "Make me your woman, Brother. Claim my pussy as yours."</p>
<p>Propping up on my elbows I looked down into her face, and quirked an eyebrow. Lifting my hips, I shifted myself around till I felt the head of me at her entrance. Her eyes went wide and Olivia shook her head. I gave a small push of my hips, slipped an inch inside her and she quickly slapped her hand over her mouth to keep in the moan.</p>
<p>"Where are John and Olivia?" Jim asked.</p>
<p>I paused as I hear Kat pop out an answer. "I think they are asleep."</p>
<p>"Oh, damn, and here we are making all this racket." Tim's voice could have carried clearly all the way to the Man and still be heard at the Temple. "The poor things, they so badly need their beauty sleep."</p>
<p>Olivia gave me a small kiss that sealed in her moan as she pushed herself up the length of me. I however had to bite my lips to keep mine in.</p>
<p>The warm tightness of my sister as I settled fully into her was a delicious pleasure. I nodded at her whisper to not move. I simply held myself in her and kissed her. That was more than enough. Her breath was hot by my ear.</p>
<p>"Just there. Just that."</p>
<p>I nodded, doing my best to keep still even as, I swear, I felt her pulse throbbing along the length of me.</p>
<p>Outside in the common area Linda and Bill were discussing their trip to Jamaica back in April. It was a funny story, with Linda claiming to not remember half of it due to a tragic rum overdose. Bill said that he wished he couldn't remember it, given that he got a sunburned penis at a nude beach.</p>
<p>Olivia tapped my shoulder. She pulled me closer to whisper. "We're going to have to stop." She bit my shoulder as I sank in another inch. "No birth control, John."</p>
<p>That drew me up short. With a reluctant nod, I lifted myself up off of her and eased my way quietly to my feet. As I was looking for my cargo pants, I didn't see Olivia turn and sit on the edge of the bed. As I turned back to her she caught me by my hard and shiny handle and pulled me closer to her. Looking down I grinned at her as she began to run her hand up and down the wet length of me, a soft but firm pump.</p>
<p>"Cum for me," she mouthed without sound. At my nod, she looked down at my cock and watched every second of what she was doing with an intense interest.</p>
<p>Given that I had just been within my sister and was watching her giving me a hand job - with the look on her face being pure lust - it didn't take me too long to feel that ending growing nearer.</p>
<p>I tapped my sister's shoulder when I felt the point of no return approaching.</p>
<p>Looking up, she nodded and aimed me at her bare breasts, giving her sexy boobs a side-to-side jiggle while grinning up at me.</p>
<p>It didn't take much more than that smile to set me off.</p>
<p>It took all of my control not to let the world hear my pleasure as I felt her fingers tighten and loosen as I poured a small flood of cum over her thumb, to fall down and splash against the pale smooth skin of her breasts. Her nipple caught and then dribbled a thick string onto her bare belly.</p>
<p>As the last of it left me I caught her hand and pulled her up to me. Our lips met in a kiss that could have broken teeth had we been any more aggressive. Olivia's hand never left my cock, even as I started to soften. Her lips left mine and she whispered by my ear.</p>
<p>"I would have given you a really nice ... happy ending ... if we had been showering regularly." She gave me one last squeeze. "Sorry."</p>
<p>Shaking my head, I pulled her closer. "No apologies, that felt wonderful." I turned my head to the growing party developing outside. I now heard voices I didn't know talking to the others. I tilted my head that way before I said softly "We should probably get cleaned up and dressed."</p>
<p>My sister nodded, but her expression had turned naughty as hell. "I can not believe I had you inside me."</p>
<p>"Me either."</p>
<p>Her words were a warm heat by my ear. "I can smell your cum on my tits ... lover. Love you."</p>
<p>It is truly amazing how simple words can be so powerful. Love. Lover. Like twin wood chisels they dug into me finding soft wood to carve her feelings for me deep and permanent. Like a heart carved into a tree if was going to be there to be seen forever ... if only by me. If it was possible to hold my sister closer to me I would have done it.</p>
<p>"Love you," I told her as I buried my face in her soft hair.</p>
<p>"John?" She managed to turn her head and look up at me. "You okay?"</p>
<p>"I'm ... yeah, I'm okay. Come on let's get dressed." I nodded to the noise outside. "Sounds like we're hosting a party."</p>
<p>(Day 5)</p>
<p>Distant voices made of glass and razor blades began to cut away small slivers of my brain. Then, as awareness returned to my inner self, I began to notice a few of the simpler things. The hammering and flames of a blacksmith's forge behind my eyes. The art project in my mouth that used various types of cat shit. The smell of unwashed human armpit.</p>
<p>Opening my dust-encrusted eyes, I saw the reason for the last one almost at once. For some odd reason, I had my face buried in Olivia's right rib cage, nose half under her breast. I blinked at the pale glory of the Grand Tetons mountains this morning. Moving my chin reluctantly, fearing the whole time something in my neck would break, I looked up at her pretty face. Arm thrown over her face, messy hair a great halo around her head, drool running down to her chin. A soft delicate snore.</p>
<p>Licking at the dusty green fuzz on my teeth with a dry tongue, I eased myself out from under her half-naked body and sat on the side of the bed wishing to die. Just a nice quick death to take away the pain.</p>
<p>The needs of the bladder outweigh the suffering of the many ... or the one.</p>
<p>With a groan that hurt my own ears, I got to my feet, stuck my feet in sandals, put my hat on my head, and went to step out into the main tent. I stopped and looked down to realize that -- minus the hat- I was naked. With a sigh, I dug my dusty kilt out of the pile and belted it around my hips. To hell with a shirt. The heat of the day was already a blast furnace.</p>
<p>Stepping out into the tent, I had to pause and simply admire the sheer artistic levels of destruction that had occurred. As I looked upon it I had weird flashbacks to scenes of drunken mayhem that approached levels I had not been present for since my time in the military. The after-effect of twenty enlisted men given a twenty-four-hour pass could have rivaled this, but not much else short of an amphibious landing by a Marine division.</p>
<p>Bladder!</p>
<p>Doing a quick field step, limping in pain with every half stride, I made my way to what had become my favorite of the local port-a-lets. I have no idea why, but so far it had been kept astonishingly clean. Almost as if I was the only one choosing to use it. The ones beside it could have walked off-site on their own by lunchtime each day.</p>

<h2>Page 13</h2>
<p>It took me a half second after I pulled up my kilt to convince my muscles to relax enough and let me pee. I ended up resting my head on the side of the blue plastic as a yellow river flowed out from me. The sigh of relief came from my soul.</p>
<p>Sadly, the moment I finished the pounding in my head doubled down.</p>
<p>Trying not to puke, I made my way back to my tent and water. Icy cold water. Mouth-cleansing water. As I stepped back inside, I took two steps toward the big Igloo cooler but stopped ...</p>
<p>... Tim. Tim naked. Tim sitting in a folding chair, naked. Tim sitting in a folding chair, naked, painted with pink body paint. Tim sitting in a folding chair, naked, painted with pink body paint ... with a pair of women's panties on his head.</p>
<p>"I am way too hungover for this shit."</p>
<p>Grabbing a bottle of water, I judiciously avoided the nude man in the room. I stepped back into my curtained-off area for long enough to grab my normal EDC junk and a walking stick. The misery of overindulgence I knew - from many long bouts with this morning demon -- can be best treated with water, sunlight, and a long walk. I had a desire to look upon the wooden Eiffel Tower we had built at least one more time before it was burned.</p>
<p>Nibbling on a mushroom - walking slowly so as to not get my hip to hurt anymore than it was till the painkiller kicked in - I soon saw that my tent wasn't the only one to have been a party hub. Several campsites in the inner circle looked to have been the center of a hurricane. I could guess that, once more people began to drag their half-dead selves from bed, the moop cleanup was going to be legendary.</p>
<p>As I walked, I watched a group of Rangers admonishing a couple of people in a larger campsite to get started on it. That about turned me around. Given the shape my own camp was in. But then the vision of naked Tim, painted pink, wearing panties on his head flashed back to me and I kept walking.</p>
<p>Looking across the playa, I smiled seeing the tower rising up out of the heat haze. After a moment I squinted my eyes. There was someone sitting up at the very top.</p>
<p>As I got closer I saw that it was Kimberly. She gave me a wave.</p>
<p>Propping my walking stick against the bottom, I caught a structural beam on a corner and began the climb. Old memories of climbing log obstacles on morning PT came back as I was halfway up. These handholds were spaced much closer than that past insanity had been. I reached the top in good time.</p>
<p>"Morning!" She rocked and twisted around like we were not a hundred-plus feet up. "I came up here to watch the Sun come up. It was magnificent!"</p>
<p>I shaded my eyes and looked around at the huge semicircle of Black Rock City. "I was far too hungover to be up that early. Hell, I'm not even sure I was asleep yet at that time."</p>
<p>She nodded. "That tends to happen here. Especially your first burn." Kimberly began to point out the various art projects, often naming the artist that had built them. After a moment she hugged the top of the tower and rocked back and forth. "My first year here all I did was party till I passed out. I missed so much. Now, yeah I go dance and get my freak on a few times, but mostly I come for the art." Kimberly gave a giggle and tapped her head. "I'm already planning my sculpture for next year."</p>
<p>I grinned at her enthusiasm. "So, what can top this?" I patted the tower.</p>
<p>"A huge roulette wheel! Think a hundred feet across, spinning, with people tossing beach balls into it." She got a naughty smile. "Maybe some sort of truth or dare game for the losers. I'll have it figured out by next year. Or maybe not. I might simply let the others give me ideas. It's not just about me after all. I could never build something like this on my own."</p>
<p>I nodded understanding exactly what she meant.</p>
<p>Together we sat in silence just looking around. At last, she touched my arm and climbed back down leaving me with my thoughts.</p>
<p>Given what had happened with Olivia last night they were more than a little confused and ... troubled.</p>
<p>Deciding that Kimberly might have the right idea, I wandered Black Rock City for the day looking at art, and lending a hand where I could. Helping people who were trying to finish up projects before the end of the week. Several of these happily welcomed me into their camps and offered me food and drink of all varieties. By the time I let my feet carry me back toward my own camp, I had already eaten an early dinner and was carrying a bottle of flavored water. Admittedly, it was flavored with gin-soaked Mike and Ike's, but who cares. Hydration.</p>
<p>Chewing candy, I stepped into the tent to find everyone moving in a bustle.</p>
<p>"There you are!"</p>
<p>My sister came flying into me. She handed me half a dozen things and then flew back into the curtained-off area where we slept. A second later she ran back out and scooped up one of the folding chairs.</p>
<p>"Hurry!" She took a bag back from me and began to try and turn me around. I noticed that most of the others had already filed out and were headed toward the center of town. "We're going to be late!"</p>
<p>"Late for what?" I asked as I tried to turn back, but she spun me by the elbow and all but dragged me out of the tent. "Olivia? Where are we going? What's going on?"</p>
<p>Tim called back to us. "Hurry! We got an art car that will take us!"</p>
<p>Olivia tugged me faster. "Come on!"</p>
<p>Giving up, I limped faster. "Damn it, what is going on?"</p>
<p>"Kimberly is going to burn the tower!"</p>
<p>Olivia tossed Gloria her bag and Kat moved over to give us some room to stand on this art car. As we started to move I realized we were riding a short bus that was made to look like Clifford the Big Red Dog. Ears flapping, I hung on as we headed toward the tall tower in the distance. I could see other art cars gathering, and even the big rolling stage that was Mayan Warrior, all piling into a huge semicircle.</p>
<p>"I thought she was going to burn it after The Man burned?" I turned Olivia to face me. "I talked to her earlier, she didn't mention anything about it."</p>
<p>Olivia shook her head. "She dropped by about twenty minutes ago and told us. They asked her to burn it early since it is so large. They didn't want to risk having two huge fires burning in one night." She grinned at me as the big dog car lurched across a mound of playa dust. "Too much possibilities of runaway flaming moop!"</p>
<p>I shrugged and nodded that yeah that would be possible. I leaned out the side of the car and saw the crowd of bikes ahead. Looking like the start of a bike race, the inflow was enormous. Looking past them, I saw a good dozen people climbing the Tower.</p>
<p>"What are they doing?" Kat asked, pointing at the climbers.</p>
<p>"Rigging it to burn, I would imagine," answered Jim and he leaned way out the side of the car, holding on to a sidebar. He looked like he was windsurfing. His face split in a huge grin as the playa slid by below him.."Woohoo!"</p>
<p>Jim's excitement was infectious. By the time we reached the tower, we were all whooping it up. We piled out, me carrying an armload of stuff, and doing my best to follow my sister and her friends into the growing throng of people. Not too far off the huge speakers and amplifiers of Mayan Warrior began to pound out into the growing shadows. The many multi-colored lights within the crowd were becoming more and more brilliant as the sun sank lower and lower.</p>
<p>Looking up, I saw Kimberly standing alone atop the wooden Eiffel Tower she had crafted. She held a megaphone in hand. At a wave from her Mayan Warrior dialed down their music.</p>
<p>"Fellow Burners! Welcome! Thank you all for coming to see my project," A cheer went up from the crowd and she could be seen to visibly smile. "... and I hope that you have enjoyed it this week. But to all good things, there must come an end!" Again the cheering of the crowd drowned her out for a moment. "I love what me and my fellow artist created this year. It is large, magnificent, and beyond anything I could have ever hoped to do by myself. Thank you. Thank you!"</p>
<p>All of us joined in that cheering as she climbed her way down the tall wooden tower. I noticed city security beginning to move people back and a group of men in heavy silver fire suits had gathered by the base when Kimberly reached the ground. She nodded to them and they moved around the base.</p>
<p>She lifted the bullhorn to her mouth. "Lamplighters, if you would please come forward."</p>
<p>From among the crowd appeared several of the men in white and flame-hemmed robes that have carried lamps to light the streets this whole week. They formed a small circle around Kimberly. She smiled and nodded at a few. I was close enough that I heard what she said to them.</p>
<p>She gestured to her tower. "Gentlemen, ladies, we ask that you bring fire and light to this structure that we may chase back the darkness."</p>
<p>A tall bearded man carrying a lantern and a woman dressed in a fiery red shawl bowed their heads and stepped forward. The man turned to face us, as the woman moved with Kimberly to stand by the tower.</p>
<p>The man raised his voice till I'm sure it was heard far back into the crowd.</p>
<p>"For over twenty years the Lamplighters have come here to this place of union, joy, and community. We have helped hold back the night. To chase the darkness of the outer world into the shadows." He looked behind him and nodded. "And again ... this night ... it is my pleasure to present three gifts to you all. The first gift is..." He lifted his lantern high " ...ILLUMINATION."</p>
<p>The crowd cheered.</p>
<p>"The second gift is NAVIGATION!" Behind him, I saw a bright flame start on the side of one of the tower's four legs. "And the third gift is CELEBRATION!"</p>
<p>The crowd roared, but their combined volume was nothing to the power of the rolling art car Mayan Warrior as its sound system pulsed back to life.</p>
<p>Olivia tucked under my arm. Pulling her close, I watched that line of fire race to the top of the tower and then whooped as a huge bundle of fireworks went off, spewing sparks all over the tower. Bursts of flames lit in a dozen places and did not go out.</p>
<p>As the flames took hold security began to ease people back, but soon the heat began to do that job far better. Surrounded by people, we had to move when they moved. I held up a hand to shield my face as the heat off the burning tower doubled and tripled by the second, it seemed. We were soon standing at least fifty yards away, part of a huge circle of humanity. In the center of us the fire, for all the world a tornado of flames, twisted and swayed as the desert winds took hold of it and gave it greater life.</p>
<p>I looked around, seeking the familiar faces of our camp. Tim Jim, and Gloria were all three dancing to the music. Kat was standing still as a statue a few feet away. Her face was illuminated by the red-orange conflagration. I sought for Linda and Bill but they must be further to the right or left, hidden behind the crowd.</p>
<p>Then I noticed Kimberly.</p>
<p>The creator.</p>
<p>The artist.</p>
<p>She had moved closer to her burning creation than anyone. Standing there as a black silhouette, her arms raised in a giant Y as if she was praying to the flames before her. I grinned as I saw her reach down and pull off her top. Then I grinned even more when she slipped her shorts from off her ass and down her legs. She handed them to one of the guys dressed in silver suits. His covered head nodded understanding and he walked forward and tossed her clothes into the fire.</p>
<p>Olivia cheered beside me as those bits of cloth were caught in the fiery updrafts and flew upward like burning flags. Carried up into the great swirl of heat and flames.</p>
<p>A string of cloth was draped around my neck. Looking down, I saw that Olivia was now topless. She smiled at me, a wicked grin of pure mischief. My sister took hold of my belt and pulled me into a dance with her, leading me by that leather strap. She bit her bottom lip and then stuck the tip of her tongue out at me.</p>
<p>Grinning at her antics, I found it hard to keep my eyes off those pert breasts. Having seen them, hell felt them, more than once this week, the allure of seeing my sister topless was still just as strong as it had been that first day. When she tugged me closer by my belt I went willingly. She draped her arms around my neck and we danced looking into each other's eyes.</p>
<p>"Hey, big brother?"</p>
<p>Smiling, I leaned in. "Yeah, little sister?"</p>
<p>"Would you do something for me?" Olivia gave me a wink.</p>
<p>I chuckled. "You only have to ask."</p>
<p>She pulled me close to her lips. "Take me back to our camp and do naughty things to me." She glanced over at Tim, Jim, and Gloria. "Everyone is here. We can have some privacy."</p>
<p>"Seriously?"</p>
<p>My sister nodded, then shrugged. "I mean, we've already been ... connected. So, why not?" She grinned, then pulled me back in closer. "I just wish we had some condoms. You keep poking fun at me I might take you seriously. Then we would be in trouble deep."</p>
<p>Slowly I let the smile appear. "I found some today at an art project."</p>
<p>Her eyes got wide.</p>
<p>Laughing like two merry fools, we all but raced through the deepening darkness back to camp.</p>
<p>We had all departed so quickly earlier that no one had left a lantern-lit, so the tent was a cave of darkness when we arrived. And, to be honest, I had other things on my mind at that point so I didn't bother. Olivia ducked into her curtained-off area, with promises to be right back.</p>
<p>Stepping into my area, I used the nightlight to strip down and give myself a quick once over with a dampened cloth. I was making sure the ziplock baggie of condoms was by the bed when she came walking in, as naked as myself.</p>
<p>"Wow, that scar is evil."</p>
<p>Glancing over, I saw her looking at my hip. I turned to face her and directed my gaze south across my stomach. "I'm sure it's just the company it keeps."</p>
<p>Her eyes dropped to my cock, she gave a small blush and then looked up at me. "Does that like really work with the girls you date?"</p>
<p>I gave a small shrug. "By the point, they can see the scar and my dick, well, there is no need for pickup lines."</p>
<p>Grinning, Olivia closed the distance between us and took hold of me. Her fingers were tight around my cock, she lifted herself on her toes to kiss me. "True, so very true."</p>
<p>Kissing my sister with a passion I would never have given credit for possessing a week back, we made our way step by small step to the bed. Laughing, we both tumbled into the jumble of dusty sheets, dusty blankets, and dusty discarded clothing. Nibbling her neck, and caressing her earlobe with the side of my nose, I smiled hearing Olivia catch her breath and moan.</p>
<p>"John I ... ."</p>
<p>Lifting myself up on my elbows I looked into her pretty eyes. "Yeah?"</p>
<p>Her legs parted and wrapped around my hips.</p>
<p>"I ... I just wanted to ... well ..."</p>
<p>Laughing, I shook my head. "Spit it out already."</p>
<p>Olivia bit her bottom lip. "I love you."</p>
<p>Reaching up, I brushed aside the small beginnings of a tear by her eye before it could race across her cheek. "And I love you."</p>
<p>She squirmed a bit and looked away. "I'm not sure ... I mean... I can't ... damn it ... ."</p>
<p>Sitting up till I was astride her on my knees, a not too comfortable position for me I looked down at her naked breasts. "If you don't just tell me what it is you want, I'm going to tickle you till you do."</p>
<p>Olivia shook her head. "It's not what I want, it's what I think I want.".</p>
<p>Shifting myself a bit, I leaned back forward till my lips hovered over hers. "And what do you 'think' you want?"</p>
<p>"You."</p>
<p>Puzzled for a moment, I gave a small shrug. "You've got me, sis."</p>
<p>"No," She shook her head. "I don't mean now, just this moment. I mean ... well, forever."</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>She looked away. "Can I move in? With you, at your place."</p>
<p>Moving I laid myself down next to her, my hand on her stomach. "Why? What's brought this on? Sis?"</p>
<p>She pulled herself up till her back was against my footlocker trunk. "Being here, with you, in this mad place. Having you sleeping next to me." She gave a small giggle. "Kissing you. Doing all the naughty things we've done ..." Her eyes went to my cock " ... and are about to do, it's been .. it's been incredible. I mean you're not like any of the guys I've ever been with. They are all well, more like overgrown boys than men. With you, if something needs done you don't grab your phone and go to YouTube to try and learn how. You already know how to do it. I ... want that. Hell, I need that." She hugged a pillow to herself. "I'm kind of a mess, John. Inside, you know."</p>
<p>"And I'm not?" I turned and let my feet hit the floor. "I'm thirsty. If we're going to talk for a bit do you want a beer?"</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>Peeking my head outside, I saw that the tent was still dark and empty. Moving to the large cooler I grabbed out two icy bottles. Not my brand of choice, but it was cold, and here that mattered far far more. When I stepped back inside I saw that Olivia hadn't moved. Sitting back down on the bed, I popped the top on hers and handed it to her.</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>I nodded and swallowed cold sips from my bottle. "So?"</p>
<p>My sister gave a small shrug. "Never mind, it's not important."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is."</p>
<p>She shook her head. "John it's ... "</p>
<p>We both looked up hearing laughter approaching. I reached over and clicked off the small night light. As the darkness blinded us, my last sight was my sister's naked body.</p>
<p>Listening to the laughing, I picked out that it was Linda and Bill. They both sounded a little drunk and were giggling at nothing in particular.</p>
<p>I felt Olivia move to sit next to me. She leaned herself into my side.</p>
<p>Out in the darkness, I hear Bill ask his wife a question that brought a peal of bright laughter from her. Then she giggled and said yes, but then called him an evil bastard. They went quiet for a moment or so. I leaned into to whisper something to my sister but stopped as I heard a deep-throated moan of pain. It startled me so much I went to get up, but my sister caught my arm.</p>
<p>"Don't." Olivia pulled me to her lips. "She's fine."</p>
<p>"But?"</p>
<p>I felt her hair brush my face. "Exactly. Butt." She gave a small giggle. "He's in her butt."</p>
<p>The moaning got louder, and more and more hints of pleasure began to ripple through that sound of pain. I became aware of a hard smacking sound and it didn't take much to picture Bill behind his wife, thrusting in till his belly smacked her bottom.</p>
<p>My sister's hand wrapped around my cock, and when I looked down she kissed me. She stroked me as we listened to the two people a dozen feet away. My hand found its way to her bare breasts and my sister moaned into my mouth as I twisted her hard nipple. Her fingers tightened and I mirrored her moan.</p>
<p>My sister's lips moved to by my ear. "Fuck me while we listen to them." I felt the breathy grin. "Try and make me moan like that."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>
<p>Reaching over in the dark, I found the Ziploc bag where I had left it. I fished out one of the foil packets and with only a hint of lube in my mouth managed to bite the packet open. Getting it fitted over my dick in the dark wasn't the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but then I've scaled mountains in the middle of winter, so. The dim light in this curtained-off area wasn't sufficient to do more than show me the basic shape of my sister. I could tell Olivia had stretched out on the bed and was awaiting me with her legs open. I slipped in between those warm pillars. She wrapped them around my butt as I lowered myself onto her and I felt her hand move between us, guiding me into her.</p>
<p>There was a masculine growl from close by and a whimpering moan from Linda.</p>
<p>With a single thrust, I found myself plunging to the hilt in my sister. She was soaking wet inside. I smothered her gasp with my lips and kissed the breath from her lungs as she moaned out her pleasure at being filled so deep.</p>

<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>"Oh, yes right there," she murmured next to my neck as I began a gentle rocking inside her. Her ankles locked hard behind my ass and she pulled me in even deeper. "Right there."</p>
<p>Settling into a steady even rhythm, I found myself listening to the other couple as much as paying a hundred percent attention to where I was and what I was doing. Mind you the reality of just who I was doing it to might have been a bit of why I was seeking distraction. "Holy crap dude, you're fucking your sister!" was tumbling over and over in my mind.</p>
<p>Outside I heard Linda tell her husband to do her harder. She gave a small scream when he responded as she had asked.</p>
<p>"Faster," whispered my sister by my ear. "Faster."</p>
<p>Then her lips found mine in the dark and I was no longer distracted by anything beyond pleasuring the woman under me. My slow grind became a faster and then a faster again plunging into her. Short hard strokes that brought breathy gasps, which were pushed out of her and into my mouth. I was tasting her pleasure and enjoyment with every kiss. Olivia turned her head and pulled me closer to her. Hugging me painfully tight, drawing me in with every thrust. Her hands on my back dug jagged scratches as I bottomed out. By my ear, she was whispering things, little words of appreciation, lust, and bespeaking hidden desires. Tell me the nature of her wildest fantasies and leave me panting with a hunger to make those come true.</p>
<p>Each and every one of them.</p>
<p>We pulled each other closer and closer by the second, all the while listening to the couple next to us doing something just as wicked. If not, to judge by the sounds Linda was making, even more so.</p>
<p>Olivia shivered and shuddered under me, her legs trembling. She bit my neck and moaned out her orgasm into my flesh. I was right on the very edge of my own when I heard a deep soul-shattering moan from Linda and a coughing bark of sound from Bill. Then a soft whimper and a deep gasping for air.</p>
<p>Just as my own orgasm was about to fill the lambskin covering me, Tim's high voice rang out in the darkness.</p>
<p>"Well, I do declare Linda, hun, you took that in your cute little butt like a pro." One of the gas lamps outside lit, chasing away the darkness. "Bill, you big stud muffin bear you, anytime you want to kick the little wifey to the side for a night, I promise, I would love to let you do to me what you just did to your little honey-bunny."</p>
<p>Olivia grabbed the pillow next to her and put it over her face. I could feel her laughter all along the length of me.</p>
<p>"Tim ..." Bill's voice was all but breathless. "Now .... is not ... a good time."</p>
<p>"Oh, bless you poor heart, that little ass fuck done left you that spent?" I could hear Tim moving around outside. "Well, maybe it might not be a good idea after all. I wouldn't want to put you in the hospital or anything like that." He dimmed the light. "Well, sugar bear, I've got my colored lights and my one wheel and I'm off to ride the playa. We've hooked up with a group that has got a nude desert one-wheel race planned for tonight, and there is simply no way that I can miss that. Tootles, and Linda save me some of that dick for later."</p>
<p>Her tired but sated voice rang out. "Tim if you don't stop trying to steal my man, I'll lace on a strap-on and fuck your ass till you beg."</p>
<p>Tim laughed. "Oh, honey child, do not threaten me with a good time. Back in my wild college days, before I came out the wardrobe, I ate more pussy than a lesbian porn star and took more plastic than an ATM. I am not scared. Have fun y'all, wicked people. I'm off."</p>
<p>"We know that!" they said in harmony.</p>
<p>Olivia and I were hiding laughter in both sides of the pillow now.</p>
<p>(Day 6)</p>
<p>Awakening to the sound of someone scratching at the side of my enclosure, I turned my head towards the noise.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>Jim's voice answered me. "Sorry to wake you, but Kimberly dropped by. They are cleaning up at the tower this morning. She's asked for anyone that worked on the art project to please come by and help to clean the playa. She asked if we wouldn't mind joining in before it gets too hot."</p>
<p>"Sure, sure, give me just a second."</p>
<p>"Have you seen Olivia?" Jim asked.</p>
<p>Beside me, my sister stirred. "I'm here, Jimbo. My bed is too cold at night by myself."</p>
<p>"Oh," He paused and I heard a low chuckle. "Well, I was just checking. I'll throw us together something portable for breakfast."</p>
<p>"Sounds good," she and I both said at the same time.</p>
<p>"It will be ready in a few. Wish me luck, I've got to go wake Tim. He was out late and is never more than a grumpy grump at this hour, at best."</p>
<p>I had to hide a small moan as Olivia ran her hand up the middle of my back. She used my shoulder to pull herself up behind me. Her arms wrapped around me and I kissed the one closest to me as she buried her lips against my neck, just under my ear. I turned to look at her and we shared a quick kiss.</p>
<p>"Do you think we will manage to ever have sex without something interrupting?" She whispered by my ear. "I was thinking about maybe trying to sneak a bit of morning wood into me once we woke up today. Oh, well for that thought, huh?"</p>
<p>I chuckled. "I'm sure we can manage something here soon. If nothing else the moment we get back to my place - and we both get a long shower - I intend to do that very thing for the rest of that day."</p>
<p>She ran her fingers across my chest, nails scratching at the dusty skin."Oh, promises, promises. You will be exhausted from the long drive home and there will be a dozen things you have to take care of that have, no doubt, come up while you've been away. And where will I be? Huh? Sitting there, too horny to be sane and needing some male attention, while ignored."</p>
<p>I turned and slipped us both back onto the bed. I kissed her, then her neck, then took a nipple into my mouth. My sister gave a small squeak, then clung to my head as I suckled. I looked up, letting that hard bundle of nerve endings pop out of my lips.</p>
<p>"I will make your need for incestuous sexual depravity from your older brother be my top priority."</p>
<p>She wiggled her naked body under me. "Good. See that you do." Reaching up, she brushed my hair back from my eyes. "I love you ... you know that, right?"</p>
<p>"I know. " With a soft smile, I leaned in and kissed my sister. "I love you too."</p>
<p>"Comb the desert, do you hear? Comb the desert!"</p>
<p>The line from Space Balls rolled over and over through my head as I ran the rolling magnet over this section of burn patch for the tenth time. Ahead of me, two people were raking the playa trying to turn over anything for the magnet to pick up. Behind me - in an area we had already been over a dozen times - Jim was walking with a metal detector scanning the ground for anything we missed.</p>
<p>Kimberly had grid-ed out the whole area where her tower had burned with bright orange string and every able-bodied person she could get was "combing" a patch at a time of playa for anything left behind.</p>
<p>Down to frigging ash! Kat and Tim were sweeping the playa dust to make ash disperse on the wind.</p>
<p>Rolling over to the collection of wagons and Rubbermaids that was the dump site, I pulled all the blacked and twisted nails and half-melted bolts off the magnet and tossed them into the Rubbermaid designated for metal. A beautifully heat-blued metal washer I pocketed to make a charm out of. I had a couple of those jingling in my pocket already, but this was a nice one.</p>
<p>Looking over, I watched my sister's ass as she bent over and picked up some small pieces of burned wood. The curve of her butt in those denim shorts brought all sorts of ideas to mind. Ideas that, a few days ago, I never would have even begun to think about. It's this place. This weird crazy place where the normal reality of our society becomes the strange and twisted mirror to the every day you are living. Here in this desert. Here in this place of mad artists and nightly musical displays to rival the largest of concerts.</p>
<p>Looking past my sister's behind, I suddenly stood taller and started walking to where Kimberly was directing this cleanup. I doubled checked that I had my goggles and shook out my scarf as I did so. I knew I was going to soon be needing both.</p>
<p>Kimberly was facing me as I walked up. "We need to go over grid three once more then I think we're ... yes John?"</p>
<p>I pointed past her to the wall of white dust developing on the edge of the playa behind Black Rock City.</p>
<p>Following my finger Kimberly stomped her foot. "Shoot. Just when we were about done. PEOPLE!" She clapped her hands for attention. "We've got a dust storm coming! Let's pack it up. We were pretty close, as is. We'll have to do a double check later, once that's cleared out, but I think we got it. Let's get to cover before this blows in!"</p>
<p>People began to rush about gathering up tools, brooms, tote bags, and wagons full of Rubbermaids. We had just about everything together as the wind picked up and we saw tents and tarps in that area of the city begin to ripple. The city vanished into the dust even as we approached it.</p>
<p>Olivia grabbed ahold of my belt and, when I turned to look at her, I saw that she looked a bit scared. I pulled her in and used a large swath of my scarf to cover her head.</p>
<p>"It's just dust." I told her. "Nowhere near as bad as some that I have seen."</p>
<p>She nodded but then shrugged. "I got lost in that first dust storm. I about had a panic attack."</p>
<p>Ahead of us, as if to prove the point I was trying to make, I saw people dancing amid the white clouds. They appeared and vanished as the airborne playa thicken and thinned.</p>
<p>"This way!"</p>
<p>A couple of people nearby were gesturing towards us and we rushed over to their huge tent. Stepping inside we were handed drinks even as we unmasked and pulled off our goggles.</p>
<p>"Welcome. Welcome. Please join us."</p>
<p>I paused, blinked, and then blinked again. Looking over at Olivia, saw her blush, look at me, match my grin, and then we both chuckle.</p>
<p>Our naked hostess held out her arms wide to welcome us. "Come, throw off those dusty wrapping and take your ease. Hookah? The shisha flavor is mint. It will help to drive out the taste of the playa dust. Would you like some chilled wine, perhaps?"</p>
<p>My sister nodded in agreement. Another of the tent's occupants, also naked, directed us to a rug covered in a deep pile of multi-colored pillows. Small trays of brass stood nearby and upon them, I saw various temptations being offered.</p>
<p>A glance to one side showed me something that perked my interest.</p>
<p>Noticing this our hostess smiled. "Turkish coffee, sir?"</p>
<p>As our drinks were being poured Olivia looked at me, shrugged, and began to undress.</p>
<p>For some odd reason, it did not seem at all strange that my sister and I disrobed in front of these complete strangers. I kept my scarf loose wrapped over my shoulders. Easing down I watched as a single cup of coffee was made in a brass cup, in a bed of heated sand. The rich cinnamon scent of it reached me taking me back to a land far from here.</p>
<p>Looking around at this tent, I felt a moment's awe at the beautifully done recreation of an Arabian pleasure tent. The type of temporary dwelling that the rich like to set up outside of the cities in the deserts to allow the people to indulge in things the ridge laws there do not allow. Blowzy yellow linen walls and ceilings - with henna patterns done with dabs of reddish burnt umber ink - hid the canvas of the tent. It also helped to keep out the dust. There were thick many-layered rugs under our feet.</p>
<p>Then one of the people his head wrapped in a passable version of an Indian turban, began a simple rhythm on a doumbek drum. A few of the women stood up, moved to the center of the tent, and began a slow belly dance, in no way less sensual for the total lack of decorative silks normally worn.</p>
<p>Olivia passed me the end of a pipe and I took in a mouthful of the warm minty smoke. After a second or two holding it in my mouth, I took a deep breath through my nose and inhaled the sweet smell into my lungs. Tilting back my throat, I sent the spent smoke towards the billowing roof of the tent. The slowly swaying fans there spread it out. Closing my eyes, I felt the warmth of the smoke, and the many-scented heat of the tent wash over me. The buzz of the tobacco was almost instant.</p>
<p>"Your coffee."</p>
<p>Opening my eyes, I saw that a small bowl-like cup with no handle had been placed on the tray beside me with a bowl of wet grapes. I passed the pipe to my sister and watched her take a tentative puff, then a second longer one.</p>
<p>Sipping my coffee. I looked across the tent to watch a nude woman carrying a brass bowl. She knelt beside a man, and with no care about being observed, began to wash his genitals. The cloth she uses had rose petals falling from it as she wrung out the water and wiped him down. The man leaned back into the pillows and smiled at her. He had the look of utter relaxation that can be envied.</p>
<p>The task finished, she took him into her mouth.</p>
<p>"Wow..."</p>
<p>I glanced over at my sister.</p>
<p>"What?" I asked, a grin playing at my lips. "Are you blushing?"</p>
<p>"No!" She turned away a bit, then looked back at me. "Just wishing I was brave enough to do something that wild in public."</p>
<p>I chuckled. "Believe me, so do I."</p>
<p>Olivia gave me an odd look then got to her feet and moved over to the hostess. She spoke with her for a moment, The woman fetched the bowl, left into the back of the tent, and then reemerged a few moments later with a fresh bowl of flower-petaled water. While she had been gone my sister had joined the other naked ladies dancing to the drum.</p>
<p>Leaning back, I took a second long puff on the pipe and mouthed a few of the icy cold grapes. When my sister accepted the bowl and walked towards me I widened my eyes. She smiled seeing that, then knelt on a pillow beside me.</p>
<p>"John, lean back, and don't say anything ... before I lose my nerve."</p>
<p>Doing as ordered, I eased into the thick pillows behind me and watched my sister bathe her hands in the rose water. Then my sister took a soft cloth and began to wash me. She passed it first over my legs and lower stomach. Then she moved to my cock and balls, taking her time to chase every inch of dusty skin with a wet cloth. Often Olivia returned to the bowl, and each time I felt myself harden just a bit more at her touch. When wet skin replaced wet cloth I opened my eyes and looked down at her. Her fingers had enwrapped me and were slowly stroked the length of me.</p>
<p>"John ... tell me this is okay." She looked hesitant. "I'm ..." My sister glanced around and blushed seeing that we had an audience, including the man and woman across the tent that we had watched. "I want to ... I want to make this special for us both."</p>
<p>Reaching forward, I cupped her chin, and leaning up placed a kiss on those sweet lips. "Olivia ... please ... don't make me beg. I want you to do this so badly I can't stand it."</p>
<p>She blushed, then grinned at me. "Me too."</p>
<p>Leaning back into my pillows, I watched my sister take me into her mouth.</p>
<p>Gentle kissing and licks on the head turned into the warm wet feeling of being engulfed. Her tongue played games along the underside as she took me in an inch then pulled back, her lips pursed tight. My sister's fingers curled around the base of me, a tight pressure as she worked her mouth upon the head. I winced a little as she tried to push the tip of her tongue into the end of me, making the small hole flare around her tongue. Then she was licking me like I was a dripping ice cream cone. From base to tip then over and over again. Long slow licks.</p>
<p>Taking a small puff from the pipe, I leaned back deeper and - with a hand that shook slightly - I dared to sip my cooling coffee. The strong taste washed the mint from my mouth. I had to set the cup aside as her sweet lips took me deeper, almost to the base. I gave a small moan as she let her teeth gently rake the top and bottom as she pulled back.</p>
<p>"You like teeth?" she asked with a grin. Olivia placed a small nibbling bite along the side of me making me wince and moan. "I like doing that to a man."</p>
<p>I let my hand drift to her hair. I held her up short though when she went to take me back into her mouth. "And I like to nibble on a woman, so have a care. I give what I get ... little tease.</p>
<p>She smiled and kissed the head again. "Is that a promise to go down on me?"</p>
<p>I grinned and let her hair go. "I had more in mind of having you straddle my face and ride my tongue." At her raised eyebrows I nodded. "I really enjoy that."</p>
<p>My sister chuckled. "I've got pretty big hips, aren't you scared I'll smother you?"</p>
<p>I shook my head and picked back up my coffee. "If I'm doing it right, no. .. " I gave her a salute with the cup. " ... I will be too busy worrying about drowning."</p>
<p>She shook her head and laid my cock beside her chin, rubbing it along her face. Then her hand moved under me and cupped my balls. I watched and moaned my approval as Olivia lifted them to her mouth and bathed them with her tongue.</p>
<p>Closing my eyes, I relaxed completely, leaned back, and for a few blissful minutes enjoyed what my sister was doing. Without my distractions Olivia fell into a rhythmic bobbing, licking, and sucking upon me that I could have spent the rest of my life enjoying. When my eyes opened, I looked over her head to the couple on the other side. Having swallowed his seed, she had now stroked him back to a hardness. With a wink to me, she got to her knees and straddled the guy. I saw him slip into her and then she began a slow grind.</p>
<p>Looking around, I saw that we were no longer even close to being the only two couples in the tent now having some form of sex.</p>
<p>Reaching down, I placed my hand on Olivia's head, curling my fingers in her brown hair, and stopped my sister.</p>
<p>"What?" She looked at me blinking.</p>
<p>"Come here. I want you. Now." My voice was husky with the lust I was feeling for her. My need for her was hotter than the smoke and sex-rich air in this tent.</p>
<p>Olivia grinned. "Oh, you want me?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>My sister stood up, wiped a hand across her lips, and looked around at the others. She licked her finger and ran it down her sweaty body to her clit, giving it a wet rub. Walking to either side of my legs she lowered herself down and I caught her weight. My beautiful sister reached between us as I lowered her and impaled herself upon my cock. I joined her in moaning as I felt myself slide all the way into her. My sister gasped as I bottomed out in her.</p>
<p>"Remember, you can't cum in me. No condom." She leaned forward and place a hot musky kiss upon my lips. "And I'm going to have to depend on you to make me stop. I can't trust myself right now. Promise?"</p>
<p>"I promise."</p>
<p>She smiled. "Then lean back and let me give you as much pleasure as I can."</p>
<p>I grinned. "While taking as much as you can stand yourself?"</p>
<p>My sister ground herself down against me and moaned. "Absolutely... ."</p>
<p>With a slow rhythm that matched the beat of the drumming, she began to rock herself atop me. Hardly lifting, her shifting her hips driving me in deeper, then pulling me all but out before I was pulled back in.</p>
<p>Laying there, looking up at her ... my beautiful sister ... Olivia ... in all of her delightfully naked glory, I felt as if all of the worries, past and present fell away into inconsequential trivial nonsense. I was here. She was here. There were others around us, sure, some of them even watching us but it didn't matter. We were together. As together as two people could be together. Joined heart, body, and soul. A primal rhythm, of need and lust. Both selfish and selfless at the same blessed moment. Every roll of her hips gripped me in a tight massage of silky wet skin.</p>
<p>The swaying fans above us sent cooler waves of air across us. That air was thick with sexual musk, and warm with other odors. Sweat, and sweet smoke. The heat in the tent however was stifling, fans be damned, and the sweat poured from us both. Olivia was coated in a shiny gloss of perspiration, my sister shone almost like her skin was covered in oil.</p>

<h2>Page 15</h2>
<p>I heard a voice, soft and unimportant. "The dust storm is passing."</p>
<p>My hands were rubbing at the slick skin along her wet thighs, trying in vain to pull her down onto an inch I did not have to give. Olivia leaned forward, sweat raining down upon my chest even as she placed a soft breathy kiss upon my lips.</p>
<p>"Close?" she asked. At my nod, she pouted. "Me too. Can you last just a bit longer?"</p>
<p>I nodded even as I looked past her shoulder and saw that two of the people in this encampment were rolling up the sides of the front of the tent. Only a silky veil of light mesh now hid the small orgy going on inside. But the wash of cool air that brushed us was worth the possibility of being seen by others.</p>
<p>My eyes were caught by the woman across the tent from us. She was now on all fours, her head down upon a pillow, ass arched into the air. The man behind her was bathed in sweat and thrusting into her for all he was worth. I could hear the smacking of skin on skin from here. But, panting for breath, she was focused purely on me. On my face.</p>
<p>Feeling myself about to break a promise I looked away from her and up at my sister. Olivia had thrown back her head and was moaning in a low tone. Then a shiver shook her. Her thighs twitched under my hands and she gripped my arms just above my wrists. As a near shriek of pleasure tore its way from her throat Olivia pulled tight on me forcing me into her to the limit.</p>
<p>For a moment she held that pose, and I was captured by an unbreakable grip keeping me in place. I could feel myself as the tipping point was reached. I was going to cum inside her and I felt a moment's helplessness to stop it from happening.</p>
<p>"Olivia!" I moaned even though I felt myself surrendering.</p>
<p>My sister fell forward onto my chest and I was pulled from inside her with milliseconds to spare. I felt my cum spray a wet mess of white all between us.</p>
<p>Her lips fastened hot upon mine for a moment then she was by my ear whispering words of pleasure, lust, and love.</p>
<p>"I love you too," I whispered back.</p>
<p>By the time we arrived back at our tent my sister and I had at least managed to walk the wobble out of our legs. Or maybe we were leaning on the other enough to stabilize us both as we walked.</p>
<p>I saw that someone had laid out the solar panels for my Jackery generator and was charging it up. Inside the crackpot -no doubt what had drained the generator- was filled with a succulent-smelling soup.</p>
<p>Olivia looked in the pot. "Oh, goody."</p>
<p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Fruit soup." At my raised eyebrow she nodded. "Jim makes it. It has all kinds of dried fruits, apples, pears, spices, and fruit juices in it. It's good hot or cold."</p>
<p>Remembering that no matter how bad it could be, I have eaten worse, I nodded. "Sounds ... interesting."</p>
<p>She gave me an eye roll at my tone. "It's delicious! Grab us two bowls, I want to clean up." My sister moved over to stand right in front of me and grinned. "I smell like a French whore who just got fucked silly. Oui?"</p>
<p>Catching her by her hips and gave my sister a long kiss. Only turning her loose only when she began to move away.</p>
<p>"Food. Then more kisses." Olivia tugged my shirt. "You on the other hand smell like coffee, smoke, mint, and sex. Don't you dare change a thing."</p>
<p>Leaving her to change and clean up, I got our late lunch together. As I stirred up the soup I saw a ton of chunky bits of apple and I think she said pear, but among those were darker fruits. Dates, maybe? Certainly raisins. A small taste left me with a mouthful of cinnamon, clove, and star anise.</p>
<p>"Well?" she asked stepping back out of her enclosure.</p>
<p>I gave a shrug. "It's good. Kind of like eating Christmas, without having to chew the wrapping paper and spit out ribbons."</p>
<p>Behind me, I heard a chuckle. Turning I saw Jim.</p>
<p>He grinned at me. "My Swedish grandmother would hit you with a spoon for that comment." He gave a small shrug. "I grew up eating it. It's comfort food for me. Besides, it will be even better later tonight when it's cool and we're all too tired - or inebriated - to manage difficult food."</p>
<p>Before I could comment Tim came rolling in. He sniffed the air, took one look at the crock pot, and shot Jim a look.</p>
<p>"Oh, hell no you did not. Are you trying to make me fat as a goose? You know I ate myself sick the last time you made that." He fanned his face with a bit of his costume. "If I wasn't as hot as a firefighter stripper in this place I would have already gained twenty pounds due to you." He shot Olivia a look. "And you, little miss, I don't want to hear a damn thing from you when I get all pudgy. You've packed your mouthful at this event already too."</p>
<p>Turn. Walk away. Must walk to the van. Don't make eye contact.</p>
<p>I made it to the back door of my van before I completely broke down in silent -rib-splitting- laughter.</p>
<p>The tent was filled as the whole group gathered to get ready for tonight. As the sky had begun to darken the energy of the place ramped up higher and higher. Crowds of people began to migrate towards the center of the city and the tall wooden man standing so majestically there. Music from a hundred sources now thundered around us.</p>
<p>Stuffed with what I had discovered was a really good soup, I was decked out in what -for me- felt like a silly costume. Pretty much my hat, kilt, and shoes were the only things that belonged to me. My red tank top T-shirt shirt with "Make it Burn!' in neon pink, was a loan from Jim. I had Tim's white long coat/bathrobe. A bright red scarf was around my neck from Gloria. And I was draped in red lights.</p>
<p>And I was by far the most conservatively dressed of our group.</p>
<p>Walking together we often cheered with other groups of people for no reason that I could see. Just a primal scream of joy into the night to let the stars know we were here, and alive still. A wolf howl at the moon.</p>
<p>Kat bumped my arm. "John ... there is a big fireworks display at the start."</p>
<p>I sighed. "Of course there is." I took a deep breath looking toward the neon-lighted wooden figure we were walking towards... "I'm good. Seriously, I'm good."</p>
<p>Looking past me, Kat gave my sister a look that spoke volumes then nodded and moved over to walk beside Bill and Linda.</p>
<p>A hand smacked my shoulder. Turning, I saw Robert the Pirate in full Black Beard pirate regalia. A grin like a mouth full of subway tile.</p>
<p>"Arrg, Mattie!"</p>
<p>I grinned. "Arrg, back."</p>
<p>He handed me a skull and crossed bone engraved metal flask. "First time to get to see The Man burn! Lord, I wish I was that new again. This is my fifth time. Still gets me in the feels each time, though. Always a different show, but kind of the same at the same time, if you understand."</p>
<p>I laughed and took a sip of what was some spectacularly good rum. Handing it back I said, "I'm still trying to figure this whole thing out, buddy."</p>
<p>He laughed. "Good luck with that." He took a big sip. "The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not see, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was." He pointed the flask at The Man. "And there stands the biggest dream of them all."</p>
<p>"How so?" asked my sister.</p>
<p>Robert the Pirate held out his arms wide. "The Man is the simple wooden avatar of a dream. That all the problems of the world can be burned in effigy and the whole world live in peace, surrounded by art. Music. And love! Would that there were such a dream, and we did not have to awaken from it."</p>
<p>"So you would stay here forever?" I asked. "Make this place a permanent city in the desert."</p>
<p>He shook his head violently, that black beard swaying. "Oh, no! No, no, no. It is the very fleeting nature of this place that gives me some sense of hope for us poor race of upright monkeys." He gestured at the tents we were walking past. "Here we can ... for a little while ... make a dream a reality. But, it would fade to the normal madness that is normal life if we tried to make it last. That is why The Man must be burned! For if we did not set him ablaze the idea would grow that we could stay here. But to be here longer, we would need rules. Laws. Government. Money. Commercialized normality. All of the trappings of civilization we have done our best to leave behind when we come to this place."</p>
<p>I nodded my understanding. "A normal life."</p>
<p>He stopped and turned to face me. He placed a hand on each of my shoulders and looked me in the eyes. "Man is mortal. A waking shadow. A poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more."</p>
<p>Olivia, to my surprise, finished the quote. "A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."</p>
<p>Laughing, I shook my head. "I don't understand."</p>
<p>He smiled. "Only in this place - where nothing is more permanent than our little lives -- can we build things such as dreams are made of." He pushed the flask into my chest. "Live for the moment."</p>
<p>That one I knew. "For tomorrow we all may die?"</p>
<p>He nodded. "No rules made by others, only our own desire to do right and not wrong. To give for the pleasure of giving. By joining in and helping for the satisfaction of having helped. To not value what is worthless but made costly by flash and glitter." His grin spread across his face. "To stand and hold fast in the face of all challenges. To live the best life you can live and then to pass from this world leaving only memories. That is what this place is about and The Man is the symbol that we ... tried ... our best to do all of that." Robert gave my shoulder a shake. "Come, my friend. Let's go watch him rising into the heavens aflame."</p>
<p>I nodded. Still not entirely sure what he meant ... or if I wasn't losing my mind but -- as I looked over at my beautiful sister -- I decided that, in this mad place, to be sane isn't normal anyway.</p>
<p>So ... fuck it.</p>
<p>Catching her arm, I pulled Olivia into me and gave her a long kiss. Before any and all and I couldn't give a damn who saw.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, no one seemed to care.</p>
<p>Linda, Bill, and Kat had vanished off to one side. They had made friends at one of the inner camps and were going there to watch the show. The rest of us found ourselves gathering close to an art car. It resembled a 1960s dinner and was serving free grilled cheese sandwiches and grape Kool-Aid slushies.</p>
<p>From its roof, PA speakers that wouldn't have been out of place on the set of M.A.S.H were thundering out an incredibly 'squawky' version of Rider's on the Storm on shuffle repeat with other Doors songs.</p>
<p>Olivia, both of us now buttery-lipped with purple tongues, were dancing together.</p>
<p>Gloria, Tim, and Jim were over to one side talking with an older couple.</p>
<p>I looked around when the volume of sound began to settle lower and lower.</p>
<p>All eyes were now turned towards The Man.</p>
<p>A roar of cheering when up as his arms illuminated in bright neon green lights - slowly raised from his sides towards the heavens. My sister and I added our own voices to this thunder of approval.</p>
<p>Looking past the heads of the crowd, I could see that there was now a wide space forming around The Man. Within that circle there were now burning pillars of flames. Then the part I was dreading began. The pop pop pop of fireworks going off. The massive display of colored sparks showered the wooden structure in burst after burst.</p>
<p>Olivia slid into my side and took possession of my arm. Looking down into her face, I winced when one explosion was a memory trigger, but I let her beautiful smile distracts me from that memory.</p>
<p>Leaning in, I kissed her and she kissed me back.</p>
<p>A great shower of sparks engulfed The Man but I barely paid it any mind. I was too involved in what I was enjoying.</p>
<p>We did both turn quickly and cheer when a huge pyro effect sent a mushroom cloud of flames billowing up towards the sky, to the approval of the tens of thousands gathered around it. I held up a hand to block the wave of heat that reached us moments later. Rows of sparks spewed all around the base structure and more fireballs erupted.</p>
<p>In moments the whole great edifice was aflame.</p>
<p>Had we not seen our tower burn the night before I feel like I would have been more impressed. Still, it was a different type of burn. The Tower had been a massive column of fire following the point upward in a great pillar of flames stretching towards the heavens. This was ... a pyromaniac's wet dream-given form.</p>
<p>Having to turn my face away from the flames, I looked around at all of those gathered here. Faces bright red and orange in the burning light of The Man's final hour, I saw smiles, joy, sadness, tears, and in a few faces even hope. It made me wonder what my face must be showing to any that might look upon me at that moment. Glancing down at my sister, I saw my own image reflected in her eyes but couldn't place a name to what I saw.</p>
<p>I was too lost in the overwhelming feelings I was having for her.</p>
<p>Gone now was any hesitation about the intensity of my feelings. Sure there was desire and lust, but there was also now a growing love and passion that had little to do with her being my sister and everything to do with her being my lover. This was the woman I loved. The fact that Olivia and I shared a mother and father was a circumstance beyond our control, but also one that was unimportant. At least here, in this place of madness, flames and artworks inspired by both.</p>
<p>I kissed her again.</p>
<p>Pulling her to stand in front of me, my arms holding my sister to my chest we stood and watched the fire consume The Man. Bits of the structure would fall into the burning core at times sending huge billowing clouds of sparks into the sky. Often the night winds would cause these sparks to drift, but no one seems to panic at that. They simply moved out of the way, then wandered back.</p>
<p>I watched the faces now as much as the fire. Faces upturned towards the burning heart of Black Rock City. Illuminated by man's most primitive god. Fire.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>Looking down at Olivia, I gave her a soft smile. "Yes, love?"</p>
<p>She gave the huge fire one last look then tugged at my hand. Pulling me back towards camp. I saw her mouth the words "Come on, lover." but couldn't hear them given to the cheering as The Man's wooden form gave up and tumbled into the raging flames at his base.</p>
<p>Allowing her to lead me, we made our way back to our tent. Others were still walking toward the center of the city. We were among the few moving away from the main attraction tonight. Perhaps these others had seen the show many times before and were now jaded to its final moments. Or perhaps they were simply tired. Worn out from the days of heat.</p>
<p>Maybe a few were leaving to go make love, as we were.</p>
<p>As we reached the tent and passed inside, there was no need for words between us. We stepped into my ... our ... enclosure and began to help each other out of our clothes. All soft kisses, strong caresses, and exploring hands we tumbled into our bed and kicked the blankets off to the side and out of our way. After a moment I reached for a condom but Olivia stopped me. Shook her head, and took me literally in hand.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" I asked.</p>
<p>My sister nodded. "I'm sure. Don't cum in me if you can help it, John, but I want to feel you in me ... bare and raw. And now. Don't you dare make me wait even a second more."</p>
<p>Catching my sister by the short hairs on the back of her neck, I smiled at the look that brought to her face. Moving her by that erotic handle I pushed her forward onto the bed, placing my sister onto her hands and knees before me. Turning her hair loose, I let my hand follow the valley of muscle along her spine till I crossed to her hip and dug my fingers into her fleshy thigh. With a moan neither of us even tried to hide, I pushed myself inside her.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes just like that," she moaned.</p>
<p>With my hands on either side of Olivia's ass, I pulled her to me even as she pushed back against me. Between us, we came together in a hard smack that caused us to rebound. I almost slipped out of her and then slid back inside. In the distance we could hear the sounds of the crowd around The Man. Music - the deep base giving us our rhythm - came at us from every direction. The cool night air was now pouring in through the open ends of our tent. The partitioning blocked some of it, but chilled breezes bathed our sweaty skin as we chased pleasure together.</p>
<p>After several minutes of that slow-motion thrusting, I began to feel a stitch of pain in my hip. I had abused it to the point of insanity this week, and now it was punishing me back. I grit my teeth and drove myself faster trying to get past that ache. Sex isn't supposed to be comfortable, after all.</p>
<p>Another minute and I was starting to hurt enough that it began to distract me.</p>
<p>Olivia glanced back over her shoulder at me, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Sorry, my hip."</p>
<p>She harrumphed. "Well lay flat, silly. I'll happily do the work. Move." My sister thrust her ass back at me bumping me out of her. In fact, she almost bumped me off the cot! Her hand caught me as my balance went screwy, then she guided me till I was laying stretched out on my bed. Olivia gave me a wicked grin. "Now, decisions, decisions. Cow Girl, or Reverse? Do I want to look at your face, or have you looking at my butt hole the whole time?"</p>
<p>I chuckled. "If it's winking at me you can't blame me for staring."</p>
<p>My sister gave me a smirk. "Fine. I'll just look at your toes and do 'This little Piggy went to Market' if I get bored."</p>
<p>Grinning at her humor, I reached out and tickled her side as she swung a leg over and settled herself atop my hips. The warm heat of her thigh acted like a therapy heating pad on my hip as she wiggled around. With a slight lift, a guiding hand, and my beautiful sister impaled herself upon me with a moan. Her weight drove me far up inside of her.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," she purred. "Right there."</p>
<p>Placing my hands on her wide-spread hips, I gently pulled Olivia to me, but most of the effort was coming from her rolling her hips. Letting my eyes roam up her back I was entranced by how her brown hair swung from side to side across her shoulders, the bottom edge getting damp from brushing sweaty skin. I watched a ribbon of sweat drip-free and roll down her back, following the valley of her spine. My eyes follow that pearly drop till it vanished between the cheeks of her ass. That lead my gaze to the plump butt cheeks my hands were framing. And, of course - given her earlier teasing prompting - my eyes lingered on the tight rose hidden in that valley. I moved my thumbs around and cupped the bottom of her ass cheeks and, with a massaging caress, spread her a hint more.</p>
<p>My sister looked back over her shoulder at me, leaned way forward, and wiggled herself down tight on my cock. "Enjoying the view back there, brother?"</p>
<p>I almost couldn't pull my eyes away from the way my cock spread her lips wide around me. Looking at her sweaty face, I matched her grin. "Oh, absolutely."</p>
<p>She giggled. "I can not believe we're doing this. Oh, my god, Mom would have a cow!"</p>
<p>I nodded. "And Dad would murder me."</p>
<p>My sister rolled herself up and leaned way back till I was holding her by her sides and her hair was in my face. "And then they would stick me in the nut house till I was 'over' this batshit 'phase' of wanting to have sex with my brother."</p>
<p>Letting my hand roam up and onto her belly I felt the divot of her belly button and moved south from there. As my fingers dipped between her thigh she moaned and slid back till I popped out of her. Small circles around her clit had my sister squirming as she lay atop me. I kissed the side of her neck.</p>
<p>"Are you going to get out of this 'phase' anytime soon?" I asked in a teasing whisper by her ear.</p>
<p>Olivia spun herself atop me till she was looking down into my eyes.</p>
<p>"I love you."</p>

<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>I blinked in surprise at the serious tone in her simple words. My hand ran along her spine, a gentle caress of the taunt skin there.</p>
<p>"Do you love me?" she asked.</p>
<p>Hugging her to me, I placed a small kiss on those pert lips then a longer one. A much longer one. My forehead moved against hers in a nod as we both gasped for breath moments later. "Always."</p>
<p>"Say it," she demanded then.</p>
<p>"I love you." I moved to kiss her again, but her fingers appeared atop my lips stopping that kiss.</p>
<p>Leaning down by my ear my sister, my sweet sister began to whisper some of the most naughty and erotic things into my ear. Things she wanted me to do to her, and things she wanted to do to me. I felt myself harden back like a bar of steel at some of those wicked suggestions.</p>
<p>Grinning at me she sat back up, reached between us, and guided me back inside her. She was hot as a furnace and wet as a water slide.</p>
<p>Holding Olivia by her hips, I watched her cup her breasts, pinch the nipples taut, and then twist them hard enough to make her moan. There was an aggression to her moments now, a hot desire to reach a point of shared pleasure that we had not reached yet. Her riding me was pushing me closer and closer to my orgasm, and seeing her face as she chased her own lust was almost more than enough to push me over the edge.</p>
<p>"John ..." she breathed my name. A shudder of gasped breath with every letter given power. "Now ... please..."</p>
<p>Nothing could have stopped me then. No other thoughts intruded to make this moment any more second-by-second focused. I was gripped by that unstoppable urge even as she rocked harder and harder atop me. My hand came up to touch her but she caught it and used it as leverage to pull herself even harder down on me.</p>
<p>"John, now!"</p>
<p>Within her, I felt a tightening of muscle, a rhythmic contraction that surged down me and then relaxed. In that pause, I felt the first of my cum leave me to spray up within her. Through my mind flashed the thought "I'm cumming in my sister. In Olivia!"</p>
<p>That tighten grip returned, milking the length of me, and pulling every throbbing spurt out and into her.</p>
<p>With a cry that was half moan half scream, she locked up atop me, holding tight to my hand with a grip that hurt and drove her fingernails into my skin. Then her muscles went slack and my sister collapsed forward onto my chest.</p>
<p>Breathless, trying to get enough blood back into my brain to decide if we had just made a mistake, I held he as she whimpered, and tried to catch her own breath. Her legs twitched and trembled every few moments. Finally catching my breath, I nuzzled her hair out of the way and placed a small kiss by her ear.</p>
<p>"I love you." I kissed her neck again. "I always will."</p>
<p>Then I proceeded to whisper to her all the naughty things that I enjoy, and the ones that I wanted to do to her. Soon she was trembling with lust and giggling at a few of them. I shifted her till she was laying beside me.</p>
<p>We both fell silent as we heard someone enter the tent. Male voices, soft laughs, a mumbled suggestion I didn't catch but that made my sister silently giggle into her pillow.</p>
<p>At my puzzled look, Olivia leaned in by my ear. "Jim and Tim."</p>
<p>A few moments later there was a low moan, and then a deeper masculine groan of pleasure from the other side of the tent. A hard smacking of skin on skin and more moaning soon followed.</p>
<p>Laying there - holding my sister as she tried to not die from suppressed giggles -- listening to two men have sex, a novelty for myself I must say, I gave myself time to worry a bit about the fact I had cum inside of Olivia without any protection. I didn't regret it, but at the same time, I was a hint concerned about the possibilities. By the time that the grunting masculine moans and breathy whimpers came to an end, I had worried myself into a spiral of thoughts. Beside me, I could tell that Olivia was starting to fall asleep.</p>
<p>My head turned at new voices.</p>
<p>"Are you sure everyone else is still at the bonfire?" asked a woman's voice.</p>
<p>A male voice answered. "Positive."</p>
<p>Looking down, I saw that Olivia was now wide awake again and had her hand over her mouth. At my raised eyebrow she moved to whisper in my ear.</p>
<p>"Linda and Bill."</p>
<p>From across our tent came a woman's high laughter and the sound of rustling cloth. Then a giggle and male laughter joined hers.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes there is my favorite sex toy. You ready for mommy to make it feel all better?"</p>
<p>Bill answered his wife in a husky tone. "Yes, Mommy, your daddy is all hard and ready for you."</p>
<p>Olivia gave a small snort behind her hand, then hid her whole head in pillows and shook the bed with her suppressed laughter.</p>
<p>As our tent held its collective breath in amusement, the quiet married couple we had shared a tent with for the week began to have the loudest and most vocal sex I'd ever heard. Linda's pleasure screams had to be heard half across the playa. I don't know how Tim managed to not comment. Jim may have had him gagged with a sheet to keep him quiet. I almost had to do that with Olivia a few times.</p>
<p>And it went on and on.</p>
<p>After a good long while I began to wonder if some form of Viagra might be involved. Those "seek medical help if you have an erection lasting more than four hours" commercials began to play in my mind.</p>
<p>When it finally ended I wanted to applaud but restrained myself somehow.</p>
<p>Looking down I saw that Olivia's eyes were almost closed. I placed a soft kiss on her lips, She smiled and snuggled closer to me. Covering us both with a blanket, I gave a thought to staying awake a bit longer to see if Gloria or Kat were going to wander in to have sex. But it was only a lingering idea as sleep took me far too quickly.</p>
<p>( Day 7)</p>
<p>There was far too much noise in the tent for so early a morning was my thought on waking. Extracting my dead-numb arm from under my sleeping sister's head was an exercise in limp pasta manipulation theory. Massaging out the pins and needles, I got to my feet. Threw on a semblance of clothes and stepped out into the common area.</p>
<p>I saw Bill's back as he walked out the tent carrying a Rubbermaid. Looking through the opening of their enclosure I saw Linda was packing up their camp bed. Walking over, I tapped on the canvas.</p>
<p>"Morning."</p>
<p>She looked up and smiled. "Morning, John. Sleep well?"</p>
<p>Oh, I so wanted to say something. It took all the restrain I had to keep that naughty comment behind my teeth.</p>
<p>I pointed to the stack of half-filled plastic boxes. "Pretty good. Ya'll heading out?"</p>
<p>Linda nodded. "Yeah, Bill wants to try and get ahead of the traffic and leave early." She gave a small shrug. "We saw the tower burn and The Man burn. I don't see the need to stay and see the Temple burn. Besides ... I want a shower! And air conditioning! This has been great, but I am heat cooked and filthy."</p>
<p>"Excuse me, John."</p>
<p>I stepped out of the way for Bill as he grabbed up a second box and did a spin around to carry it out.</p>
<p>I gestured towards where my sister and I slept. "Let me grab my shoes, and I'll give you a hand packing out."</p>
<p>Bill nodded thanks as he walked past me, but Linda shook her head. "You don't have to do that, John. We packed light and besides. We're leaving you with this whole great tent to pack up without our help. I'm sorry about that, by the way."</p>
<p>I waved that away.</p>
<p>"I could manage it by myself if I had to. More hands just makes it quicker, not necessarily any easier. Let me wake up Olivia, I'm sure she will want to say goodbye, and we'll get you on your way a bit sooner."</p>
<p>I turned and found a very sad and disheveled looking Tim standing behind me in a terrycloth bathrobe.</p>
<p>"You noisy people are exaggerating my hangover." He said in a pitiful voice, while scratching at his wildly static-fluffed-out hair. "I distinctly left a never wake up call for this morning."</p>
<p>Bill came walking back in. "Sorry Tim. Trying to get loaded before it gets too hot and trying to get out of here before the stampede for the exits starts."</p>
<p>Tim nodded and walked over to the coffee pot. "You are not forgiven, Bill. You didn't make coffee." He glanced at me. "Morning, John. Sleep well?" He shot me a wink and a glance back at Linda and Bill. "Looks like someone did at least. All full of energy this morning."</p>
<p>I nodded and hid a smile. "Well enough. Let me help with that."</p>
<p>Between the two of us we got water in the coffee pot, a filter nicely filled with coffee and the drip coffee maker plugged into the Jackery generator. I checked the charge. Looked like it would need it's panels out to make the day. Another item on the to do today list.</p>
<p>Tim turned back to where Linda was still packing and was about to make what I'm sure was going to be a blush worthy comment, when he stopped in mid swing. "Oh, look it's a kitty cat. Good morning Henrietta Pussycat. You look lovely this morning."</p>
<p>Glancing up from getting two cups filled with sweetener and dry creamer, I saw that Kat was pinning back the cloth curtains of her enclosure. She gave Tim a snarky look.</p>
<p>"Meow meow, bad men make too much noise, meow meow," she muttered. Her eyes looked me over. "Coffee?"</p>
<p>I nodded, even as I filled up cups for Olivia and myself. "Done."</p>
<p>She gave my side a poke as I passed her with the cups. "Staying for the Temple burn?"</p>
<p>"Far as I know, here till tomorrow in the morning." I nodded, trying to hold still the shook cups of coffee.</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>Leaving her to her coffee. I stepped inside to find a half awake and naked Olivia sitting on the side of the bed. I handed her her coffee and sat down on my trunk.</p>
<p>"Bill and Linda are leaving."</p>
<p>She nodded and took a sip.</p>
<p>"You okay?"</p>
<p>My sister gave me a look then a small reluctant nod.</p>
<p>Feeling like I had lead in my stomach I had to ask. "Regrets?"</p>
<p>Olivia looked down into her coffee. "Confusion, uncertainty, a bit of worry ... but ... no. No regrets. I'm glad we did what we did, and I will happily do it again." She looked up at me, her eyes twinkling. "I must say you are an evil addiction for me, brother. I'm already edging for another 'fix' like last night even though I'm a bit sore." Olivia bit her bottom lip. "And I can not believe I told you all of those things."</p>
<p>I grinned. "Done any of them?"</p>
<p>She gave a small shrug and blushed. "A couple."</p>
<p>"Same." I leaned over and clanked our coffee cups together. "Here's to future naughtiness."</p>
<p>We sipped our coffee and shared grins.</p>
<p>It was with a few aching joints that we got to our feet and went out to help Linda and Bill - or Mommy and Daddy Fuck-Fuck as I will forever secretly call them in my mind from now on - to get packed out. There were a few teary hugs and then their SUV vanished off into the dusty playa.</p>
<p>The big tent looked larger and more empty with just that one enclosure taken down. I could tell from the quiet conversions over breakfast that we all could sense a change. Other this week together we had become a bit like an extended family. Now we were about to drift off as, well still friends, but not as close as we had been. I looked around at the various faces.</p>
<p>My eyes settled on Kat.</p>
<p>When exactly had I stopped thinking of her as Kathrine? When had I stopped actually calling her Nurse Gillian in my mind, for that matter? At the Temple, maybe. Earlier?</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>Looking up from my empty plate, I saw that everyone was looking at me. "Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" Gloria asked. There was real concern in her eyes.</p>
<p>Even as I nodded, I glanced around seeing that same expression mirrored on other faces. "Yeah, I'm fine. Just lost in thought." Getting up, I put my plate in the shallow wash basin we had been using as a sink. Given we had to pack out any wash water with us, it was mostly there to gather dirty dishes into one place. "I'm going to go take a walk. Clear my head. I'll grab us some ice while I'm out."</p>
<p>As I headed out into Black Rock City I saw that Bill and Linda were not the only ones trying to beat the exodus traffic. In fact the choke point over by the entrance looked nearly as crowded as it had been when we arrived.</p>
<p>Deciding to walk out to where The Man had been to see what was left, I smiled seeing that there was still a crowd of people gather there. Many sitting on blankets, a few up and gathering moop from the surrounding playa. In the center there was a small fire burning. People were throwing bits of un-burned Man into it to keep it going. Seeing a dust covered chunk by my foot, I picked it up and did my part to keep The Man burning. I also picked out a burning stick from the fire and lit me a nice Davidoff cigar to start my morning.</p>
<p>Standing there smoking, I looked across the playa to the Temple. Glancing behind me, I tried my best but couldn't make out the dark canvas of my tent . It was still hidden behind too many others and a bit obscured by the rolling dust ghosts that were drifting across the desert this morning due to cars leaving. Even as I watched four big RV's began to pull out, breaking up the square formation they had been in.</p>
<p>Running my hand through my hair, I shook out a small dust cloud myself. I sent a puff of smoke to chase it away.</p>
<p>Gloria was concerned for me. So were the others. I was sad that Bill and Linda had left. Who were these people to me? Who was I to them?</p>
<p>Memories of the strong bonds that I had once had with the members of my unit. Even the ones I only saw in the larger formations were still a part of the whole. I could look at any one of them and think "This guy has my back no matter what." and I would have done the same for them. Yet here, after a week in this dusty hellscape, and I was feeling that same kind of feelings for this motley group.</p>
<p>"End of the week blues, John?"</p>
<p>I looked over and saw Kimberly walking up fanning her face with her hat. I smiled and gave a shrug. "Thinking deep thoughts."</p>
<p>She placed her hat atop her curls. "There are a great many veteran burners here this morning doing that very same thing. So many of us wish this could never end. But then The Man burns and we know it's going to end no matter what we do." She pointed to the Temple. "A few can't even stand to wait long enough to see that beautiful bit of collective art burn. Too many good times, too many wild moment they don't want to see become just memories. They leave early so that they can pretend that Burning Man never really ended this year." She bent down and picked up a small charred bit of wood. "Or - if they stay- they huddle here by The Man's ashes and keep a small fire smoldering all day."</p>
<p>I nodded understanding both feelings.</p>
<p>"And you?" I asked after a moment.</p>
<p>Kimberly smiled and pocketed the little bit of wood she was tumbling in her hand. She brought two ash covered finger up to her face and painted black lines under her eyes. "Me? I'm going to go get my party on before this day ends, and be drunk off my tits when the Temple burns tonight. I'm ready to howl at the moon! Nothing is over till we say it is!"</p>
<p>A passing burner said "Amen, sister, Amen!"</p>
<p>"Make a day of it, John. Carpe fucking diem!" She gave me a wave and followed that guy back toward the shrinking city.</p>
<p>Looking at my stub of a cigar, I took one last too-hot puff, then walked over to the fire and tossed it in. With a grin for the insanity of this place, I went to find the ice.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, here in the middle of a desert it decided to threaten rain that afternoon.</p>
<p>It began with a cool breeze that made everyone cheer ... except the people that had been here before and knew what that cool wind was bringing. Then the thick fluffy clouds turned dark and there was a rumble in the distance.</p>
<p>Standing at the side of my tent watching the storm coming at us, I gave a sigh. If it rained I would have to put the tent back up at my house and let it dry out before storing it.</p>
<p>Olivia placed a hand on my bare shoulder drawing my attention to her. She gave me a small smile.</p>
<p>"Fireworks can have you trying to hide under the bed, but thunder and lightning ... I would have thought, if anything, that would be worse." She pointed at the storm with her chin.</p>
<p>I shook my head, and took a deep breath of the moist breeze. "No. It's different. Fireworks pop unexpectedly. The sound far too much like gunfire. And the smell like it too. That doesn't help." Turning I pulled her to me and looked down at her pretty face. "But storms remind me of heavy artillery. The range. The heavy rumble you feel in your chest and the way it seems to surround you in sound." I nodded my chin towards the distant thunder. "That's just the artillery boys testing some of their 105s or maybe a few of the 155s out at the range. It's almost comforting. Home-like."</p>
<p>"Giant popping explosions are 'home-like' but a string of firecrackers and a few bottle rockets is grounds for a padded room?" Olivia leaned in and a gave me a peck on the nose. "You are weird, big brother."</p>
<p>I nodded at the truth of that. "True." Looking at the speed the storm was approaching I made a quick decision. "I'm going to walk over to Robert the Pirates and have one last beer. I promised him I would try and drop by before we left and with tonight being the last night and packing out tomorrow it's liable to be too hectic later."</p>
<p>Olivia laughed. "That's likely to be one hell of an understatement. I've been watching the gate a bit today. It looks like I takes just as long to get out of here as it did to get in. And there are still a lot of people here."</p>
<p>I nodded agreement, even as I grabbed my hat and walking stick. "It is what it is. We will manage. But first, beer and pirates."</p>
<p>"Beer and pirates!" shouted Gloria from behind us. "That sound fun, I'm in."</p>
<p>So it was with that two beautiful women walking next to me, I set out on a mad quest through the storm-ridden desert for dark beer and recreation. Honestly that sounds better than we walked through the dust to get our drunk on before it rained.</p>
<p>We heard the big speakers at the Pirate's Paradise playing "Riders on the Storm" when we were still a good hike away. By the time we got there we realized it was on repeat.</p>
<p>Robert the Pirate saw us walk up and grinned. "Avast ya swabs, come to drink up all my booze again have ya? Well, good day for it. Bedamned if I want to have to pack out any of these kegs still full. Guinness all around, or will the lasses be drinking something else?" He already had his taps pouring one for me when he asked.</p>
<p>"IPA?" asked Gloria.</p>
<p>He gave her a look. "I ought to spank your bottom for drinking that bitter swill." Turning around he opened a blue cooler mostly full of ice. "I don't have any on tap, but someone left me a few dozen bottles of it when they headed out last night. I've got them iced down to the point ya might not be able to taste them." He dug a half frozen bottle out of one of the many coolers behind the bar. "Good enough?"</p>
<p>Gloria perked up and smiled. "Excellent. That's my brand!"</p>
<p>Robert made tisking sound with his teeth. "Weird girl." He slid the topped off pint of dark beer across the bar to me. "John ... here you go. And what for you, miss Olivia? I have hard cider ... ."</p>
<p>My sister almost jumped out of her short skirt. "Yes!"</p>
<p>Going back into the icy cooler he pulled out of frosty bottle. Popping the top her handed it to her with a flurish, then leaned on his bar. "Same as always. Last day I've got a dozen people dropping off every type of booze there is so they don't have to carry it home across state lines. I love it but I end up with some really strange stuff in stock."</p>
<p>The lighting that had been distant chose that moment to pop much closer. We all flinched a little. The heavy ruble rolled across the playa.</p>
<p>Robert shook his first at the sky. "Thor, you asshole, knock it off!" He looked at me and shook his head. "Damn vikings."</p>
<p>Chuckling, I held up my glass to that.</p>

<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>Robert looked up at the sky as it spoke again, shaking the whole city. "You know, back in 2014, there was a lady here got hit with lightning twice." At our shocked look he shrugged. "She was fine; they took her to the hospital to get checked out. Told her not to drink for forty eight hours." He gave me a grin. "Not sure she made it the whole forty eight."</p>
<p>I nodded my agreement at that. "Being hit my lightning is as good a reason to drink as I've heard of."</p>
<p>He nodded back "Truth. Y'all about packed up? Ready to try and head out right after the Temple burns to beat the crowd?"</p>
<p>Olivia took a small sip of her cider. "We're considering that very thing."</p>
<p>"Well, give it up. That ship has already sailed." He pointed his glass toward where the entrance was. "It's already a five hour crawl off the playa. And, if we get rain out of these clouds it will only get worse. I promise you. Don't expect to get out of here early from this point on."</p>
<p>"Lovely," I muttered, then shrugged. "It is what it is."</p>
<p>He grinned at me. "My life motto there, buddy. Ready for another one?"</p>
<p>Looking down, I saw to my surprise my glass was all but empty. Holding it up, I looked at the bottom. "I wonder if this one has a hole in it?"</p>
<p>Olivia half snorted cider.</p>
<p>At that moment three huge bolts came down, at least one of which must have hit inside the city limits. I found myself with two women hugging me tightly as the thunder shook us all.</p>
<p>Robert stood hunched over. "Well, folks, not to cut the shared libations short but this pirate is going to get under cover. I would suggest something similar till this blows over. Come back later, after the Temple burns, and we'll get rid of all this weird alcohol together. Deal?"</p>
<p>Nodding to the wisdom of that we all agreed and did a quick sprint back to camp. The wind was rippling the big Bedouin's canvas like a sail. Ducking from a close pop, we all ran in laughing.</p>
<p>"Were are the others?" Gloria asked. "Hello? Anyone in the tent?"</p>
<p>When there was no answer but thunder she turned and looked at my sister.</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>Olivia gave a small shrug. "I'm game for it?"</p>
<p>At my puzzled look, my sister grinned at me.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>I glanced back at Gloria who was suddenly really close to me.</p>
<p>Gloria bit her bottom lip. "John, I've got a confession. I've been hot for you since we all danced together."</p>
<p>Olivia spoke up. "Before then."</p>
<p>"Okay, before then." Gloria moved till she was touching my chest, lips mere inches from mine. " Um, since we've got the place to ourselves, how would you like to have some fun? The three of us. I mean, Olivia is your sister, sure, but I mean I'm sure she wouldn't mind being a little naughty with you too."</p>
<p>I glanced over at Olivia who looked like she was about to burst given the level of "naughty" we had already done this week.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm okay with a little naughty." Olivia moved till she was behind Gloria, making a sandwich cookie out of the little redheaded vegan. "Well, if you are, John?"</p>
<p>My sister caught the bottom edge of Gloria's thin top and pulled it up over the girls head. My eyes dropped automatically to those twin mounds topped with the sweetest looking pink nipples. "Um ... fine by me."</p>
<p>They both giggled. Gloria looked back at my sister. "I was sure we could talk him into it."</p>
<p>Olivia nodded. "Me too. You better kiss him before he chickens out on us, though."</p>
<p>Seconds later, my arms were filled with topless woman and my mouth was attacked by this sweet redheaded lady. It was with no reluctance that I allowed them to drag me into my enclosure. I was stripped in moments and they were both similarly naked seconds later. Tumbling into bed, the cool air rushing through the tent caught the small dust cloud that rose and blew it away. I was so thankful of that cold breeze. It's hot enough in this bed having sex with one woman. Two would have been like having sex in a sauna.</p>
<p>Given that when I built this bed I didn't ever picture a moment when it might have to stand up to three people having sex on it, I must say I'm surprised at how well it did. There was an ominous pop at one point that froze us all in our tracks. Gloria at that time was atop me, her incredible tight body gripping me with throbbing contractions of rippling pleasure, My sister was behind her also astride me, her thighs warm and wet as they slid across my knees.</p>
<p>Lying there allowing these two wild women to use me for their wicked enjoyment, and thus taking my own pleasure from them. I watched as my sister reached around Gloria and rubbed her clit. I felt those fingers move lower and caress me for a moment or two as her friend rode atop my cock. My hands rested on Gloria's thighs, but her breasts drew my attention as much as anything. When Olivia used both hands to press them together I lifted my back up off the bed and allowed my sister to feed me both of those nipples at the same time.</p>
<p>There was this perfect moment when I swear the thunderstorm was crackling and booming with our rhythm. It was wild to hear the sky rumble in sync with my thrusts.</p>
<p>Then the bed gave that ominous pop.</p>
<p>We all froze in place.</p>
<p>"Um, ladies, I think getting up really slowly is in order." I braced my hands on the side of the bed in the hopes of taking some of the weight and redistributing it.</p>
<p>Once they had stood up, I got up and bent down to look under. I couldn't see anything that seemed out of place. When I turned I found myself eye level with two gorgeous examples of the beauty of a naked woman at knee level.</p>
<p>Looking up, they both ginned at me, then Olivia said. "While you're down there."</p>
<p>With a naughty twinkle in my eye, I grabbed Gloria by her hips and pulled her into my face. There is a sweet spot just above a woman's hip. It is smooth, soft, hardly ever visible unless she is naked, and to my knowledge universally ticklish.</p>
<p>Gloria is not an exception.</p>
<p>As she eeked and squeaked and tried to get away, I got a solid hold on her as she spun around and buried my face into her butt. I placed a small bite on her butt cheek that made her jump and my sister giggle. I ducked under a playful slap as she got free and spun around to face me grinning up at her from my knees.</p>
<p>"Come here," I said after a second.</p>
<p>Gloria shook her head. "Not a chance, you tickle."</p>
<p>"Please."</p>
<p>She looked over at my sister. Olivia shrugged. "He did say please."</p>
<p>When she stepped in this time I leaned in and placed first one, then a second, then a dozen kisses atop her bare Mons. Licking her lips in appreciation, Olivia caught her and held Gloria steady as I lowered my exploration and placed a lingering kiss upon the wet entrance. She of course was heavily scented by the sex we had just been enjoying and the heavy scent was a powerful pheromonal perfume. I licked across her clit and Gloria gave a squeak that turned into a moan.</p>
<p>Looking up, I saw that Olivia had her hands firmly cupping Gloria's breasts while she kiss and whispered in the woman's ear.</p>
<p>Whatever my sister was saying it must have been pretty incredible since Gloria began to twitch and shiver under my licking. Her hand found the top of my head and pushed me deeper into her wet and open sex. I licked and kissed and even nibbled at everything there. Her fingernails at one point dung into my scalp almost painfully.</p>
<p>Looking up, I saw that Olivia was pinching Gloria's nipples, tugging at them.</p>
<p>With a small scream - that was muffled by her kissing Olivia -- Gloria gave an orgasmic moan that could have made a dead man wake up and pay attention. Shuddering, panting for breath, after a moment she stepped away from me.</p>
<p>I looked at Olivia's tightly trimmed up pubes and then up at her face and raised an eyebrow in question. She gave her head a small shake and gestured for me to stand up.</p>
<p>Getting to my feet was painful, but endurable.</p>
<p>My sister leaned in by Gloria's ear once more and after a moment the pretty woman nodded. They both them looked at me with hungry eyes.</p>
<p>"Your turn to cum, John." said Gloria reaching for my hand.</p>
<p>When I took it she used it to help her drop to her knees in front of me. I glanced at Olivia and watched her sink to her own knees next to Gloria. Two small slim hands reached around and cupped my butt. I was pulled forward a half step and then two sweet wet mouths came together on either side of my cock. Looking down, it was one hell of a sight watching them kissing with my cock between their lips.</p>
<p>Then their tongues began to play along either side of me and I lost the ability to think.</p>
<p>If I had not been lost in waves of pleasure I would have found it a bit amusing that the two of them started a competition to see who would be sucking on me when I finally got to my orgasm. Exactly how they were timing it I'm sure I don't know but they seemed to have a system worked out. Honestly, all I was aware of was the differences between the way they worked their warm wet mouths along me. Gloria was all bobbing head and suction. She had her fingers circling the base of me and would try to take enough of me in to kiss her own skin.</p>
<p>Now Olivia ... Holy shit my sister is giving me a blowjob ... again! My sister liked to take her time. A slow push down the whole length of my cock, while her hand cupped my balls, her thumb caressing the underside of my cock as she sucked and licked.</p>
<p>It was however in one of those moments when they went back to both kissing on either side that I felt my release build to the point of no stopping it. Placing a hand on each head I leaned back my head and growled a moan of pure lust as I slid myself between their pursed lips. I heard them giggle and felt Olivia's hand cup the end of me to catch my cum after the first spurt.</p>
<p>Then I was using them as supports to keep my week knee self standing upright.</p>
<p>Panting like a bellows I looked down, opened my eyes and saw them both smiling up at me. Olivia had a handful of my cum. With a grin she leaned forward a licked a bit from her palm. A shudder of lust rippled through me.</p>
<p>Looking up at a motion, I saw Tim -dressed in his black and gold cat suit again -standing in the partitioned-off opening, an amused look on his face.</p>
<p>He made a tisking sound of disapproval.</p>
<p>"Well, clearly you two ladies have no clue what you are doing down there if your man can stay on his feet. A properly sucked off man should be flat on his back and too weak to even move, let alone stand." He then shot me a wicked look, after a long look at my bare cum-oozing cock. "John boy, if you get tired of firing off shot in the minor leagues, give me a call and we bring you up into the major leagues of orgasmic fun."</p>
<p>He did a half turn then spun back around catching the two girls by surprise as they stood up.</p>
<p>Tim struck a pose worth of Rupaul. "Olivia! That is your brothers cock you were mouthing like a carp. What has gotten into you? And Gloria, girl I am shocked. You are a vegan and here I find you with a mouth full of meat."</p>
<p>"Army surplus, at that," said Kat from behind him. She glanced into my bedroom, saw the situation and shook her head. "Therapy people. All of you are in dire need of it."</p>
<p>Tim spun around, linked his arm into hers and walked off gossiping with her ... loudly ... about what he had walked in on.</p>
<p>My sister and Gloria were having a blush giggle fest while I stood there trying to breath and ... well, to simply breath, truth be told. After a moment Gloria leaned in close a and placed a kiss on my cheek.</p>
<p>"That was fun. Lets do that again some time." She gave my sister a naughty look, then a nod. I watched her bare ass as she walked out.</p>
<p>"Well?" asked Olivia.</p>
<p>"Well, what?" I asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>She gave a small huff. "How was it?"</p>
<p>"Absofuckinglyincredible." I grinned, then held out my arms. "Come here."</p>
<p>Olivia slid into my arms. "What?"</p>
<p>I placed a small kiss on her lips. "That felt wonderful. Thank you. And I love you."</p>
<p>"Do you?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>She smiled. "Forever?"</p>
<p>"Forever, and ever," I promised.</p>
<p>"Good." She gave me a longer kiss then I felt her wet hand at the small of my back. "That was yours. Sorry, but I didn't want to hang onto it any longer."</p>
<p>My lips pursed and my eyes went flat, as I felt cold cum run down into the crack of my ass. Olivia began to squirm in my arms trying to get away. When she wiggled free I had caught up her discarded flip flop from the carpet and - with a swing at her bare ass - chased her out into the main part of the tent.</p>
<p>She eeked and squeaked when I landed one pop on her right ass cheek. Then she ducked behind Kat who was making herself some lunch.</p>
<p>"Children, children!" Kat turned threatening us both with a soup ladle. "Don't make me use this."</p>
<p>Laughing, I pulled a flanking maneuver around the kitchen setup and my sister was left with only one choice, to either get her butt popped again, or to run out of the tent naked.</p>
<p>If at a future date stories are told of me running naked, chasing my naked sister with a shoe at Burning Man should ever crop up ... I will of course deny them. That I was being chased by a cat-suited gay guy with a yellow flyswatter is complete hearsay and will not be admissible.</p>
<p>Leaving my bike standing by the herd of other dusty playa velocipedes, I wandered into the Temple. There was less of a crowd here now than there had been, but given that this place would be on fire in a few hours that was to be understood. Most people had already come and left their messages, offerings, and prayers.</p>
<p>By the entrance was a sign saying the structure would soon be closed to visitors in order to get it ready to burn. A Temple Guardian nodded at me as I walked up, but tapped his wrist where a watch should be.</p>
<p>The number of photos and printed images that were tacked and stapled to the inside had doubled since I was here last. There was hardly a bit of bare wood that didn't have either an image or a message. Some were affirmations of intent. A desire to be sober. To keep fighting depression. A proud statement that this person had beat cancer. Or that, no matter what, they weren't going to let it beat them.</p>
<p>But far too many of the messages were goodbyes.</p>
<p>Goodbye to family, lovers, friends, ... self. Those hurt. They were tiny suicide notes hidden as inked prayers in a Temple destined to be ashes. And if that isn't life I don't know what is.</p>
<p>Hearing the crowd gathering, I was on the edge of leaving when my foot kicked something. Looking down I saw a black sharpie marker laying half buried in the dust. Why I bent down to pick it up I'm not sure. Leave no moop behind maybe. But as I stood back up my eyes lit upon a perfectly blank area of the Temple wall before me. How it could have been left uncovered with someone's scrawled prayers is beyond me.</p>
<p>It was the perfect place.</p>
<p>Eye level, and so obvious.</p>
<p>I stood there silently for a few moments. My mind pulling up memories of bloody faces. Sad images. Haunting remembrances of people now long gone.</p>
<p>Names.</p>
<p>So many names. Too many. Far too many.</p>
<p>Stepping forward I uncapped the marker and for a moment just breathed in that distinctive Sharpie smell. I pondered what I was going to write. What message would I want to leave here in this place, here on the last day. And how futile it was to put something here when it would vanish into flames in just a short time.</p>
<p>My hand moved of its own accord to write.</p>
<p>~ John Q - I wasn't done being friends with you guys.~</p>
<p>Stepping back, I looked at what I had written. Bit my lip. Nodded that it was perfect and let the marker drop into the dust at my feet, where I had found it. Who knows who else might need to find it before this building rose up into the night sky as sparks and smoke.</p>
<p>Walking outside, I toss my scarf across my mouth. There were now hundred of more bikes approaching and the dust they kicked up crossing the playa was making its own mini haboob that the wind was turning into dust devils that danced across the playa, Catching the last golden light of the sun peeking through the shredded clouds.</p>
<p>I stood and watched till I saw my sister and the others ride up on their bikes.</p>
<p>As I walked up to them Tim came flying in on his one wheel. A great cape of white silk billowing out behind him. His head wrapped in a turbin, complete with a sparkling jewel in the center of his forehead. The rest of him was covered in only bright pink body paint.</p>
<p>I gave him a smile. "Now that is a statement."</p>
<p>"Why thank you, hun." He wrapped the cape around himself. "It seemed a perfect way to be both modest demure and outstandingly provocative at the same time." He looked over at the others. "Jim, did you bring the basket? Oh good. I'm sure before the night is out all this smoke and dust will have me dry as sin. And I can not be have a dry throat, right Olivia?"</p>
<p>My sister who had been taking a sip of water, snorted it out of her nose.</p>
<p>Smiling at her blush, I took the bottle when she offered it to me and took a small sip to clear the dust.</p>
<p>"You got here early," she said, after a moment to clear her sinuses.</p>
<p>I shrugged and took another sip. "I didn't beat y'all by all that much. Took a walk around inside one last time." I made a gesture with my head toward the Temple. "Want to go?"</p>
<p>Olivia shook her head. Glancing around, I saw that Kat and Gloria were walking toward the entrance, but Tim and Jim had moved over to where a large group of guys was standing in the shade of an art car watching the sunset.</p>
<p>"Lets find a place to sit," She suggested after a bit. Looking towards the setting sun, she gave a shiver the temperature didn't warrant.</p>
<p>"You okay?" I asked.</p>
<p>She nodded. "Just too much sun. I fell like I've got fever chills."</p>
<p>I watched her rub at her arms. They were a good deal redder than when we arrived earlier this week. I knew from looking that she had some incredibly strange tan lines due to the many costume changes she had undergone this week. Finding a likely spot of desert floor to spread out a blanket on wasn't easy. We only had a few square miles to chose from after all.</p>
<p>Gloria and Kat came walking back up as we were sitting down.</p>
<p>"It's closed. They said they have to get it ready to burn." Gloria plopped down next to Olivia. "Wish I had come by earlier.</p>
<p>Kat circled around and sat down with her back to mine, using me as a prop to lean against. When I glanced back she smiled and said. "You make a great chair."</p>
<p>I shrugged and leaned back against her a bit. "Army surplus. Some minor damage from rough use while in service."</p>
<p>She chuckled.</p>
<p>Olivia leaned in against my side. "Hold me, I'm cold."</p>
<p>Putting my arm around my sister we watched the Temple turn golden in the last light. The music tonight was muted, but still omnipresent as it had been this whole week. In fact the whole of Burning Man seemed muted. Sure, a lot of people had left but the numbers were easily still in the tens of thousands. Off in the main city there were party camps starting their last rave of the week. There was a an almost frantic-ness to it that I had noticed. A quiet desperation to capture every ounce of this place that could be rung out in the last few hours.</p>
<p>But not here.</p>
<p>Here at the Temple people were gathering in small quiet groups. And as the sun sank these groups expanded, merged, and began to encircle the Temple. There was a lot of activity inside at the moment, and men in firefighter jackets were gathered by the entrances.</p>
<p>Sitting there watching the last golden light vanish into deep blues and purples, holding my sister, listening to the music I began to notice a man walking the circle around the Temple. An older gentleman, he was pausing at every group. Spoke for a moment, shook a few hands, hugged a few people ... then he moved on to the next group.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>Looking down at my sister, I gave her a tired smile. "Yeah, love?"</p>

<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"Can I really come live with you?" She looked away for a second. As if ashamed? "I asked you, and you said yes, but ... I'm always asking you for things, and mostly I don't even bother to see if you mind doing them for me, but I really can't help that. It's in my nature to want, and when I want I want things quickly. I tend to skip all the steps that most people call polite and I jump right to what I want." Olivia looked back at me with pleading eyes. "Call me greedy if you want, or self-centered, or a Veruca Salt, or any other thing that you can come up with but ... it's just the way that I am, John. You know that, you've been the shadow I've walked - "</p>
<p>"Olivia, shut up."</p>
<p>She looked at me blinking.</p>
<p>Leaning in, I kissed her softly on those beautiful lips. "Yes, I absolutely want you to come live with me."</p>
<p>"Really?" Her hand found mine.</p>
<p>"Really." I was about to say something else, but she surged forward into me and we both went backward, rolling past Kat's side over onto the blanket. With her kissing my face and me trying not to notice all the giggling going on around us, I caught her by her hips and - with a grin -- lifted her up and off of me. I held her squirming there for a moment then brought her back down for a kiss. Then back up she went.</p>
<p>"John, please stop bench pressing you sister." Kat reached over and tickled Olivia by her ribs, which made my sister squirm so much I nearly dropped her on top me me. "Children behave."</p>
<p>Lowering Olivia back down to my chest, I shared her grin as we sang in harmony. "That's what they say when we're together."</p>
<p>Tim plopped down next to us. "And watch how you play!"</p>
<p>Hugging Olivia to me, I whispered by her ear. "They don't understand ..."</p>
<p>She smiled and kissed me. " ... I think we're alone now"</p>
<p>A series of hands began to land on Olivia's ass, as Kat, Gloria, and Tim all joined in spanking her. With a squeal my sister jumped up off of me and darted away holding her butt. Gloria had also sprung up and gave chase. Giggling, the two girls ran a circle around a small group that soon joined in.</p>
<p>Sitting up, I rolled my way up onto my knees then levered myself up with a half-hidden groan. Brushing playa dust off my legs, I saw a pair of bare feet appear in my vision. Straightening up, I found myself looking into the eyes of the old man I had seen earlier.</p>
<p>He gave me a soft smile. "It's not your fault."</p>
<p>So simple of a statement. So incredibly simple. It hit me like a sledge hammer in the gut. Here was this man, who I didn't know, who was ... what? Forgiving me? Telling me that all the things that tear at me in the darkness were ... what? Not my fault? Or was he trying to get me to forgive myself? Could I ever do that? How could I do that when I was still aliv... .</p>
<p>"No," I shook my head. "No, I think it is."</p>
<p>He shook his grizzled head. "It isn't. Whatever it is, my friend, it isn't your fault."</p>
<p>"How can it not be?" I asked, almost pleading for an answer.</p>
<p>He took off his hat and brushed back his white hair. "We only do what the world gives us time to do. And, to do it to the best of our ability, is our responsibility in return for that time we are given."</p>
<p>Olivia slipped back under my arm and I looked down at her pretty face. There must have been something of the emotional turmoil in my heart showing on my face.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>The white haired gentleman looked at my sister and said. "It's not your fault."</p>
<p>Olivia looked at him for a moment, bit her lip and nodded. "It's not."</p>
<p>He smiled at her, then looked at me. "Listen to her. She understands."</p>
<p>As he moved on, I pondered that for a moment. Turning my sister in my arms till she was looking me in the eye, we shared a smile then simply stood there holding each other. Looking at each other's dusty faces.</p>
<p>"It's starting," said Tim standing up beside us.</p>
<p>Turning, my sister put her back to my chest and we watched them starting the first small fires at the edge of the Temple. Putting my arms together under her breasts I held her tight as the flames took hold and began to follow the wooden beams deeper and deeper into the heart of the Temple.</p>
<p>As the flames spread my sister hugged my arms to her belly. "Are you glad you let me talk you into coming here?"</p>
<p>I chuckled. "Yes. It's certainly been an interesting week."</p>
<p>She interlaced her fingers with mine. "It's not what I thought it was going to be. Not even close."</p>
<p>"How so," I asked.</p>
<p>She gave a small shrug. "I was expecting a twenty four seven party and that this desert would be like a giant beach. Get naked, stay drunk, and screw myself silly. It sounded like a plan."</p>
<p>I felt the heat of the fire began to touch my face, and the roar of the fire began to grow. "Um, I hate to point it out, sis, but you achieved a lot of that plan."</p>
<p>Olivia turned herself around to face me. "True, but I never planned to fall in love. And with my brother!"</p>
<p>A cheer went up as the flames reached something more flammable that wood within the structure and the fire raced up to the tall point in seconds.</p>
<p>When my gaze returned to my sister's face, I saw her eyes aglow in the firelight.</p>
<p>My sister reached up a hand and brushed my face. "I keep feeling like, at any moment, I'm going to wake up, back home, in my bed, and that all of this has been some weird vivid dream."</p>
<p>"A dream wouldn't have this much dust up our asses."</p>
<p>She laughed and hugged me. "True. So very fucking true"</p>
<p>Turning, we watched the flames eat away at the wooden Temple. The night winds taking the smoke and billowing it upwards in great rotating columns of reflected light and heat.</p>
<p>Beside us Tim shook Jim's shoulder and pointed. "Look, love, fire tornadoes!"</p>
<p>A cheer rose up above the roar of the flames as a small part of the Temple fell in on itself. Then another as an even larger section collapsed.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>I let my chin rest atop her head. "Yeah?"</p>
<p>"What will we tell Mom and Dad?"</p>
<p>I pulled in a deep breath of the smoky air. "That you decided that if you lived with me you could save a ton of money. And that I agreed because I need help in my furniture refinishing shop. Which I do by the way, consider yourself drafted."</p>
<p>She laughed. "Yes, sir."</p>
<p>I gave her ribs a poke. "Don't call me sir, I work for a living."</p>
<p>Around us the crowd began to sing. I listened but could not make out any words, so I mostly hummed along. Then, the more I listened to it, I came to understand that was what everyone was doing. Swaying side to side, my sister and I danced -- more or less- as the Temple burned. We cheered when the last of the structure collapsed into the inferno,, with a huge billow of sparks and fire-back-lit smoke.</p>
<p>The Temple Guardian's opened the circle and tons of people rushed forward to the huge pile of glowing flames. Most of our group I saw was was among them, but I caught my sister' wrist and pulled her to me. Looking up at me surprised, I smiled.</p>
<p>"I've seen enough burning piles of wood for one week. I want you."</p>
<p>Olivia, blushed but then looked excited. "You want me?"</p>
<p>Nodding, I tugged her towards where we had parked out bikes. "Yeah. Now."</p>
<p>"Wait." She pulled away, rushed to where Kat was sitting on the large drop cloth. After a moment of conversation Kat gave my sister the small blanket that was across her legs. In the fire light I saw Kat's eyes settle one me as Olivia rushed back to me.</p>
<p>"Follow me."</p>
<p>A bit puzzled but good to go with it, I followed her to our bikes, but then had to peddle hard to catch up with my sister as she headed in the opposite direction of our tent. With the cool night air rushing past my face, I chased Olivia's pretty ass as we headed off into the deep playa. Lighted art works stood like empty abandoned monuments to the insanity of this week.</p>
<p>Ahead of us, standing far out by itself I saw our destination. A giant kitchen table and chairs.</p>
<p>Rolling up beside it, I looked at my sister. She seemed incredibly gleeful.</p>
<p>"Good, no one is here." Looking back at me, my sister began to strip off the few clothes she was wearing. "Come on."</p>
<p>"We're having sex on this piece of art?" I waved a hand. "Why this one?"</p>
<p>Ignoring me, Olivia, now naked. Moved over to one of the big chairs and climbed it. She grabbed hold of the top of the table and pulled herself up with ease. Then standing there, her naked body illuminated by the lights atop the table, she looked back at me grinning.</p>
<p>"What, you can't tell me you never wanted to have sex on a kitchen table? Oh, but you are still so overdressed for dinner."" She pointed at her bike. "Get naked, and grab the blanket."</p>
<p>Laughing at the insanity of this, I stripped down and then tossed the blanket over my shoulder. The chairs were remarkably sturdy, and the table was as solid as a rock. Placed atop it, I saw were wooden plates and cups. Under them there were place mats carved into the wooden top on all four sides. In the middle of the table was a large beautifully carved and chromed serving platter ... with my naked sister lying atop it.</p>
<p>"Here I am, John. All yours; my ass served to you on a silver platter." Olivia rolled over onto her belly, wiggled her shapely butt at me, and looked back at me. "Hungry, big brother?" Her eyes looked me up and down. "I know I am."</p>
<p>Tossing the blanket down next to her, I eased my way down astride her thighs. Leaning forward I placed a kiss on the back of her neck, then a second under her ear making her shiver. "What made you think of this?"</p>
<p>Olivia squirmed under me, rubbing her bare ass against my cock and her back against my chest. "Gloria and I were here yesterday climbing up on it. There was a lesbian couple here talking about doing a sixty-nine on the platter. I wonder if they did?" She gave a squirm then pushed her ass back at my cock with a moan. "I had thought to try and drag Gloria here to have some fun, but this is better."</p>
<p>"Much," I mumbled through the kisses on her neck I was stealing.</p>
<p>Leaning back, I ran a hand between her ass cheeks and brushed my fingers along her labia. Olivia was soaked! Using a bit of that moisture and the leaking precum from me I had no trouble slipping into her pussy from behind.</p>
<p>"Umm, yes just like that."</p>
<p>My sister arched her body up to meet me as I slid across her thigh and slipped deeper with each thrust. She grabbed the side of the silvered serving dish and used that edge to push against, helping her to thrust back. Sitting up, I caught one shoulder and pulled her back to me.</p>
<p>Leaning my head back, I looked up at the stars overhead and that majestic visage suddenly brought home to me exactly how wild what I was doing was. I was not only in public, I was in ten feet off the ground on a giant table screwing my sister from behind, on a silver platter, while light bathed us from all angles giving a free show for anyone to see that happened to go ridding by.</p>
<p>And as the distant fire of the Temple shrank I saw more and more lighted bicycles beginning to cross the playa. Some in this general direction.</p>
<p>"Um, Olivia I do believe we might have company watching us here soon." I paused long enough to shift my leg a bit.</p>
<p>Her reply came in breathy pants. "I don't care. Let them watch. Harder. Don't you dare stop. I'll murder you if you stop. I swear!"</p>
<p>Sex and death threats. Well, that's new.</p>
<p>Settling back a bit, I pulled her up with me till she was on her knees before me. Olivia giggled when I pushed her head back down. That perfectly arched back created such and easy access I slid in an inch further than I had been making her gasp, then moan.</p>
<p>Keeping an eye out for wandering illuminated bicycle-riding, voyeuristic hippies, I gripped her hips tight and let every ounce of lust-driven need push me harder and harder. The conflict began to arise within me. I wanted this to last forever. I wanted to do nothing more in this world that this simple in out thrust that was bringing me and her so much pleasure.</p>
<p>Except ... I also wanted to cum. No, I wanted to explode!</p>
<p>And I could feel that explosion growing closer second by second. Deny it as I may.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and focused on anything other than the wickedly erotic sight of my sister' ass open and closing in a sexy wink before my lust-filled eyes. I felt the edge creep closer and tried to think of anything but how good this felt.</p>
<p>George Wendt in a pink tutu.</p>
<p>Robin Quivers on a pogo stick ... no, that's not helping.</p>
<p>Robin Williams on a pogo stick ... hell no, that's worse.</p>
<p>Mel Brooks talking to his donkey.</p>
<p>Donkey!</p>
<p>A long low moan from Olivia forced my eyes open. My sister pushed against the side of the silver serving plate driving herself up the length of my cock till I bottomed out balls deep in her. I felt my belly muscles tighten and my sack draw up. Panting for breath, I sensed movement and looked to my right.</p>
<p>There was a little woman - probably just this side of eighty, brilliantly lit in pink lights and not a stitch of clothes, beyond a feathered hat, to her name -- holding up her phone filming us.</p>
<p>"Oh, fuck..." I whispered even as I felt myself turn loose and empty into my warm wet sister. Olivia, her forehead pressed into the silvery plate, gave a small shriek of orgasmic pleasure as she felt me cumming inside her.</p>
<p>The little woman grinned at us, put her phone away, then applauded.</p>
<p>My sister collapsed onto the plate. Shivering and twitching. I think it was only then that she became awake that we had company. She gave a tired little waves that the old lady returned.</p>
<p>Still clapping, she called up to us. "That was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Honey, I know you just had a great time -and true we sacrifice for our art - but you're so going to get playa dust in you hoo-ha."</p>
<p>My sister tried to pull herself up a bit but fell back, She absently pulled the blanket over herself as she mumbled. "Been there, so done that already."</p>
<p>The little lady giggled, then her gaze shifted to me. Her eyes dropped to my wet cock glistening in the lights. I saw her bite the corner of her bottom lip, pulling the little wrinkles tight. "Young man, if I could get my butt up there on that table I would make you curl your toes and churn the buttermilk. Oh, well. Bye bye."</p>
<p>She peddled off into the darkness.</p>
<p>I dropped down beside on the plate Olivia and we laughed and panted for breath together. I pulled a bit of the blanket over me, the night was suddenly cold as hell. Olivia rolled over on her side, her leg draped across mine.</p>
<p>She kissed me, then burst into silly giggles. "Churn the buttermilk? I have got to remember that." Her hand ran down my stomach and cupped my soft cock and balls with her slender fingers. Her silky warm leg slid along mine. "So, lover ... how long till you can 'churn my buttermilk' one more time?"</p>
<p>Chuckling, I kissed the top of her head. "Give me a bit." I glanced over at the many more lighted bicycles now moving over the dark playa. "And do you think we could go some where with a bit more privacy?"</p>
<p>She moved, mostly sliding skin on skin till she was sitting atop me. She crossed her arms and rested her chin on the back of her hands, her face right at my chin. "No. I like my naked ass in the air."</p>
<p>I grinned. "Exhibitionist."</p>
<p>My sister gave a small shrug. "Only here. No one here judges." She gave a shiver. "Damn, it's cold."</p>
<p>I held her to me as she snuggled down on my chest. I tapped the table under us with my knuckles. "You know she thought we were part of the art."</p>
<p>Olivia nodded. "Maybe we should do that as an art project next year."</p>
<p>"Next year?" I asked, mostly to tease. I placed my hands on her bare ass and pulled her up me till our lips met in a kiss.</p>
<p>"Yeah, next year! I've had such a blast this week, there is no way I wouldn't want to come back next year. Besides Kimberly said she would get us tickets ... well, she said she could get me one if I drug you back to help her build. She really loved all the woodworking knowledge you brought to the Tower build." My sister wiggled her bare belly across my cock. I felt a stirring because of this. "So ... what do I have to do to get you to promise to come back here?"</p>
<p>Gripping her ass tight, I grinned. "Well, I can think of a few evil thoughts I've always had about you that we haven't done yet."</p>
<p>She blinked in surprise and sat up. "You've had evil thoughts about me?"</p>
<p>My eyes went to her nipples, so beautifully lighted by the art's upward illuminations. "More so this week than before, but yeah a few."</p>
<p>"How evil?" She gave a small pause then, I swear, blushed. "I mean by now you must know I'm pretty much up to try just about anything at least once, but ... well, kinky is fun but there have to be limits or it gets weird."</p>
<p>I just looked at her for a second. "You have your brother cum in you."</p>
<p>"Okay, weirder," she pouted. There was a small shrug. "I guess I just want to know what you have in mind."</p>
<p>My hand gripping her ass and I moved a finger over that tight swirl of pink between them.</p>
<p>"Oh!" She rose up a bit then, blushed again and settled back down. "Um, I've not done that. I mean, um I'm curious about it, and yeah I've tried a toy, but not the real thing. Back there I mean."</p>
<p>I nodded. "Then we can wait till we get home to try that."</p>
<p>"Oh, okay." Then Olivia gave me an odd look and asked. "Why wait till then?"</p>
<p>Sitting up, I moved till I was resting between her legs my thighs mostly under hers. I'm sure she could feel my hardening dick pressed against her. I leaned in a kissed her as long and as sensual as I could. My tongue met hers and we both ignored silly questions for the moment. However, when we finally decided to come up for air though my sister was insistent.</p>
<p>"Why wait till then?" she asked.</p>
<p>I gave her a naught grin back. "Because that way I can have you fresh out the shower and I can use my tongue to get you wet and relaxed."</p>
<p>Her eyebrows rose "Your tongue? Back there?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Against my ass?" she asked.</p>
<p>I shook my head. "No. In your ass. Or as deep as I can drive it in."</p>
<p>My sister gave a small shiver. Her hand moved between me and curled around my hard cock. "Um, you're kinkier than I thought, John."</p>
<p>"You have no idea."</p>
<p>With a roll of my hips -which hurt like hell, but who cares- I flipped us over on the plate and easily pushed myself back into my sister. Olivia gave a throaty moan that must have been heard back at camp, then looked at me wide eyed. A dozen emotions crossed her face all at once, but lust was brightest in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Please?" she begged.</p>
<p>Shifting my weight a little, I rose up on my knees and propped myself above her. Looking down in that sexy face I smiled as I felt her gripping me. Like fingers rippling along the length. I gave a thrust, then a second. Olivia moaned with each, squirming under me to get into a position to open herself more. Her eyes closed for a moment, but popped open when I stopped thrusting.</p>
<p>Leaning forward, I placed a soft kiss on her lips. "Take a deep breath."</p>
<p>Puzzled, I saw her give a mental shrug, then watched her breasts rise as she drew in a lungful of the cool night air.</p>
<p>My free hand went to her throat - catching her in a hard flat palm grip just under her chin - causing her eyes to flash wide in a moment's panic. I gave her a momentary smile, then taking my own gulp of air drove myself as deep and as hard into my sister as I could. Olivia's breasts jumped up the dropped back. A second thrust hard enough to all but hurt, made them bounce back again. That became my sudden goal to make them bounce higher each time.</p>
<p>I felt the moan under my hand that she couldn't give voice to.</p>
<p>Lifting myself up by my left hand, I kept most of my weight off the right hand on her throat. Braced in that position I could and did drive myself all the way into her with each thrust. After a minute of this she grasped at my wrist and I released enough that she took a gasping breath. Panting she gave me a nod and I applied a bit more pressure to her throat again. This blissful moment of shared control was repeated over and over for the next several minutes. Her demanding a breath then surrendering to being choked again once she got it.</p>

<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>Focused on this, I wasn't aware that our moving shadows were spreading out around us across the lighted circle of this piece of art. I'm not sure exactly what that must have looked like at a distance, but up close I'm sure it had to be trippy as hell.</p>
<p>Which must be what began to draw in the gathering of bikes and even a few art cars.</p>
<p>It was the sound of their motors which made me focus on something beyond the sexy sweaty face in front of me.</p>
<p>"Oh, shit..." I tried to say but had no breath to speak.</p>
<p>We were the sexually moving center of an ever brightening circle of multicolored lights. The art piece's own circle of lights showed me a few dozen happy faces all watching me and my sister.</p>
<p>Olivia opened her eyes and looked around then back at my face. "I don't care. Don't stop."</p>
<p>Nodding, taking my lead from her, I did my best to ignore the crowd and not let the distraction of cheers - and a few shouted comments on position and angle of thrust - interrupt what was one hell of a shared orgasm building between Olivia and I. She pulled at me, her nails scratching at my arms till I was laying atop her. Then my sister began to all but shred my back and, thus spurred, I made her scream with every thrust. She gave a great cry and went limp under me.</p>
<p>Several ladies in the crowd cheered her on.</p>
<p>Holding me tight to her, caressing me gently, Olivia began to whisper breathy encouragement by my ear "Cum for me brother. Fill me one more time. One more time in my pussy, and then when we get home you can cumin my ass. You want that, right? To take my virginity back there? To cum in my tight ass?."</p>
<p>If I hadn't cum earlier that little bit of naughty talk would have flipped my switch, crowd of onlookers or not. As was it took only a minute more of hard strokes inside her till I couldn't hold back any longer.</p>
<p>The rush and surge out of me this time was less, probably due to exhaustion or possibly a bit of dehydration .. it is a desert after all. I was all but weeping at the pleasure of finishing. I tried to hold my weight but my arms trembled and I gave into Olivia's silent promptings and let my exhausted self rest on her. She stroked the back of my head and cradled me to her breast for a few moments.</p>
<p>Around us there was a loud round of applause, then the table began to shake as others climbed the chairs and joined us atop it. I was helped to my shaky feet and given a dozen hardy pats one the back and shoulders. Olivia was helped up and then her face blushed like the sun at whatever one woman told her. We had to be helped to the ground and -with more than a few laughs- to our bikes. Getting dressed was a relief from the may eyes on my ass, but by the time I threw a leg over my bike and rode beside Olivia back to camp, I was all but stumbling.</p>
<p>Somehow we made it to our bed and tumbled into it together.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, tens of thousands of mentally and physically exhausted - but emotionally and spiritually happy - campers suddenly waking up and starting to break camp so they could get ready to leave makes more than a bit of noise.</p>
<p>I woke slowly. The comfortable weight and heat of my sister next to me all but lulling me back to sleep.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>My eyes popped open at Gloria's voice. "Yeah?"</p>
<p>"John, is Olivia with you. I'm about to head out and I wanted to say good bye."</p>
<p>My sister turned towards the curtain. "I'm awake. Come on in."</p>
<p>Gloria stepped inside, knelt down on the carpet next to the bed and gave my sister a hug. "I hate to leave. I wish the week wasn't over, but I am so tired, and so ready for a nice long shower and some time in my bed." She looked over at me and reached across Olivia to touch my bare shoulder. "John, it has been an absolute incredible time getting to know you, and I promise you ..." She gave me a grin. " ... the three of us will be getting together here real soon to have even more fun. Right?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely," I promised, with a grin.</p>
<p>Leaning in a bit, Gloria ran her hand down my stomach to where my morning wood rested pressed against Olivia's ass. She moved it around till it settled between my sister's ass checks then - with a smirk - gave Olivia a long kiss.</p>
<p>"Bye," she said after a moment just looking at us.</p>
<p>Olivia would have gotten up to hug her goodbye but Gloria waved her back down. My sister settled for saying "Bye Bye."</p>
<p>Turning over to face me, my sister and I looked each other in the face as we listened to the rest of our tent saying farewells to Gloria.</p>
<p>"I guess we need to get up," Olivia said, after the sound of Gloria's car faded. "I don't want to. I want to stay here forever. Just camp here till next year's Burning Man."</p>
<p>I gave my head a small shake. "With all the people gone, this place would be pretty lonely. You would be depressed and bored inside of two weeks."</p>
<p>My sister's hand moved between us and she grasped me tightly. "I'm sure I could find something to keep my spirits up."</p>
<p>With a chuckle I kissed her, then made a move to get up. She tugged me back down to her by my cock.</p>
<p>"This not ever going to be over between us, is it?" For a moment I saw a bit of fear in her eyes. "Not just the sex and the fun but you and I together like this?"</p>
<p>"Never," I promised.</p>
<p>My sister smiled at me. "Good, because I need you." She gave a chuckle. "Who else am I going to ask to do things for me? All those naughty, evil, wicked things I need done to me."</p>
<p>"Always my pleasure to help, sis, you know that." Leaning in, I placed a kiss on her nipple that made her moan and grip me tighter. "Now lets get up, eat something, and get this movable feast packed back into the van. I'm pretty sure it will take us all day simply to get out of here."</p>
<p>"Okay. You talked me into it." She gave me one last tug pulling me all the way down atop her. "But, only because I want to get to somewhere that has a shower. I have playa dust in my hooha."</p>
<p>Laughing, I caught her in a hug and had planned to turn us both over when the bed under us gave an almighty cracking sound. Then a loud pop. I had a half second to see her surprised face when the bed fell out from under us and dumped us both naked onto the carpet beside it.</p>
<p>"John? Olivia?"</p>
<p>There was a rush of feet and then the curtain was thrown back. Jim, Tim, and Kat were all standing there looking down on us. After a second they laughed.</p>
<p>Tim pointed a finger at us. "See, I told you. That weird chin sex y'all been doing done gone and broke the bed. And I swear you can't take a brother and sister anywhere these days without them ending up naked and in bed together. Am I right?"</p>
<p>Kay gave her head a shake. "Sure looks that way to me."</p>
<p>With a hand on his hip, Tim looked at Olivia. "Girl get your silly butt up, no one wants to see your naked boobies this morning." He shared a look with Jim beside him, then he glanced back at me. "Now you on the other hand, you handsome stud muffin, I must say we could look at you for a good bit longer. Tell me, John. Is it always that big and hard or are you just happy to see us this morning?"</p>
<p>Yep, one damn long week.</p>
