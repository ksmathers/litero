<p>Dedicated to all those who enjoy a little soapy fun...</p>
<p>Mark sat at his desk by an open window. The warm summer breeze drifted through as if attempting to lure him away from any intellectual pursuits. A series of books and one empty page of a notebook lay sprawled out before him. He tapped his pen against the blank white page, but the drumming of his writing instrument did little to distract him from his restless thoughts.</p>
<p>Although the new semester had already started, there was technically still a month left of the waning summer. Students everywhere were taking advantage of the late season weather to get in a few last days of sunbathing, swimming at the nearby lakes, as well as lots of backyard drinking. The parties were only just beginning to wind down. However, Mark spent most of his time indoors and buried in books, trying to sort things out for himself academically.</p>
<p>Mark's roommate, Trevon, strolled in and attracted his attention.</p>
<p>"Looking dapper!" Mark exclaimed, thankful for the brief interruption from his studies.</p>
<p>"Right?" replied Trevon.</p>
<p>He spun clockwise on the soles of his feet and fixed his collar, then gave his wrist a flick to show off his watch. Its shiny face briefly splashed a reflection across Mark's eyes. With a smirk, Trevon tucked his hands into the pockets of his pants and struck a quick pose, as if strutting on a red carpet for the paparazzi.</p>
<p>"Gotta look sharp, you know? Looking to start a little somethin' with Shayna..." he added.</p>
<p>"Do it, man. You got this," Mark said with a grin. They fist-bumped.</p>
<p>"You sure you don't wanna come?" Trevon asked, letting his jaunty pose soften suddenly.</p>
<p>"Naw, I'm gonna get some work done. I'll probably get some dinner at the Canteen. Maybe I'll stop by later, I dunno."</p>
<p>Mark wasn't interested in letting on about his true state of mind. As a transfer student, he was still trying to find his way. Freshman year back in Chicago had not gone so well. He couldn't decide which classes to take or which circle of friends to join. Worse, the city itself simply created too many distractions. He finally came to the decision that his indecisiveness was the result of the school not being the right fit, so he went elsewhere.</p>
<p>Halfway through the school year he transferred to Mount Wilson University, a rural liberal arts institution surrounded by the Central Mountains of Vermont, which promised him a uniquely beautiful environment, terrific skiing in the colder months, and a greater ability to focus on big decisions he would soon have to make about the course of his life. Taking the place of Trevon's equally confused ex-roommate, Mark had just enough time to inherit a new circle of friends before summer break, during which he worked as quickly as possible to get some sense of direction with his studies.</p>
<p>"Well, suit yourself," Trevon sighed, before returning a spring to his step. "Wish me luck!" he then exclaimed, his lips starting to curl at the edges.</p>
<p>"We both know you don't need it."</p>
<p>Trevon laughed. "Well, you know how it is... You got no advantage out here in Vermont. Folks like me are still a novelty around these parts!"</p>
<p>Mark laughed as he watched his roommate head out of the room with a swagger he wished he had himself.</p>
<p>As much as Mark suffered from academic indecisiveness, the same was not true about girls. He knew in an instant who he liked, who was right for him, and whether he was right for her. And that girl's name was Brooke.</p>
<p>Trevon had introduced them during just his second day on campus. Ever since then, she'd been winding her way deeper and deeper into his subconscious. Brooke was effortlessly confident, exceptionally intelligent, and commanded attention the moment she entered a room. Mark was in awe of the way she didn't seem the least bit daunted by most things. He wanted to get to know her better, to connect on every level, to be the one person she revealed her deepest thoughts and feelings to.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Brooke was also taken.</p>
<p>As dinner rolled around, Mark wandered down the path through campus that led to the Canteen where students from all over often congregated for dinner. He had somehow worked himself up into a semi-productive state and was anxious to end his study session on a high note.</p>
<p>Mark's tray landed on the counter with a loud slap, then he slid it along the various protein options laid out across the salad bar. After loading his plate up with food, he made his way to the wide-open seating area to scan for anyone he knew. He heard laughter; familiar laughter, which echoed across the room to greet his ears. In an instant, he knew who it belonged to. Brooke was seated nearby at the end of a table, sharing a meal with several of their classmates.</p>
<p>Mark observed her as he approached; bold, confident, and headstrong. As she completed the punchline of an amusing anecdote, Brooke's eyes darted over to catch his arrival. As the laughter died down, so too did her vivaciousness. Mark often enjoyed observing her from afar, because she had recently developed a tendency to slip into a self-conscious, quieter state the moment he arrived. Room was immediately made for him and the mutual friends he shared with Brooke welcomed him to the table.</p>
<p>Brooke was highly spirited, tall, and slim, with a beautiful smile and piercing blue eyes. Her hair was dark underneath, giving way to a thin outer layer that crossed through the full spectrum of blonde, just barely reaching a pure golden state at the surface as it reached the sunlight. Mark loved the fact that she was a little bit intellectual, a little bit free-spirited hippie, and a little bit goofball, all wrapped into one. Strangely, Brooke was inexplicably tied up with John Maguire, a frat guy that acted as arrogantly and entitled as he was undeservedly good-looking. This relationship didn't seem to jive with everything else Mark knew about Brooke, and he couldn't understand it. But Mark was patient and he counted the days until he had his chance with her.</p>
<p>"That's funny!" his classmate Gavin was saying. "I'd like to see him try to do the same thing at one of the Washings!" Mark's female classmates started to laugh.</p>
<p>"Oh! That reminds me--" Brooke interjected. "Is everyone else Washing? Ours is on Wednesday." She briefly glanced in Mark's direction but quickly looked away the moment he noticed.</p>
<p>"I'm going with Melody at James' place," someone chimed in.</p>
<p>"We're both going to Matt's," said some others.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to anyone's this week-- but I'll be at the one on Friday!" added another.</p>
<p>Mark began to eat, listening to his friends excitedly respond to Brooke about their plans for something during the week ahead. It was all lost on Mark. He assumed it must be some school tradition he had missed freshman year. He couldn't help but feel that there was a lingering expectation that he'd offer his own answer to Brooke and she seemed strangely disappointed that he remained silent.</p>
<p>"I don't have one yet, can I join you guys?" Crystal asked.</p>
<p>"Sure! Are you bringing Adam?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Thanks!"</p>
<p>"Awesome! There are about a dozen of us so far, then," Brooke explained.</p>
<p>Mark began to feel left out, being clueless about the matter, but didn't want to reveal his ignorance in front of the group, so he remained quiet until the conversation turned to other matters and he could join in. The mysterious discussion about the Washing had successfully gone in one ear and out the other, and he soon forgot all about it.</p>
<p>Monday morning gave way to afternoon and Mark soon hit a wall. Feeling the lack of energy kick in, he made his way to the campus coffee shop to grab another pick-me-up before his next class. He approached the barista.</p>
<p>"Large black coffee, please," he mumbled.</p>
<p>"Hey Mark," said a soft voice from behind. He turned around and felt the instant, awkward tingle of sexual tension. Brooke was standing directly behind him with a slight smile.</p>
<p>"Oh! Hi Brooke. I-- uh... was just getting a coffee. Can I get you something?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" she explained. "The same."</p>
<p>"Make that two," said Mark. The barista nodded.</p>
<p>"Thanks. That's sweet of you," Brooke said.</p>
<p>"No problem," said Mark, stepping to the side to await their order. There was nervous silence for a few moments.</p>
<p>"So..." said Brooke, "How's your day going? Err... morning."</p>
<p>"I tripped over myself trying to get my pants on and naturally missed landing on my mattress by a good six inches. Which, of course, is why I'm here getting coffee. -- Honestly, not that bad for a Monday!"</p>
<p>"At least you remembered to put them on at all!"</p>
<p>They both started laughing. Mark was relieved the tension broke slightly and they might soon find themselves in the normal flow of conversation.</p>
<p>"Two large black coffees," said the barista, passing them to Mark over the counter.</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>Mark handed Brooke her coffee and they strolled over to the window together to stand at a small counter. He noticed that Brooke seemed to be negotiating something in her head.</p>
<p>"By the way," she said, apparently deciding to go through with whatever she had been hesitantly considering. "I don't think I actually heard your answer last night at dinner... Have you joined a group for the Washing yet?"</p>
<p>The conversation he'd overheard the evening prior came flooding back into his mind after he had since forgotten all about it. He found himself just as unprepared to comment on the topic that they discussed.</p>
<p>"What is that, anyway?" Mark asked. "I remember you talking about it with everyone else, but I actually have no idea what the Washing even is..."</p>
<p>Brooke suddenly lowered her coffee from her lips and widened her eyes. "Really?!" she exclaimed, genuinely surprised.</p>
<p>"Yeah... I guess I missed the boat on that," he replied with mild embarrassment. "Being a transfer student is weird," he admitted. "I feel like I'm clueless about a lot of stuff."</p>
<p>"Oh, right..." said Brooke, trailing off into a strange silence.</p>
<p>Mark wondered if he'd done something wrong, as Brooke began to shift nervously. He raised an eyebrow. Now he was suddenly curious what the Washing was all about, given the way she was acting.</p>
<p>"It's not a secret or anything, is it?" he asked nervously.</p>
<p>"Oh! No... it's just... I wasn't prepared to explain..." Brooke laughed nervously at herself as if embarrassed that she was showing any sign of anxiety in front of him. Mark was more than conscious of the fact that she seemed increasingly not herself around him. He watched her face as it turned a slightly rosy color. She stared down at her coffee for a moment, before taking a decisive and sudden look directly into his eyes and offering her explanation.</p>
<p>"So-- the students at Mount Wilson have this annual ritual, toward the start of each school year. It... uh... I don't know how to explain..." she began. Mark waited patiently with a nervous smile forming on his face. "You know how some schools hold an annual naked run? When everyone streaks through the library or through campus or something?"</p>
<p>Mark gulped. The butterflies immediately started swarming in his gut. Mark had seen the videos... He nodded to her.</p>
<p>"Well, this is our version... basically. Only it's more like a big group bubble bath, I suppose." She gave a nervous laugh and looked down at her coffee again. If it weren't for the fact that what she had just told him was so shocking, he would have been able to dwell on how beautiful she looked casting her eyes downward with the small strands of hair gently falling over her eyes.</p>
<p>"Wait... You mean... How does that work?" he sputtered.</p>
<p>Brooke looked up at him in amusement, catching the look of bewilderment on his face. She seemed suddenly less embarrassed having seen his astonishment. The more he grew disoriented, she grew bolder.</p>
<p>"It's okay, I reacted the same way when I first heard about it," she laughed.</p>
<p>Mark began to chuckle nervously. "Yeah... but seriously though-- come again?!"</p>
<p>She grinned. "It's been going on for decades. We fill up buckets of water, get some soap and sponges, and hold a big bathing ritual where everyone scrubs each other down after reciting a series of affirmations."</p>
<p>"Affirmations?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. We purge everything we don't want to take into the new school year from the previous one. You know... bad grades, failed relationships, et cetera. It all gets washed away in a cleansing. Both physically and emotionally." Mark stared at her incredulously as she explained, trying to picture such a scene in his head. She continued, "Everyone holds their own Washings with their friends during the week. Then, at the end of the week, the whole school gets together on campus to hold one final mass Washing together, and we celebrate starting the year fresh."</p>
<p>"But... do you, like, wear bathing suits... or?" he asked, finding himself beginning to tremble.</p>
<p>She laughed and shook her head. "Um... no. I said it was sorta similar to a naked run... remember?"</p>
<p>"Oh... right..." said Mark, suddenly realizing he was revealing his nervousness to her. She gazed at him with a curious, amused expression, as if she found his embarrassment adorable. He felt himself panicking, developing the need to say something to get past his dumb question. "You're brave to go nude. I'm sure all the guys are more than eager to ogle," he added. "Doesn't that make you uncomfortable?"</p>
<p>She took another gulp of her coffee. "Sometimes..." she said with a shrug. "But usually not. Besides, as much as the guys enjoy seeing the girls naked, I think they're more uncomfortable about being nude than we are."</p>
<p>"Really?" he said, surprised to hear her say that.</p>
<p>Brooke put her coffee down and waved her hands in front of her as if she was about to explain something important. She had that feisty, philosophical air about her that Mark loved so much. Whenever there was potentially a debate to be had, she got like this. The problem was, she was always so sensible that Mark was left nodding dumbly in agreement, too much in awe of her to add anything to the conversation.</p>
<p>"Yeah-- see, here's my theory," Brooke started. "The guys? They put on a big show, but they're actually incredibly insecure about getting naked due to the risk of being caught standing there in front of all the girls, standing right beside the guy with the bigger dick." Mark chuckled. "Which, of course, is absolutely ridiculous," she added, rolling her eyes. "But that's just how guys are."</p>
<p>Mark nodded.</p>
<p>"Now the women, on the other hand... society holds us to a higher standard of physical attractiveness. We're constantly under a microscope. Constantly being judged, rated, criticized for our bodies. We're made to feel shame all the time, so we end up taking fewer risks. The free expression of ourselves, the ability to be open about our bodies, to celebrate who we are and what we look like without being judged, shamed, called a slut... that's an avenue frequently closed off to us."</p>
<p>"Right," Mark said.</p>
<p>"But not during the Washing," Brooke concluded. "Every year us women can come together in support of one another and take charge of our bodies, to reveal them without shame. It becomes a source of pride in our womanhood. It's freeing to be naked together in public. It's cathartic. For a lot of us, it's the one moment where we can finally let go and purge ourselves of the constant struggle we undergo on a daily basis."</p>
<p>As usual, Mark found himself admiring her insights.</p>
<p>"To see all of humanity as the same-- naked, insecure, vulnerable... That's a healthy, humbling experience for everyone to have once in a while. Somehow, in doing so, one ends up feeling safe in our mutual embrace of the challenge. It gives us all a way to move forward together."</p>
<p>Mark was smitten. Brooke was everything he wanted in a woman: thoughtful, capable, witty, beautiful, the whole package. His fierce attraction cursed him with an embarrassing silence until he finally broke it with a meager statement. "That makes sense. I think it's great that you've embraced it then."</p>
<p>She smiled and nodded at him. For a moment, she appeared to be studying his face. His stomach was in knots.</p>
<p>"Anyway... um..." she continued, suddenly self-conscious of the fact that she'd just launched into an unexpected speech, "You're welcome to join us... for our Washing." Her nervousness seemed to be making a return.</p>
<p>"Oh... thanks--"</p>
<p>"It's on Wednesday. Just show up at around five o'clock."</p>
<p>"Okay... where is it?"</p>
<p>"D'oh, right-- it's at John's. At his frat house in the backyard..."</p>
<p>"Ah, okay," Mark said. The conversation was fully awkward again and his heart was racing. But why wouldn't it be? The girl he had a major crush on just asked him to join her at an event where they would take off all their clothes together and see each other naked. His body was surging with a complex mixture of raw arousal and intense fright.</p>
<p>"I'll see you there?" Brooke asked as if seeking proper confirmation.</p>
<p>"Yeah, absolutely," Mark said, still trying to recover.</p>
<p>"Great," she said with a small smile. "I'm looking forward to seeing you."</p>
<p>"Likewise," he said, returning the smile. He hoped that her admission was a Freudian slip and that the word "naked" belonged at the end of her statement.</p>
<p>"Okay... Um... I'd better get going before I'm late for class."</p>
<p>"Okay, go for it."</p>
<p>"See you later, Mark!" she said, smiling happily. She offered him a quick wave as she rushed out.</p>
<p>Mark waved back. The moment she exited he found the nearest seat and collapsed into it.</p>
<p>Mark made his way to Environmental Science, his first class of the day, and took his usual spot. Sipping on the last remnants of his coffee he watched the slow trickle of students file in, full of glazed looks and unwashed hair. After his earlier exchange with Brooke he found himself still coming down from a high; the potent mixture of hormones and caffeine. Mixed into the dispersing crowd he caught sight of Natalie, a mutual friend he shared with Brooke.</p>
<p>Natalie cast him a look from across the room and hurried toward him with her usual look of mild amusement. Mark always found her fun to be around. She was petite and feisty, with a raspy voice and a wisecrack perpetually at the ready. Natalie wore an old black t-shirt with a large yellow warning sign that read, "Slippery when wet." Her upper ear glistened with a row of piercings and her long, dark hair featured a vague ribbon of purple still lingering from a passing summer fancy.</p>
<p>"Hey there hot stuff," she chirped as she threw her bag down on the floor and collapsed into the seat beside Mark. She always had a twinkle in her eye when she saw Mark, but it was easy to dismiss. Natalie was just the type to flirt sarcastically with everyone.</p>
<p>"Hey, what's up?" he replied.</p>
<p>Natalie drew a long, deep sip from her own paper coffee cup as if inhaling it, then rocked her head to the side casually. "I didn't do the reading for class today," she admitted with a grimace.</p>
<p>"You didn't miss much..."</p>
<p>"I was up at Ryan's. He had some tasty cakes left in his stash and we finished it all off," she laughed as if recalling some inside joke.</p>
<p>"Oh, cool." Mark wondered where she got her infinite supply of energy first thing in the morning, always ready to babble excitedly about the events of her previous night or the latest gossip, as if she was already on her fourth coffee.</p>
<p>"Brooke was supposed to come but John held her up, and then she just bailed on me."</p>
<p>"Ah," Mark added with a grimace.</p>
<p>Natalie started laughing. "I know THAT look..."</p>
<p>Mark smirked. "What look?"</p>
<p>"Well..."</p>
<p>"Well nuthin'. I know you've got it bad for her."</p>
<p>"Really?" Mark said, surprised he was apparently so transparent.</p>
<p>Natalie shot up straight in her seat, turned to face him squarely, and said with a mocking seriousness, "I don't know much about a lot of things, but I know pretty much everything about who likes who." She relaxed back into her seat and took another swig of coffee.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>"Well, I guess it doesn't really matter."</p>
<p>"Why, because of John?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Actually," replied Natalie, with a slightly sinister grin forming on her face, "I guess I can say this, 'cuz it's public knowledge now. But asshat John has been cheating on Brooke for, like, months now."</p>
<p>"Wow, really?" answered Mark, becoming suddenly alert. "With who? Does she know about it?"</p>
<p>"That bitch Jenna Coleman. All the frat guys share her pussy, basically. -- Yeah, of course she knows. She's known for a little while now."</p>
<p>"Huh." Mark decided not to press her for more details, out of respect for Brooke.</p>
<p>"Yeah, so you might have a chance with her soon enough..."</p>
<p>"Is she breaking up with him?"</p>
<p>"I mean... I dunno. But I sense a disturbance in the Force with her. I don't think it'll last much longer, now that the cat is out of the bag." Natalie seemed pleased with herself for having delivered the delicious news, especially to someone she knew had the potential to replace Brooke's current boyfriend, whom she despised. "Oh!" she exclaimed, suddenly having an idea. "You should ask her if you can join her group for the Washing! She'd totally let you come... I'll be there!"</p>
<p>"Oh, actually she already invited me. Just this morning."</p>
<p>"Oooh, that's a good sign," Natalie replied, clapping her hands together. "Do you have a partner yet?"</p>
<p>"I wasn't aware I needed one..." said Mark, surprised.</p>
<p>"Of course. Do you want to be my partner then? I still need to find one."</p>
<p>"Sure... What exactly does that mean, though?" Mark grew mildly nervous at the growing realization that he was really about to take part in some naked shenanigans, and that Natalie would also be present.</p>
<p>"Well, you need a partner to share a bar of soap and a bucket with. Who'd wash you, otherwise?" she answered with a wicked grin.</p>
<p>Mark laughed. If there was one person he wasn't surprised to see so eager about the prospect of such an episode, it was Natalie. "Okay, I think I get it. So... we literally wash each other? Like..." He was hesitant to believe he really understood the full details of what was going on.</p>
<p>"Yup!" she replied, happily.</p>
<p>"And you'd be okay with that?" he asked, still in disbelief that she was asking to interact with him in the nude.</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. "I wouldn't have asked you if I wasn't."</p>
<p>"Okay," Mark said with a smirk.</p>
<p>"I mean, chill! It's not like we're going to the prom or anything," chuckled Natalie as she finally began to unpack her books and arrange them on her desk. A grin began to spread across her face. She added, in a somewhat softer tone, "I'm merely asking you to put your hands all over my naked body."</p>
<p>A sudden laugh forced itself up Mark's throat and he almost choked on it. Just then, the teacher walked in and everyone began to quiet down. Mark continued to gaze at Natalie in bewilderment.</p>
<p>She sat face forward, ready for class, with the wicked smile still lingering on her face.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon Mark strolled into his dorm room and threw his bag onto his bed. Trevon sat in the corner tapping away at his smartphone. Mark gave him a swift punch in the shoulder, causing his roommate to almost drop the device.</p>
<p>"Ow!" said Trevon with a wince. He rubbed his shoulder.</p>
<p>Mark smirked. "Why didn't you tell me about the Washing?!"</p>
<p>Trevon started laughing. "Actually, I was going to. Shayna and I are going over to Anthony's tomorrow for one and I was gonna see if you wanted to join us." Mark hadn't had a chance to get the update on how things had gone with Shayna, but clearly they'd gone well. "I think Kate needs a partner still," Trevon added. "Do you wanna join us? You can maybe go with her."</p>
<p>Mark walked back to his bed and took a seat at the edge of the mattress. "I'm taking Natalie to Brooke's."</p>
<p>"Wait," said Trevon, with a look of mild confusion. "Isn't Brooke the one you like?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but she's going out with John still."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah... that asshole," Trevon mumbled, turning back to his phone.</p>
<p>Mark was silent for a few moments. He was feeling a range of emotions. He felt confusion over an event that was still obscure in his mind. What was it like? Did everyone really just get naked together? Did they really touch each other's body? He felt dizzy with a mixture of excitement and extreme anxiety about seeing Natalie take her clothes off in front of him. What would she look like, and ow would she react to his own body?</p>
<p>But most of all, he felt a rising terror at the prospect of stripping down completely with Brooke nearby. He'd imagined her naked a thousand times, but never in a scenario quite like this. In his fantasies it was always just the two of them; together, desirous of one another, ready to share a moment of extreme intimacy. Mark still couldn't quite process the unbelievable fact that he'd finally get to see her body in all its glory, nor how cruel it was that she'd be with John and not with him.</p>
<p>"So... Shayna, eh?" said Mark, in a desperate attempt to block these thoughts which exhausted his mind and emotions.</p>
<p>Trevon put down his phone and looked up at him with a grin.</p>
<p>Tuesday came and went without much discussion of the upcoming event, mostly because Mark's anxieties about it prevented him from bringing up the topic too often. However, at lunch he overheard someone excitedly mention a Washing that was taking place later that day. There was a mild buzz in the air, covert looks, giggles, and whispers, which Mark assumed were all related to Washings that had just taken place, or were about to happen.</p>
<p>As the day wore on the butterflies in his stomach steadily grew. He remained on high alert, watching out for Brooke wherever he went, but he never bumped into her. It left him feeling panicky, like he wanted to at least run into her to confirm that this was really happening, that she had really invited him to an event where they'd see each other naked. He wanted to see her boldly facing the task, if anything just to help him feel less insecure about it.</p>
<p>By Wednesday morning his nervousness and excitement reached a fever pitch. He passed Natalie in the halls twice and both times she made a show of what they were going to do together later that afternoon. "Ready for your scrub?" she asked with a wink as she passed by. Later, she used her favorite phrase with him, "See you tonight, hot stuff."</p>
<p>Knowing what lay ahead for the two of them, Mark found that he could no longer look at Natalie without imagining her completely nude. He remained hard for a long period of time after their transient encounters, his arousal being maintained by a near hallucinogenic sensation of her soft hands rubbing themselves curiously all over his naked body. He tried to talk himself down, hypothesizing that it wouldn't really be that erotic, that they would end up just laughing a bit and splashing each other with soap and water, carrying on, pointing, and making wisecracks.</p>
<p>As the afternoon approached he had the urge to flee, but knew he'd never bail on Natalie, nor miss a chance to see Brooke naked for that matter. As four o-clock neared four-thirty and then rounded the clock toward five, Mark began to make his way across campus toward the frat house where John lived, where it would all finally go down. He began to wonder if he should have given himself a fresh trim or any other last minute preparations to make sure that his naked body was as presentable as possible for a bunch of girls he knew and one he was head-over-heels for. Distracted, awkward thoughts plagued his mind right up until he finally reached the old brick building, behind which he could hear a low thumping of music and laughter.</p>
<p>Mark walked around the corner of the house toward the backyard and the music grew louder. When he reached the other side he found a small crowd of people hanging around holding plastic cups filled with beer. There were a few couples he recognized. He spotted John in a t-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops, as well as several of his frat brothers and their girlfriends. The yard was decorated sparsely with globe lights and a long table had been set up with snacks and stacks of napkins, as well as much to drink. A couple of the girls standing near John and his friends already looked drunk, dancing and grinding sarcastically against the guys who watched them with wide grins. Other couples looked on, observing nervously with their arms folded and hands tightly clutching their cups.</p>
<p>Mark saw little to do with the ritual that was about to take place until he approached the table for a drink. On the other side, near a sliding door leading into the house, he spotted a small grid of seven or eight light blue buckets filled with water, one for each couple in attendance. Inside each bucket he noticed a dull, mustard-colored sponge floating there, vaguely in the shape of a large peanut. A jumbo bar of soap sat in the grass in front of each one. Beside them all the hoses were pulled out, lazily curled like snakes basking in the afternoon sun.</p>
<p>Mark retreated from the table and wandered over to the small crowd, taking a brief sip of beer and looking for the faces he recognized.</p>
<p>"Mark!" shrieked Natalie, arriving out of nowhere. She skipped over to him, briefly splashing her beer.</p>
<p>Mark grinned. "Hey Natalie!" he exclaimed, his heart suddenly thumping.</p>
<p>Natalie finished bounding over to his side. She wore tight denim shorts, frayed at the edges, and a black t-shirt sporting the logo for an '80s hair band. It was obvious from the spring in her step that she hadn't bothered to wear a bra. The loose movement of her two small breasts mildly obscured the text on her shirt, bending inward to a shallow channel between them. In fact, everyone present appeared to be wearing simple, loose-fitting clothes that could be easily removed.</p>
<p>"You didn't chicken out!" she squealed, wrapping one arm around him and squeezing him tightly as her beer hovered by his head in her other hand.</p>
<p>"Are you kidding me?" he laughed. Mark sarcastically sized her up. "I've been dreaming of this moment since I first met you!"</p>
<p>Natalie threw her head back and erupted into mad laughter. "You and me both!" she exclaimed. Natalie tugged his hand over to a nearby couple to introduce him. They began to mingle and Mark's nerves started to calm slightly, thanks to the social distraction.</p>
<p>Moments later the sliding door across the yard opened and Brooke stepped out into the sunlight holding a bowl of pretzels for the table. She was wearing a pair of white shorts and an army green bikini top. Brooke seemed mildly stressed at the responsibilities of being a good host while John hung out with their friends. There was an explosion of sudden laughter. She looked up and laughed at the antics of some friends nearby, then glanced casually across the yard. Upon spotting Mark she stopped short. Brooke's smile quivered a little as she fell silent.</p>
<p>"Hey," Mark silently mouthed in her direction. She responded in kind, her smile freshly renewed. Brooke then turned back toward the house and vanished inside. Mark returned to the flow of conversation, each of them musing about their summertime escapades, which lasted for several minutes until John grew restless.</p>
<p>"Dude, it's past five already! Let's get this party started!" he exclaimed. "Someone get Brooke..." He raised his hands to his mouth and aimed them toward the house. "Brooooke!" he shouted.</p>
<p>Hearing her name, she stepped out of the house. "Shit! The affirmations!" she shouted before turning abruptly around and darting back inside. Moments later she ran back out holding a piece of paper, switched off the music, and hurried over to join everyone, wiping aside the strands of hair that clung to her forehead.</p>
<p>"Whew, okay..." she mumbled with a laugh. "Thank you everyone for coming to our Washing!"</p>
<p>The small gathering around Mark began to cheer loudly and he joined in. Natalie stood beside him raising both arms in the air, holding her beer triumphantly aloft and unleashing a loud, "Whoooo!" She turned to Mark and they chuckled.</p>
<p>Brooke continued, "Most of you know how this goes, but I know that some of you haven't done it before, so I'll just explain how it works." She glanced briefly at Mark. He knew she was referring to him, and probably only him. "I'm going to read the affirmations first and everyone will respond. Then one of you will go over and grab a bucket of water and a bar of soap and bring it back to your partner so we can get started. We've got a bunch of towels that I'll bring out later, if the sun doesn't dry you off first."</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and looked down at the sheet in front of her. "Okay! Here we go..." The crowd quieted down and everyone faced Brooke, listening attentively as they finished the last sips of their beer. Brooke began to read from the piece of paper.</p>
<p>"We gather here today to expunge ourselves of the mistakes of our pasts, to rinse our minds of the things that trouble us and to wash away the memories of past failures. As we cleanse our bodies, so too are we cleansing our minds, our emotions, the negative thoughts that hold us back from success."</p>
<p>The crowd grew restless and excited around her.</p>
<p>"We gather here today to start the year fresh. To slough off the hardened, cracked shells of our old selves and proceed anew, with fresh bodies and fresh minds. We advance together with a new charge: to liberate ourselves of the baggage we carried here with us today and to take tomorrow by storm."</p>
<p>Mark observed everyone around him exchanging excited looks and tapping their feet impatiently.</p>
<p>Brooke continued, "We wash away the poor grades, the lost matches, the slept-through exams."</p>
<p>The crowd erupted into a loud, "We wash them away!" which they roared in unison.</p>
<p>Brooke grinned and continued. "We wash away the arguments, the grudges, the soured relationships."</p>
<p>Again the crowd droned, "We wash them away!"</p>
<p>"We wash away the threat of failure, of defeat, of loss, and of all other obstacles that stand in our way of making this..." Brooke lowered the paper and paraphrased the final words with a gleeful shout, "... the best fucking year we've ever had!"</p>
<p>Mark laughed as everyone cheered. Empty cups flew into the air. Chants and whistles commenced. After a few moments, Brooke quieted everyone down.</p>
<p>"Now everyone go grab a bucket and soap, and then find a place in the yard for you and your partner," she said. "Have a great Washing everyone!"</p>
<p>Natalie turned to Mark, saying, "I'll be right back!" He watched her race off toward the house with several others. They each selected a bucket and grabbed a bar of soap and hurried back to greet their partners. Everyone wandered off around the yard to find a nice spot by a tree or in the warmest patch of sun, while still remaining a few yards from one another.</p>
<p>Natalie came racing back with a look of wild excitement. She placed the supplies between them and then stood back up to face her partner, taking a deep breath. "Okay! Wakey-wakey -- time to get nakey!" she exclaimed cheerfully.</p>
<p>Mark smiled nervously at her, as it registered that the moment of truth had arrived. Natalie paused momentarily, searching his eyes for signs of what he might be feeling, then developed a huge grin. She grasped the bottom of her t-shirt, looked him straight in the eye, and then launched it upward. As it briefly snagged on her head, Mark found himself suddenly staring at her bare chest. Natalie's small breasts jiggled erratically as she struggled to get the t-shirt over her head. They stretched ever so slightly as she raised her arms up over her head. Then, as her head popped through the opening and she threw down her t-shirt, they were sent swaying briefly from side to side before stopping and pointing outward toward him.</p>
<p>Mark's mind was racing. Here was a close friend, someone he'd taken classes with, gone to concerts with, drank, smoked pot, and played video games with. He felt he had come to know her so well through their friendship, yet somehow here was something totally new, her naked breasts appearing like some new dimension to her persona.</p>
<p>Natalie appeared to be more than amused by Mark's silent bewilderment as he stood there taking it all in. Her wicked grin flittered at the edges of her mouth as she quickly undid the button of her denim shorts. The moment she stuck her thumbs in to push them down Mark realized she hadn't bothered to wear any panties. His heart briefly stopped as she tugged them down and kicked them off. His cock swelled instantly in his pants, necessitating a few moments of pause to bring it back under control.</p>
<p>After a brief glance at the grass to collect himself, he returned his attention to Natalie's crotch. Mark gazed incredulously at his close friend's pussy; two perfectly rounded lips, completely hairless, tucked neatly into the apex between her thighs. She allowed him to quietly observe her, the same look of amusement still frozen on her face as if perpetually on the verge of laughter. He found that he couldn't look away from those smooth folds pursed together with a clean channel running straight down between them.</p>
<p>Finally, Natalie lost control and a peal of laughter broke free. Mark snapped out of it and felt himself turning red.</p>
<p>"Come on, come on... Let's see that hot bod..." she joked, tugging at his shirt.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay," he laughed, blocking her attempts to get it off him.</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes and gestured at him to remove it. Then she squatted down beside the bucket and began to squeeze the sponge as if assessing the temperature of the water.</p>
<p>Mark directed his attention across the yard. Brooke stood nearby with her back to him. With an air of slight insecurity, which he was afraid he may have caused, she shot her shorts down to her feet and stepped out, revealing the bottom half of her green bikini. She quickly reached around her back, targeting the strap of her top. He saw it come loose. Although he couldn't see her chest, Mark could almost sense the free release of her weighty breasts, as if hallucinating their soft dip upon greeting the warm sunlight. He suffered a deep yearning for her to turn... and when she finally did it was nothing short of a fantasy making itself real.</p>
<p>Mark gazed at the perfect outward bearing of her lovely breasts, softly sculpted into two generous orbs. They moved with a tight liquid motion, lagging behind the subtle twists of her body before settling back into place with a gentle wobble. At the tips she possessed two salmon-colored nipples which stood freshly at attention, already sensitive to the glances of bystanders and enjoying the graceful touch of a passing breeze.</p>
<p>Brooke glanced up at Mark, her eyes flashing for an instant in a moment of recognition, keenly observing his curiosity before turning back away and resuming her task.</p>
<p>Her bikini bottoms slid down before he had any time to prepare. The thin strip of material glided swiftly over the smoothly rounded cheeks of her buttocks which wobbled momentarily before steadying themselves and placing on display the faintly perceptible tan line that framed them. She cast him another subtle glance over her shoulder as if occasionally checking to see if he had begun to undress also. Mark became acutely aware of having stalled, becoming transfixed instead with her own progress.</p>
<p>There stood Brooke, nude as the day she was born. Tall, well-proportioned, well-endowed, and suffused with a deeply feminine sex appeal. Mark knew that in mere moments she would inevitably reveal herself to him and every inch of her body would cease to be a mystery. Her most secret, intimate charms remained just one half turn from his desperate eyes, longing to explore every nook and cranny from afar. He ached for that sudden moment of erotic satisfaction as she would share with him a glimpse of the shocking sweetness he imagined of her sex.</p>
<p>Turn she did, and Mark caught sight of a smooth layer of dark brown hair laying flat against her pubic mound. Breathless, he observed a thin gash of bright coral pink which bisected it; the lovely, delicate flesh of her labia standing in stark contrast to the scant swath of dusky hair. This cruel vision of her raw femininity only made him hopeful for more: to experience it with all his other senses. To touch it, to smell her, to taste her body. Privately, intimately, in the throes of a shared passion while they made love, intoxicated on each other's unrelenting arousal.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>Brooke turned her attention back to John, who had just finished undressing.</p>
<p>"Let's go, buddy! Haven't you ever whipped out your cock in public before?" Natalie exclaimed sarcastically, ending with a snort.</p>
<p>Mark kicked off his sandals and quickly yanked his shirt off, feeling the warmth of the sun immediately gracing his chest. Mildly lightheaded, he began to unzip his shorts, feeling as if he was about to step off a cliff. Natalie made it no easier, as she took a step back and placed her hands on her hips, nodding with approval as she examined the unveiling of his body. He tugged his shorts off, standing there in only his boxers. Natalie looked down with a look of breathless anticipation. He followed her eyes to the slight bulge at the front of his boxers, indicating the presence of growing arousal that defied his efforts to block it.</p>
<p>Mark took a deep breath in and then grabbed the waistband of his boxers. Slowly, he bent forward and slid them down his legs, removing them completely at the bottom and placing them on top of his pile of clothes. He stood back up, feeling the sunlight and breeze invading unfamiliar territory. When he was facing Natalie again, he stood there sheepishly, calmly allowing her to examine his exposed penis, which she did with absolute enthusiasm and zeal. She appeared to be concentrating first on his long shaft which, while still flaccid, was beginning to lengthen and thicken more and more under her watchful gaze. Natalie followed it right to the tip, taking delight in the bulbous head of his cock, then followed back up his shaft to his neatly trimmed pubic hair, and down to the tight, swollen pouch of his testicles. As she did this, his eyes traveled back to the clean slit at the entrance to her vagina. For a few moments he felt awkward, yet incredibly aroused, standing before his partner as they quietly explored each other's private parts with great fascination.</p>
<p>Natalie's attention was suddenly drawn elsewhere. Mark raised his eyes and detected a look of surprise on her face, which softened into a curious satisfaction. He studied her expression for a few moments, wondering what was going on, then followed her line of vision. There he found Brooke frozen in a half-step toward her bucket of water. Unaware of either Natalie or Mark's gaze, her attention remained firmly fixed upon the lower half of Mark's body. Her lips pressed together and then moved apart. A mild sense of astonishment lingered on her face as her eyes decidedly devoured the sight of Mark's cock.</p>
<p>She looked up suddenly, catching both of their stares, then frantically turned away, grasping at her bucket and carrying it back to John with her back to them. Mark kept watching. Brooke took another secret glance to the side, then back down at her bucket as she placed it at her feet. She fought heroically to remove a smile from her face that rapidly began to creep across it.</p>
<p>"Aww... look at you two checking each other out..." Mark heard Natalie saying.</p>
<p>Mark chuckled and turned his attention back to Natalie. "Sorry..." he said.</p>
<p>"No, that's okay. I mean... I know I have smaller boobs and all but..." she remarked, with a little self-deprecating humor.</p>
<p>"Oh! No, they're not that small," said Mark, suddenly more attentive to her perky breasts. "Besides, you give guys too much credit. All boobs are good boobs, to us." They both laughed as he gave them an enthusiastic thumbs up.</p>
<p>"Well, get moving then. These little boobies aren't gonna wash themselves!" she joked, scooping them playfully with her hands and pointing them squarely in his direction.</p>
<p>Mark raised an eyebrow. "You mean... I can wash those too?"</p>
<p>"Uhh... duh," replied Natalie, taken aback.</p>
<p>"Wow, okay. I thought I was supposed to avoid certain areas or something."</p>
<p>"What the fuck, dude?" she snorted, "Are you serious? Take a fucking risk once in a while!"</p>
<p>Mark continued chuckling nervously. "I mean... shit. Okay! Do I just... rub them down?"</p>
<p>"Well first you gotta get me wet," Natalie said, before suddenly realizing what she'd said. They both burst into wild laughter. She began to turn a bright red. "Wait... wait... that didn't come out right. Well, maybe it did. Anyway, I mean you gotta grab the sponge and get the soap and water all over me first. Then you can have at it."</p>
<p>"All right," Mark said, clapping his hands and rubbing them together as if excited to get started.</p>
<p>He bent down and fished the large, water-logged sponge out of their bucket, then stood face to face with his partner. Natalie's body tensed up with excitement as he held the object beside her neck and gave it a soft squeeze. A gush of water was released and crashed into her shoulder. A quick river of water ran over her skin, shining like quicksilver in the afternoon sun. It branched in two; one ribbon snaking into the shadowy pocket of her armpit and the other zipping down her chest and winding its way through the small division between her breasts.</p>
<p>Mark resaturated the sponge in order to repeat the process and, on his way back up, discovered that Natalie's body was quickly becoming covered in small goosebumps that stood out prominently from her flesh. He doused the other side of her body with water and watched her hair stand on end. Her small pink nipples pointed happily outward, unmistakably sensitive to the water, the air, and his close presence.</p>
<p>He continued the process of squeezing water over her body, then began to rub the sponge gently over her body. As it ran along the side of her torso, it tugged gently at the side of her breast, causing it to spring to life as the friction was released. Feeling a surge of arousal at the sight of her jostling chest he quickly cast his eyes downward to her bellybutton, fixating on the dark hollow while he attempted to steady his mind.</p>
<p>Mark gave the sponge another squeeze upon her stomach and watched the water run downward and pool into her navel. It briefly collected there then emptied itself, causing a fine stream of water to run downward into her pubic area. The small trickle of water found its way to her labia, running smoothly through her intimate cleft, and Mark discovered how swollen it had become. Her two smooth lips seemed to expand with clear arousal. It was only then, beaded with tiny droplets of moisture, that he noticed the scant, almost imperceptible hairs growing back with a light stubble.</p>
<p>He squatted down to run the sponge over her thighs, growing dizzy with his own arousal over the intimate view he was receiving of her private parts; being able to so closely study the details of her captivating womanhood. He felt his thickening cock gently slapping against his thighs as he began to run the sponge more quickly over her lower body, while trying to exorcise the tempting thoughts that started to invade his mind. With each heavy slap, he grew ever more conscious that the battle he was waging with himself was destined to end in failure.</p>
<p>Just as his fear of an embarrassing erection reached its peak, its growth was halted unexpectedly by a troubling distraction nearby. Mark had just glanced to his right for a quick check on Brooke. There he found John carrying on in front of his friends as he stood by her with their sponge in one hand. She turned her back to him for a moment. All of a sudden, John swung his hand flat against Brooke's buttocks.</p>
<p>A deafening smack echoed across the yard.</p>
<p>Mark watched as Brooke winced. Her butt cheeks gave a violent wobble. Within moments a red mark began to form on the site of impact. She turned and gave a slightly embarrassed smile at their friends, however, Mark caught a private glare shared briefly between her and her boyfriend seconds later. Suddenly Brooke glanced over at Mark, realizing that he'd seen what happened. His heart sank as he saw her expression; a mixture of embarrassment and pain.</p>
<p>John briefly stopped laughing to announce, "Can you believe I have the hottest fucking girlfriend ever?!" One of his frat brothers started to laugh and nod. Mark stared incredulously at the one giving this response, who responded with agreement while his own girlfriend stood just behind him.</p>
<p>"Hey--" Mark heard Natalie say.</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry," he replied, realizing he'd been neglecting his partner.</p>
<p>"No problem. I don't blame you."</p>
<p>"For what?"</p>
<p>"For hoping that Brooke feeds the hose right up John's ass, cranks the knob, and storms off."</p>
<p>Mark laughed. "You know, a freak colonoscopy is surprisingly close to what I was thinking..." Natalie snickered.</p>
<p>"Okay, now that you've got me all sopping wet and dripping," Natalie continued with a sly grin, "why don't you grab that bar of soap and see how slippery you can make me."</p>
<p>Mark glanced up and down Natalie's body, still doing his best to be respectful about it despite her teasing. Her supple, naked flesh was beaded with glistening droplets of water that sparkled in the sunlight. Occasionally, a small drop freed itself and made a run for it down her chest, snaking between her budding breasts and inevitably curling around the opening of her bellybutton before vanishing inside.</p>
<p>He reached for the bar of soap that had been supplied to them. It was off-white and veined with bluish striations. A distinct imprint of a seashell was stamped into it at the center of one side which bowed slightly outward. As soon as it became the slightest bit damp it instantly lathered into a smooth, creamy texture, so much so that it almost squirted out of his grip.</p>
<p>Mark wet his hands a second time and rubbed the bar of soap vigorously in his hands. All at once a powerfully refreshing scent filled his nostrils. Memories flooded his mind: childhood vacations on Cape Cod, the vanishing shoreline of an endless beach, slowly cruising fishing boats, the erratic squirt of clams tickling his bare feet. He lifted the soap to his nose and inhaled. Greening jetties, laughter, seagulls, the wind in his hair. It was an invigorating scent; the kind you see in television commercials with a montage of people showering with over-the-top enthusiasm.</p>
<p>He immediately saw this joy written across Natalie's face as he began to lather her body and engulf her in this scent. He could just see her there, in the shower, singing into her fist like it was a microphone and extolling the joys of her revitalizing cleanser.</p>
<p>"Holy shit, this stuff smells good," he finally remarked, sliding his hands up and down the length of her arms which she eagerly thrust forward for him.</p>
<p>"I know!" Natalie laughed, "Azure Bay is the best!"</p>
<p>Mark grinned. "Is that the hip soap these days?" he joked. "Are we using the 'in' soap?"</p>
<p>Natalie laughed. "Yeah, this soap is trending. All the cool kids are using it. If they made a dry, powdered version I'm sure we'd all be snorting it after class and hearing about it on the evening news."</p>
<p>"It's the latest craze!" Mark chuckled. He held it up to his nose and sniffed it again. "I wonder if anyone's tried freebasing this stuff."</p>
<p>They both found themselves in a fit of hysterics, laughing joyfully as they became enveloped in the fresh scent of the soap now beginning to form a thick layer of slippery suds over the bare flesh of Natalie's body. Mark continued to slather her from head to toe, coating her arms, her stomach, as well as her legs, and even her feet. However, he carefully avoided making any contact with her chest or reaching between her legs for that matter, an area he felt for sure she'd not welcome his greedy fingers. Mark proceeded anxiously, anticipating saving her breasts for last.</p>
<p>The moment he otherwise completed her front, Natalie squealed with delight and hopped in place, rotating her body one-hundred and eighty degrees. Knowing Mark was still squatting down by her feet, she stuck her bum in his face. He found himself staring at her two cheeks, covered in a glistening sheen and wobbling freely in response to Natalie's spirited giggling. Natalie reached back, raised her hand, and then quickly smacked one cheek, sending it jiggling even more.</p>
<p>"How's that for a butt-smack?" she asked. Mark smirked. "Wanna try? I could teach John a thing or two. There's a fine line. It's gotta be firm, yes, but not outright cruel. Go ahead, I can take it!"</p>
<p>"I dunno..." Mark said. Natalie snickered and wagged her buttocks closer to his face. He drew back, laughing. "My nose almost went in your crack!"</p>
<p>"It's okay, it's clean!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Oh man..." he chuckled.</p>
<p>"Come ooonnn," she whined.</p>
<p>Mark leaned back and swung his hand forward to give Natalie's butt a gentle smack. He felt his flat palm make contact with the soft, spongy flesh which rippled instantly under the pressure.</p>
<p>"Ngh! Yes! -- Again!" Natalie arched her back and extended her rear end further outward, in Mark's direction. Suddenly he could distinctly see her pussy sandwiched between her legs. Her labia began to part, allowing a slow-moving gob of soap suds to weave its way over her pink, satiny flesh.</p>
<p>With a smirk, Mark smacked her butt cheek again, firmly, yet still clear of the pain John had caused Brooke.</p>
<p>"Oooh, fuck! Yes..." Natalie groaned. Mark rolled his eyes and chuckled again before rubbing his hands in brisk circles over her cheeks, coating them in a comical white layer of foam.</p>
<p>"There! Done!" he said, standing back up while patting her bum happily.</p>
<p>Natalie turned and looked at him eagerly. He faced her squarely and looked down at her chest. Her breasts were unavoidable now, being the last bits on the agenda. Natalie eyed him curiously and with no shortage of amusement. Her perky boobs stuck outward from her chest like two small apples waiting to be plucked from a tree. He inhaled sharply and then reached forward, placing his hands upon them and feeling her hardened nipples poking into the palms of his hands.</p>
<p>Natalie snickered. "Goin' in for the kill..."</p>
<p>Mark laughed and relaxed a little at the humorous nature of the situation, then began to softly knead her boobs with his hands. His fingers curled around them, cupped them from underneath, and slid smoothly over her nipples. Moving in circles, he covered her soft, pliable flesh in a carpet of foam. Mark glanced up at Natalie, expecting her to be looking down at her breasts as he fondled them, but he was surprised to see her eyes closed. She was breathing softly in and out, lost in the sensation as if in a dream.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of eye contact, Mark felt his anxiety subside for a moment. He, too, succumbed to the overwhelming pleasure of the experience; the joy of standing there nude, caressing a beautiful young woman's bare breasts, soapy, wet, soft, and slippery under the constant movement of his curious hands. He softly squeezed then compressed them together, observing their movement, their springy texture, and the stark contrast with her now extremely erect nipples. If he applied too much pressure, they would squirt free from his grasp and wiggle into place. After several moments, he grew worried that she might laugh at his eagerness and he stopped.</p>
<p>"Okay, how's that?" Mark asked, taking a step back and observing her fully lathered body. Slowly moving strips of white slid lazily down her arms, chest, and legs. A small mass of suds spread over her breasts and began to curl down the sides, allowing her pink nipples to emerge once again and point excitedly in his direction. He struggled to maintain his arousal as some of the soap was funneled toward the apex of her sex where it slid smoothly over her bare mound and traveled through the fissure of her swollen lips.</p>
<p>"You missed a spot..." she said coyly, opening her eyes slowly.</p>
<p>"I did?"</p>
<p>Natalie grabbed Mark's hand. He flinched as she slid it down over her pubic mound. Mark's heart started racing as he felt his fingers slip between the smooth lips of her pussy then sink into a warm, wet hollow, even more slippery than her outer flesh. Slippery in the way a woman's own body lubricated itself, and more viscous than any soap.</p>
<p>"W-whoa..." he said, startled. "You want me to wash there too?"</p>
<p>"Mmm hmm..." she moaned, her constant joking suddenly silenced by the sensation of Mark's fingers sliding over her sensitive clit.</p>
<p>Mark began slowly rubbing his fingers back and forth over the hardening nub now peeking outward, and then dragged them through the parting seam of her outer labia, increasingly swollen and alive with an electric tingling. He listened to her soft sighs, watching her adjust her stance to widen farther for him. She let her head droop forward as if weakened by the incredible pleasure of his careful stimulation.</p>
<p>Mark could feel Natalie starting to squirm. Her eyes were closed again. She was droning softly to herself. He gazed downward, watching her moist flesh parting for his fingers and then sealing back up again as he dragged his fingers over her vulva. She suddenly whimpered as he grew bolder, sinking his digits deep inside her body and then slowly dragging them back out again, listening to the faint crackle of sticky wetness releasing itself from his fingers.</p>
<p>She began to gyrate her hips slightly, urging him to continue, begging him with her body to continue stroking her pussy. Wild, erotic sensations moved in waves up and down his body, surges of adrenaline that unsteadied his mind, that made him yearn for her to respond in kind and touch his own body.</p>
<p>"Fuck... this is it..." he heard himself think as the blood rushed between his legs. There was no stopping it now. He felt his cock first begin to thicken and expand between his thighs, then start to twitch and harden. It slowly rose away from his body, throb by throb, until it ticked up into the air and extended fully away from his body. His hard cock now reached triumphantly toward the sky, boldly announcing the sheer thrill of the experience at hand, as Natalie's warm, slippery body quivered in his hands.</p>
<p>Mark's thoughts became wild and frantic. Would everyone laugh at the fact that he sported a skyward boner? Would Brooke be upset that it was caused by Natalie? His partner still had her eyes closed and was swooning at his every touch. He wondered what her reaction would be the moment she opened her eyes, looked down, and saw his massive erection.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with embarrassment, Mark glanced out across the lawn. To his surprise, he soon found himself confronted with a plethora of erect penises. In the time that had elapsed while he worked on Natalie's body, every guy in the yard had succumbed to their arousal just as he did. Suddenly, he was no longer so alone. He stood there gawking at the sight of stiff, bobbing erections on all sides, then glanced down at his own, gently swinging from side to side as he continued to move his hands over Natalie's body.</p>
<p>Then, just like that, he looked back up and saw Brooke. Her eyes were lifted slightly, narrowed, gazing intently. For a moment they moved to his eyes, then lowered again. His head felt hot. She was obvious about what she was doing. His lengthy, swollen member was the object of her full attention. A small smile began to form on her lips. He smiled back, waiting for her eyes to meet his again.</p>
<p>She shot him another look, blinked a few times, then exploded into a huge grin. Embarrassed by her own reaction, she looked away, hiding her enjoyment from him. Mark began to laugh. His heart beat frantically.</p>
<p>Natalie opened her eyes. "What?" she said. "Did--" She looked downward suddenly, her eyes having caught the movement of his wavering manhood. Natalie's eyes grew twice their size in the span of a couple seconds. Mark sheepishly withdrew his hand from her sopping pussy.</p>
<p>"My, my, my... Would you look at that..." she remarked excitedly. Natalie's eyes sparkled as she gazed directly at it. He flinched briefly as she reached out and grasped him firmly. Natalie gave his member a quick tug as if to get a sense of its hardness and length. She cocked her head at it thoughtfully. "Actually, it's as big as my favorite dildo. Almost."</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Mark looked down at her, shaking his head and smirking. She glanced up at him with a devilish grin. Still dripping with suds, Natalie bent over and grabbed the water-logged sponge from the bucket, then stood back up with an expression of mirthful enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Your turn!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Mark stood directly before Natalie, stiff and straight as a rod, while she began to hold the sponge over one shoulder and then the next, squeezing out the water and letting it run down over his body. She then started to run it smoothly over his chest, up and down his arms, then over his stomach. He watched the silly grin splashed relentlessly across her face as she made her way down toward his groin. Natalie nonchalantly ran the sponge over his thighs and then circled inward where she ran it gently over his cock in both directions, causing it to briefly flop about. Mark enjoyed the cool sensation of the cool air over his damp erection.</p>
<p>As she continued down his legs and toward his feet, Mark became fascinated with the way she'd grown silent, becoming deeply focused on every detail of his body and grinning wildly the whole time. Now and then her eyes darted upward, distracted by the sight of his swinging shaft which responded to the force of the sponge against his skin. He found her whimsical expression arousing, analyzing her quiet contemplation of his bobbing testicles, the whipping motion of his massive girth, his rosy cockhead. Her secret attention made him flustered. His pleasure grew. He felt his body pulsing.</p>
<p>Glancing out across the yard Mark caught sight of various men and women standing about having their bodies sponged down or lathered up. He was surprised to see that none of the guys seemed to care in the least about their massive erections being on display in front of the group. The girls attending to them were in various states of amusement or bashfulness, as the guys allowed the full extension of their manhood to reach outward toward their partner's face, springing about stiffly as the brisk movement of a sponge or pair of hands worked their bodies.</p>
<p>Natalie sprang to her feet as if she had a sudden idea. Already giggling, she turned around and bent slightly forward, playfully wagging her bum toward Mark's cock until it slapped against her cheeks and sent them briefly quivering. Feeling for his member, she extended her rear-end further until his cock was sandwiched into her slick, soapy crack. She began to grind against him with a slow twerk, allowing him to glide smoothly between the mounds of moist, slippery flesh.</p>
<p>"Oh my god," he groaned.</p>
<p>"You like that?" she laughs, whipping her head around to catch his expression.</p>
<p>She continued to move her ass against him with a scooping motion, trying to use the suction between her glistening, rounded cheeks to playfully jerk him off. Hearing him begin to moan she squealed and hopped in place, spinning around to face him again. She grabbed the soap and lathered up her hands, then began to rub them over his shoulders and chest. Down she went, her mouth slightly ajar, her eyes wide and attentive, watching his naked body slowly developing a soapy sheen.</p>
<p>Natalie zipped across Mark's body with her silky hands as if rushing through a lead-up to the main event. Having saved his pubic area for last, she finally squatted down in front of his pelvis until her butt just barely touched the grass and her perky breasts wobbled excitedly before his massive cock. She reached forward and eagerly grasped it with her soapy hands. Mark felt a sudden swell of pleasure. She began tugging at him with long, slick strokes which began to coat his penis with a thick white film. She massaged it happily and with great enthusiasm, as if she had a new toy.</p>
<p>After a few moments of focused determination in cultivating his raw, urgent pleasure, Natalie's eyes flashed upward toward Mark's spellbound gaze. She appeared to be turning some thought over and over in her head as if polishing a jewel.</p>
<p>"You didn't see what she did..." she quietly mumbled. A strange sense of deep satisfaction began to reveal itself through her expression.</p>
<p>"Huh?" said Mark.</p>
<p>"When she first saw you naked. Before you looked over at her..."</p>
<p>"Brooke?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Natalie replied, returning her attention to his soapy cock as it burrowed through the tight canal of her fist.</p>
<p>"What did she do?" said Mark, suddenly overcome with intrigue. He briefly shifted his attention over to Brooke, who had a faraway look and was deep in the task of rubbing down her boyfriend's body. He realized that Natalie had been observing him, observing Brooke, searching for any signs of their growing attraction and taking great interest in the chemistry that she knew was at play.</p>
<p>"Oh my god... I'm going to savor that look... when she first saw your penis..." Natalie mumbled to herself, barely acknowledging his question. It was as if their delight was all hers. She owned it. She had invited it, after all.</p>
<p>"What look?! What did she do?" Mark begged.</p>
<p>"And yours!" Natalie giggled. "When you saw her, without her clothes!" She briefly slowed her deep strokes to hold her belly with her other hand and calm her laughter.</p>
<p>"Tell me!"</p>
<p>Natalie whistled, then cast Mark a teasing look. "Maybe you ought to ask her about it on your first date..." Mark laughed. "I don't blame her," continued Natalie, resuming her long, hard strokes. "Look at this big cock..."</p>
<p>Mark groaned as the force and pressure of her manipulations caused him an intense, tingling pleasure that he could barely contain.</p>
<p>"Gotta get it niiice and clean," she cooed, studying his manhood with a look of pure admiration. Mark grinned as she eagerly pumped her tight grip back and forth along the full length of his shaft, pointing the thick head of his cock straight at her own face and watching the white rings of froth bloom and melt over it. "A nice biiig, clean penis for Brooke's vagina," she continued to muse with an air of pride.</p>
<p>Mark burst into nervous laughter.</p>
<p>"What?" Natalie said, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself? Er, us?"</p>
<p>Natalie continued pumping Mark's cock smoothly as if trying to amplify the wet sluicing sound. She glanced up at him with a smirk. "You never know. Best to be ready. The moment there's any sign of a chance with her, you gotta make your move."</p>
<p>Mark looked down at her curiously, surprised at her determination to see them hook up.</p>
<p>"Knowing her, if she goes on the market, I guarantee it won't be for long," she cautioned.</p>
<p>Mark turned his attention once again to Brooke, catching her sneaking a look in his direction. They locked eyes. He felt suddenly self-conscious, knowing that she was watching Natalie busily working her magic on his stiff cock. She looked slightly melancholy, but couldn't tell if that was really the case or just wishful thinking on his part. They stood there, somehow unable to look away from one another.</p>
<p>He wondered how long she'd been watching him and Natalie. If she simply seemed quieted due to her boyfriend's antics. If she'd been embarrassed in front of him. He hoped that she was starting to realize that John wasn't right for her. He wanted her to entertain the notion of spending more time with him. As much as Mark didn't want to admit it, he couldn't help but feel a fierce satisfaction about John's inadequacy in that moment. It was accompanied by a surge of optimism and a yearning for Brooke, as well as a wild desire for her newly unveiled body.</p>
<p>Suddenly overwhelmed with erotic excitement, Mark cast a sudden look down at Natalie, still vigorously working his thickly-lathered cock into a wild, surging projection about to reach the breaking point.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay!" he laughed, beginning to pull away. "Any more and I might... err... end up having to wash you all over again."</p>
<p>Natalie let go of his cock and howled with laughter. "Not that I'd mind, but yeah, you'd better save it for Brooke." She stood up with an air of satisfaction.</p>
<p>"You're quite the matchmaker, aren't you?" he commented. Natalie whistled innocently. "That's it, isn't it? You're one of those matchmaker types."</p>
<p>"What can I say? Brooke's a good friend of mine, and I'd much rather she be with a hot stud like yourself than that big fucking asshole."</p>
<p>"And here I was thinking you're coming onto me..." he joked.</p>
<p>"Oh! Well, I am. You know-- secondary motives and all," said Natalie with a wicked grin. "Truthfully, I ALSO asked you here so I could jerk off your man-meat. Just consider it my payment for when you finally get to fuck Brooke." They both burst into laughter again.</p>
<p>"No one ever accused me of not being honest!" she said, shrugging.</p>
<p>"I guess not!" replied Mark. She gave him a wink.</p>
<p>The Washing continued for a while until everyone was suitably clean and satisfied with the show they'd each put on for one another. Soon, buckets were jokingly upturned over heads, hoses came out and roared across squealing, naked bodies. There were shrieks and laughter until the merriment began to subside and the summer sun began to warm and dry their skin. As the clothes came back on, Mark clung to the last moments he had to observe Brooke au natural, as she did in return.</p>
<p>For all the fun they had had, he couldn't help but be left in a melancholy state, wondering what if she hadn't been tied up with John...</p>
<p>Mark's bloodshot eyes shot open as his phone started to go off. So early in the morning, the ringtone sounded achingly shrill, not to mention the jarring buzz of the device's vibration on the table next to his head.</p>
<p>"What the fuck, dude?" groaned Trevon, wrapping his pillow over his ears.</p>
<p>Mark blindly reached for his phone but he missed the call. It was from Natalie.</p>
<p>"Huh?" he mumbled to himself as he muted the phone. For a moment, in his half-asleep state, he thought maybe he'd made a mistake in being Natalie's partner; that now she was calling him in the wee hours of the morning, positively obsessed, maybe even stalking him. However, the phone lit up in his hand again, this time with a text message. It soon clarified everything.</p>
<p>"Red alert," it said, followed by a series of stop sign emojis. "Earth to Mark! Quit jerking off in your sleep and wake up," said the next one. Then another: "Brooke and John had a massive fight last night... It's over! She's no longer just your wet dream. She's actually on my couch right now." Mark gazed at her messages through the blurry vision of interrupted sleep, only just beginning to process what they said.</p>
<p>"Time to make your move! I think I convinced her that you two should get hitched. LOL!" Mark laughed. "OMG -- Mark and Brooke babies..." said another, this time with a smiling face and heart eyes. Mark rolled over on his side, buried himself in the sheets, and smirked into the pocket of darkness. Each time his phone screen lit up, the good news shone brilliantly across his face.</p>
<p>"Where are you? Bring a boombox! You can stand outside the window and serenade her!" Natalie was saying, still texting him over and over. "FYI she's into the really sappy shit."</p>
<p>"Shhhh," Mark finally replied. "I'm almost done jerking off! Thanks to your news, it just got so much better." He snickered.</p>
<p>Three dots appeared on his screen, indicating that Natalie was typing something. They stopped and went away. Then they returned.</p>
<p>"Good boy. Hurry up though," she said, before finally falling silent.</p>
<p>Mark rolled onto his back and stared up at the ceiling. He finally had his chance with Brooke and it seemed she might just be equally into him. After a few moments of wrapping his head around the opportunity that the day presented, Mark pulled himself out of bed and took a shower. By the time he got out, another message was waiting for him.</p>
<p>Natalie had written: "Heads up! Brooke's going to grab" -- followed by a hot coffee emoji.</p>
<p>Mark scrambled to throw his clothes on, grabbed his bag, and ran out the door to head for the campus coffee shop. Sure enough, when he arrived he spotted her at the counter sipping her coffee and gazing out the window, in the same spot they had stood when she invited him to her Washing. Unaware of his presence, Mark stood in line tapping his foot anxiously as it advanced slowly toward the barista.</p>
<p>After placing his order, he briefly waited for his coffee amidst a sizable crowd of irritable students desperate for caffeine. As he observed Brooke from afar, he heard his order called out: "Mark!" Brooke turned suddenly, hearing his name, and their eyes met. Her face lit up. Mark waved and grabbed his coffee, then hurried over to her.</p>
<p>"Hey there!" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Hi Mark!" she replied. The pensive mood he had been observing had all but vanished the moment she laid eyes on him.</p>
<p>Mark suddenly realized he had no idea what to say to her. He wanted to know about the breakup but couldn't raise the topic. Later he would have to approach Natalie to dish out the details. He took a sip of his coffee.</p>
<p>"Ahhh, that's good," he groaned.</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "I know, right? Can't start the day without it." She took a deep sip. "I'm in a weird mood this morning. I added oat milk."</p>
<p>"How is it?"</p>
<p>"Good! It adds a little nuttiness without diluting the taste of the coffee."</p>
<p>"Nice. We all need a little nuttiness in our lives," he chuckled.</p>
<p>"Seriously!" Brooke laughed. "Here, try it," she said, offering him a sip. He accepted her drink and took a swig, then nodded and gave her a big thumbs up as he swallowed. It was a simple gesture, but somehow he felt closer to her just by sharing a sip of coffee.</p>
<p>"Oh, I wanted to thank you for letting me come to your Washing yesterday."</p>
<p>"No problem! Did you have fun?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I really did. I guess it's different for guys, like you said, but you were right-- it was sorta empowering."</p>
<p>Brooke beamed and gave Mark a sudden, warm hug that took him by surprise. "Yay! Were you nervous?" she asked.</p>
<p>"A little bit, at first. But after a while, I just relaxed and had fun."</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "Yeah... I could see that you had fun."</p>
<p>Mark gave her a sheepish smile, embarrassed by her subtle reference to his arousal. "How about you?"</p>
<p>Brooke became suddenly thoughtful. "Yeah... I mean... it's always fun. But I'm sorry about-- well, nevermind. I just realized that what you get out of it sorta depends on who you're with, I guess. Um. I don't think I was with the right person."</p>
<p>Mark was about to say, "Yeah, I heard. Sorry about that," but he caught himself. She broke up with John just the night before. For all he knew, Natalie was the only one who knew so far and he didn't want to reveal the fact that they'd discussed it just moments earlier. "Ah... that's too bad..." he mumbled instead.</p>
<p>"Annnnyway..." Brooke sighed. "Are you excited for the Washing tomorrow?" Brooke asked, suddenly lifting herself back up with a cheerful attitude.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's right. The big one on Friday. It must be huge."</p>
<p>"Yes! It's gigantic. Everyone goes."</p>
<p>"Are you... still going? Given the partner issues..."</p>
<p>"Well... let's just say there are no more partner issues," she said, smiling softly at him. He smiled back. "But I dunno. I mean... of course I want to, but... I'll figure something out." She stared down at the floor for a few moments, then glanced up at Mark curiously, then out the window.</p>
<p>Mark felt a surge of adrenaline swelling inside him. "Do you... um... want to be my partner then? I mean... unless you're planning to ask someone..."</p>
<p>Brooke looked up at him with surprise. "You weren't planning to ask Natalie?" she sputtered. Mark realized that despite whatever Natalie had said in the spirit of matchmaking, Brooke was still concerned that maybe he was interested in Natalie herself.</p>
<p>"Oh, she won't mind. It's not like I'm after her or anything," he quickly clarified. "She just knew I didn't have a partner for your Washing and offered to introduce me to the event so that I'd be able to go."</p>
<p>Brooke's eyes lit up. "Oh! I was wondering why she wouldn't tell me that you and she--" She cut herself off mid-sentence. "Well... Sure! I'd love to be your partner." All of a sudden Brooke was all smiles. Mark observed that she was breathing at a faster rate. He was too.</p>
<p>"Great! I'm still a little bewildered by the whole thing," he admitted. "It'll be good to have you there with me."</p>
<p>"Yeah... it will be," she replied with a grin. "Well, I'd better get moving to class."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>"See you later, partner!"</p>
<p>They exchanged one more smile as Brooke rushed out of the coffee shop. Mark watched her go, as if in a trance. Perhaps it was the sunlight, but she seemed to be glowing.</p>
<p>That night Mark lay in bed unable to sleep. The sensation of exploring Natalie's soapy, naked body with his hands played in his head over and over. He resisted the urge to jerk off, still stuck in a dorm room with Trevon nearby, but his cock strained painfully in his boxers beneath the sheets. Under any other circumstances, this erotic fantasy would have been enough. However, at the core of his growing arousal was a distinct excitement about the prospect of soon repeating the same experience with Brooke.</p>
<p>Everything was about to change between them. No longer would their interactions be limited to secret displays of naked affections across a sunny expanse of grass. They were about to grant each other the keys to their bodies. The floodgates would soon be open. They were about to enter each other's private domain.</p>
<p>Morning broke and Mark was left wondering if he managed to get any sleep at all. The big day had arrived and the event taking place that afternoon couldn't have happened soon enough. An extra large coffee did little to wake Mark from his trance and the absence of Brooke at the coffee shop only left him more anxious for the swift passage of time. His classes passed by as mere distractions until the critical hour approached and he made his way to the center of campus.</p>
<p>Only on a few occasions had Mark seen the quad so teeming with students. It looked like the scene of an outdoor music festival where concert-goers arrived in batches and began to cluster in rings, full of enthusiasm. Over the next thirty minutes, it was as if the entire school had arrived. It was not without organization, however, as several volunteers began meticulously filling buckets and passing them around with sponges and bars of soap from boxes of bulk supplies. Students poured in from every direction to receive their ration, all wearing loose-fitting casual clothing.</p>
<p>Mark observed some students strutting about confidently, however, he was most intrigued by those who appeared to be gripped with fear, biting their nails, standing erect with tension in their bodies, clearly nervous about stripping down to their birthday suits in a matter of minutes. Unlike the smaller Washings, he noticed that there were many large groups of students gathered alongside couples like the ones who attended Brooke and John's. Some of them were mixed gender, while others were not, such as a group of shy girls huddled together, clearly full of anxious tension and shaken nerves. Mark recalled what Brooke had said about what the experience would be for them and he felt excited that he would soon bear witness to their experience of supportive, naked empowerment.</p>
<p>Making his way to a small oak tree that Brooke had suggested they meet at, Mark continued to watch the last of his peers turn up. He studied each and every one that passed, wondering if he'd soon see them naked or not. The butterflies began to form as an occasional girl he found himself most curious about decided to settle into a spot nearby, finding it just as good as any other, and establish herself amongst the individuals he would soon be able to observe without any clothing on.</p>
<p>As they leaned down to drop their bags onto the grass, he caught sight of their loosely swinging breasts jostling about within their thin cotton tops and enjoyed the way their dark nipples peeked through the sunlit fabric each time they brushed against the surface. Many of them decided to wear pajama bottoms as they would be easy to slip on and off. Their soft buttocks wiggled about beneath the fuzzy fabric, some of them clearly unrestricted by the panties that had been decidedly left behind. He imagined them bashfully pulling them down, revealing their private parts, pitting the thrill of their determination against an ever-present terror of exposure.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>In the midst of his bewilderment from being confronted by these temptations, Mark spotted the most beautiful woman yet, weaving through the amassing crowd with a sly grin and a long, confident stride. In his hyper-receptive state, he suffered a sudden pang of desire at the moment their eyes met. He was so engrossed in the vision of her sudden appearance that it took him a strangely long time to even become aware that he was, in fact, watching Brooke herself making her way through the crowd and approaching the very spot they'd planned to meet.</p>
<p>Brooke had hastily slipped on a pair of yoga shorts which did little to cover her lower body. Her long, bare legs terminated at her familiar brown running shoes that moved swiftly over the grass. Brooke's smooth butt, tightly contained by the spandex, bubbled outward behind her. The crotch of her shorts cinched into a small vertex, with a seam running down the middle in a mildly suggestive manner. She wore a tight-fitting, gray v-neck t-shirt which exaggerated the swelling of her braless chest that heaved gently from side to side and displayed a pair of pert nipples which poked visibly out through the fabric. The passing breeze blew locks of her hair across her face which she blew back away as if huffing and puffing at her late arrival.</p>
<p>"I'm here! I'm here!" she laughed as she rushed to Mark's side and briefly gripped his hand. She stood beside him, catching her breath and beaming.</p>
<p>"Having second thoughts?" he joked.</p>
<p>"Hell no!" she exclaimed, bending forward and holding her stomach. "Sorry, I'm a little out of breath. I got held up at my last class."</p>
<p>"So what you're saying is that you're all sweaty..."</p>
<p>"Yeah... a little bit..." she snickered.</p>
<p>"Well that's convenient, I was about to offer the fair maiden a luxurious bath!"</p>
<p>Brooke grinned. "Oh! How thoughtful of you!" she replied. "I shall oblige on the condition that I may bathe thee, as well."</p>
<p>"Surely!"</p>
<p>Brooke threw her arms around his neck and Mark pulled her close. He could feel her heart beating and his beating back against it.</p>
<p>"This is exciting!" she confessed, gazing into his eyes.</p>
<p>"Yeah!" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Brooke raised an eyebrow. "Are you still nervous?" she asked, her lips curling into a grin.</p>
<p>"Horribly so."</p>
<p>Brooke threw her head back and laughed along with him. When the laughter subsided, she gave him a soft smile and said, "Well, I promise... when I'm done with you, you'll be very, very relaxed..." They exchanged grins.</p>
<p>Brooke glanced around the area, taking note of who was around, just as Mark had done. She observed the buckets everywhere, filled to the brim with water, as well as the multitude of cheap sponges and bars of soap gripped by revelers gathered all around them.</p>
<p>"Just a moment!" she exclaimed, raising her finger in the air before rushing off.</p>
<p>Moments later, Mark watched Brooke returning with their own bucket and supplies, weaving back through the crowds of couples and large groups of friends, gathered in circles and breaking into disjointed laughter. They were no doubt laughing at the jokes, confessions, and other sorts of comments inspired by the fact that they were on the verge of removing their clothes together. Soon to be frolicking naked on the grass, exposing every inch of their bodies to each other's curious eyes while risking arousal and stoking the fire of secret crushes.</p>
<p>The electricity of the crowd had reached its zenith. The girls looked at their assembling guy-friends as if holding secret bets with each other about the variety of penises they were about to make a mental inventory of. The guys practically danced on their toes, surrounded by the girls they'd become friends with, no doubt having fantasized about, brimming with excitement about the moment boobs would start popping out everywhere and the thrill of seeing pairs of panties sliding down their long legs.</p>
<p>The nervous excitement was finally interrupted by the whine and crackle of a microphone. "Okay everyone!" a booming voice suddenly shouted. The energized voices around them suddenly quieted down and grew attentive. "Hi! Welcome!" the voice continued. "Is everyone ready for this year's annual Washing?!"</p>
<p>The crowd roared, providing an instant indication to just how large it had grown. The unseen man with the microphone continued his welcome speech as Brooke and Mark took occasional side glances at one another, gritting their teeth excitedly and tapping their feet impatiently. Mark found himself swimming with emotions. Soon Mark heard the rattle of a piece of paper through the loudspeaker. After a pause, the affirmations began, which he realized were standard and well-codified; read in exactly the same manner year after year.</p>
<p>"We gather here today to expunge ourselves of the mistakes of our pasts, to rinse our minds of the things that trouble us and to wash away the memories of past failures. As we cleanse our bodies, so too are we cleansing our minds, our emotions, the negative thoughts that hold us back from success."</p>
<p>The crowd grew as restless and excited around Brooke and Mark as their friends had been at the earlier Washing. Students everywhere watched, listened, and exchanged looks. The man made his way swiftly through the speech as the energy and tension on the quad grew at a constant rate.</p>
<p>"We wash away the poor grades, the lost matches, the slept-through exams."</p>
<p>"We wash them away!" everyone roared in unison, Mark included, having now become familiar with the rites.</p>
<p>"We wash away the arguments, the grudges, the soured relationships."</p>
<p>Again the crowd droned, "We wash them away!"</p>
<p>"We wash away the threat of failure, of defeat, of loss, and of all other obstacles that stand in our way of making this the best year of our lives! Have a happy Washing everyone!" the man shouted at the top of his lungs, before switching off the microphone.</p>
<p>The crowd erupted into a storm of activity, at the center of which stood Brooke and Mark, turning to face one another. Beyond Brooke, a sea of clothed bodies grew increasingly animated. Patterns of colored fabric sailed upward and down again until they littered the grass and gave way to a network of skin tones that began to flood the quad.</p>
<p>Brooke gave Mark a huge grin before grabbing hold of her t-shirt and yanking it upward, over her head. Her large breasts pressed firmly against the fabric as it slid upward until it cleared her chest. Her two large boobs sprang free and bobbed happily before her with an impish buoyancy. Then she yanked her yoga shorts down and tossed them aside, before standing back up in all her naked glory. Mark's chest swelled with excitement at the now-familiar sight of her gorgeous figure. His eyes traveled down her body to the soft patch of fuzz between her legs and the delicate pink lips peeking through to arrest his attention.</p>
<p>Brooke cheered as Mark hurried to pull his own t-shirt off his body. He couldn't undress quickly enough, as Brooke eagerly advanced to help him with his shorts, wrestling the job of unzipping his fly from him and greedily taking charge of the big reveal. She squatted before him, yanking off his clothes with one hard tug. She reacted with a sudden laugh as this sent his penis flopping out in front of her face.</p>
<p>Mark felt the sudden rush of freedom he'd only just felt for the first time with Natalie at John's Washing earlier that week. He felt the same thrill of letting Brooke enjoy the sight of his body, the same erotic charge as girls all around him glanced over and stole an eager peek at his penis, then briefly flashed their eyes toward his with an inflamed look of approval.</p>
<p>Brooke stood back up and they observed each other with giddy excitement, devouring the sight of each other's naked bits with increasingly visible ardor.</p>
<p>The roar around them was still deafening. Half of the students had already ripped off their clothes excitedly, while the other half covered their mouths and gawked, hesitant to do it themselves. However, they soon began to catch up, yanking off pieces of clothing or having them yanked off them. Breasts and genitals continued popping out everywhere, each time accompanied by squeals of laughter and the shock of seeing friends share their bodies openly.</p>
<p>In the span of two minutes, Mark became witness to a widespread display of nudity such as he'd never seen before. The Washing at John's place earlier that week had merely the potential to whet one's appetite in the face of the sea of unclothed bodies that soon made their appearance all around him, stretching out in all directions like a vista of flesh. It reminded Mark of the illustrated book that he had been shown when he received "the talk" at a young age. Girls were lined up as if demonstrating the various shapes and sizes of female breasts, as were the men sporting a variety of penises. However, the bodies surrounding him soon shifted from anonymous figures to people he knew and that knew him.</p>
<p>Mark gawked at the shocking sight of girls he saw and interacted with regularly, on their way to and from class, in his lecture halls, some of them even having become friends he talked to at length on a daily basis. Now here they stood, completely nude, briefly scooping and gathering their full breasts in their hands in a last ditch effort to avoid embarrassment before finally relenting and embracing exposure; the intimate, feminine secrets of their bodies on full display for all to see. With an endless curiosity, he observed their boobs; some large and weighty, some small and perky, some with dark nipples, others rosy, flat or protruding. All of them moving, dancing, bouncing free as if mirroring the anxious excitement ushered in through the wild freedom of their shared nudity. He glanced casually at the fascinating variety of pussies, from full, thick lips, to others that were merely blushing slits. Some girls were fully shaven, others sported full bushes, and still others lingered somewhere in between with clean lips beneath a playful tuft of curly hair.</p>
<p>He felt his head spinning as he drowned himself in the spectacle of a small group of Asian girls nearby with their dark wisps tucked in between their pale, buckling legs, as well as a group of punk girls revealing secret tattoos so close to their waxed nether regions that perhaps they'd been chosen purposefully to surprise future lovers. He spied the hippies who threw their arms up into the sunlight and closed their eyes, turning in slow circles while flashing their hairy pits as thick as the fur between their legs, which caught the same sunlight and shone like reddish fire.</p>
<p>It was intoxicating, overwhelming, and stupefying, but equally so for the girls that he observed. He discovered in them the same giddy curiosity, as their eyes danced about the dense, muscular bodies crowded around them, enchanted by a generous masculinity that may as well have resembled a Roman statue hall. He could sense the secret desire building behind their eyes as they studied the clean, rounded lines of their biceps, the hard swell of their chests, and the sturdy thighs that flanked their long, thick cocks which swung loosely between their legs. Cocks truly everywhere, of all shapes and sizes, circumcised, uncircumcised, flopping about like sausages as they laughed and joked with one another.</p>
<p>He observed that Brooke, too, seemed perfectly amused by this extreme liberation. Her eyes sparkled with excitement as she laughed softly and scanned the throngs of unclothed bodies, standing staggered and in rows, with breasts sloping outward to rosy points, and dark, neat triangles of hair tucked between their creamy thighs. At the male chests dusted with a smattering of hair atop toned figures leaning awkwardly to one leg. At their expressions of suspended disbelief, deeply conscious of the dark shadows of pubic hair between their legs from which their manhood emerged.</p>
<p>Mark and Brooke stood side by side, awash in the nervous, giddy laughter and glances cast from side to side. Eyes widening. Pointing. Laughter. Cocks slowly coming alive...</p>
<p>Brooke bent in half to quickly dunk the sponge into their bucket, then squeezed it a few times underwater until it was fully saturated. She stood back up in front of Mark with a feverish enthusiasm and carefully placed the cool, water-logged object against his chest. She ran it back and forth, up and down, until his torso was glistening. Mark watched her eyes, so deeply engrossed in the smooth curve of his pecs, his dark nipples like little red coins, and the little trail of hair beneath his bellybutton. The sponge moved gracefully along his arms and neck. She squeezed it sarcastically over his head. A trail of water zipped down over his brow and danced across the amused curl of his lips. She laughed and kissed them apologetically.</p>
<p>Mark could feel himself beginning to tremble as she began to lower herself, her eyes never leaving his, until the last moment when she faced his pelvis squarely. She gave his cock a teasing glance and then pretended to ignore it as she resaturated the sponge and went to town on his legs. The sponge moved firmly over his lower muscles, curling around his thighs and down to his ankles. Mark gazed downward, past the slowly expanding arc of his penis, observing the meticulous study of his body that Brooke seemed to be engaged in.</p>
<p>Brooke set aside the sponge and grabbed the bar of soap. The familiar fragrance of ocean spray and sweet-smelling blooms engulfed them as she massaged the pearlescent object between her palms until it vanished into a dome of white froth. She then stretched outward against his body, gliding her soapy hands upward along his torso toward his chest and back again. The grin on her face expanded until it lit up her whole face.</p>
<p>Smoothly Brooke's hands navigated Mark's body, rubbing briskly over his thighs, dragging a long stream of suds along the full length of his arms, polishing his back until it was glassy and slick. For a moment, he felt the absence of her gentle fingers as he faced away from her, watching similar events taking place all around him. Then he felt them return. They gripped the tightening muscles of his buttocks, curling around his cheeks and squeezing them sarcastically. He began to laugh. She playfully drummed against them with her palms, as if excited to see his muscles quiver.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Mark flinched as he felt her fingers slip into the warm hollow between his cheeks. It occurred to him that Brooke had slid her fingers deep into his butt crack, washing him thoroughly with soapy fingers. It was intimate and strange the way she touched him there, lathering a nook that only someone who really cared for him would want to venture into. It seemed so shocking a gesture-- such an intimate level of care with which she shared this ritual with him and cleansed his body so thoroughly, completely, all over. As odd a sensation as it was, her willingness to go this far somehow pushed his affections over the edge.</p>
<p>He glanced over his shoulder at her. She gazed up at him lovingly, smiling as if this task were no big deal. He felt his heart soften completely. Mark was lost in her. She had absorbed him through and through. He was hopelessly, helplessly smitten.</p>
<p>Brooke's loving caresses of his body continued until she turned him back around and squatted back down in front of his groin. He registered the fact that there was only one place left to explore. The place he was most sensitive and most eager to experience her adoration. She gazed at his cock as it slowly lifted away from his pelvis with anticipation. A wide smile stretched across her face.</p>
<p>Then, she teasingly denied him the satisfaction. Brooke lifted one of his feet and set it on her knee, then began to deeply engage his big toe. She gave him a suggestive look as if she were polishing off a different body part, the one where he had desired her touch. He grinned at her. She moved from toe to toe, curling her fingers around each one individually and stroking them with a wicked delight.</p>
<p>"My toes? Really?" he laughed.</p>
<p>She winked at him. "Just getting warmed up..."</p>
<p>After a moment, Brooke stood back up and announced the fact that it was his turn to wash her. It was clear that she was being a tease and that he'd have to work for any further enjoyment, so he eagerly grabbed the sponge and set to work, moistening her body just as she had done to him. He squeezed the sponge over her chest and watched the rivulets of water snake down between her breasts and then branch across her stomach. He ran it softly across her arms as she lifted them for him, then down the front and sides of her body.</p>
<p>Mark knelt down before Brooke and began to rub the sponge over her sturdy runner's thighs, though his eyes inevitably wandered between her legs. The soft patch of light brown fur covering her mons looked as if it were sparkling with a dewy moisture. He casually dragged the sponge over her sex, observing the way her pliable, pink flesh separated and stretched at the entrance to her vagina. He heard her exhale a soft sigh through her nose.</p>
<p>Soon Mark had worked up a solid lather in his hands with the bar of soap and squarely confronted her body once again. A thick, raw tension hung between them as he reached forward and moved his hands smoothly over her shoulders and down her arms. He returned them to her neck, caressing it softly and then moved them downward to her chest. A long trail of slick, white suds charted his course as his hands slid over the swelling femininity that blossomed outward between their bodies. Mark navigated her body with devotion, stroking the underside of her large breasts, his fingers curling around the outside, then over the top, rubbing and kneading them in circles. Her spongy flesh compressed eagerly under the gentle pressure of his strokes. He moved over her nipples which pressed back against his happy fingers with a growing firmness as they began to harden and become erect.</p>
<p>A dazed look of calm moved across Brooke's face as she relaxed into his amorous caresses. She reached for his body and her eyes flickered shut, as if in a trance. Mark felt the quivering of her fingers as they began to dig unintentionally into his flesh. He continued to manipulate her puffy, swollen nipples, raised from her breasts and dotted with tiny goosebumps. Her hands slid up the sides of his body. He heard her moan softly.</p>
<p>Mark grew briefly self-conscious, becoming fully aware that Brooke and he were beginning to grow increasingly amorous in public. He wondered what people would think if they discovered them beginning to explore each other in ways that went beyond the simple act of making each other clean. However, as he observed those gathered around him, he discovered that his excitement was not quite so unusual.</p>
<p>On all sides he observed squealing girls darting left and right in a fit of hysterics as guys squirted them with water, driven to the limits of their own crazed excitement by the uncontrolled movement of the boobs which lurched up and down in front of bare chests. It had become a free-for-all. The guys chased after the girls, already sporting massive erections pointed squarely in their directions. Young women everywhere ducked behind one another as if feigning fear of impalement by their impressive, fleshy projections. Bodies moved wildly in a sea of soapy bubbles. Softly wobbling, naked bums dripped with suds as their owners romped about with wild laughter and experienced the shocking sensation of having their slippery flesh massaged and rubbed by their amused friends.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the fact that he was not alone with his voyeuristic arousal, Mark continued his fervent mission to offer Brooke a sense of sensual pleasure matching that which she had offered him. His hands traveled the length of her body, executing the double task of lathering her up and at the same time massaging any remaining tension from her muscles. When he completed the safe zones of her front, Mark rotated Brooke's body and replenished his supply of soap.</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>He quickly placed his hands against her buttocks, which emitted a soft slapping sound upon contact. The two mounds gently quivered in a way far different from how they had reacted to John's violent strike. One at a time he began to work the malleable globes of flesh in his hands which yielded to his intense curiosity. He scooped one cheek upward and then another, lifting them away from the warm valley of her sex below and providing him with a brief flash of her sweetly puckered anus. As the suds slid lazily into the channel between them, he followed them there, inspired by her earlier mission to treat no spot of his body as off limits.</p>
<p>After moving upward along her back and then kneading the knots of tension from her shoulders, Mark turned Brooke back around. She seemed to be drowning in a sea of blissful relaxation, lost in the lingering sensation of his hands still patterned whimsically across her naked body. Her heavy eyelids slowly closed and then lifted back open, absorbed in the sight of his face as it gazed back at her. Mark pulled her close. An aura of warmth clouded her body and he soon became trapped in its magnetic pull.</p>
<p>Together they shared a pure moment of feeling safe with each other. Safe enough to bear their bodies openly in front of everyone. To dismiss their personal gripes about their appearance; Brooke about her thighs, Mark about the slight gut he felt he was forming. It felt good for them to see themselves through the other's eyes and discover how needlessly critical they could sometimes be toward themselves; to feel unquestionably sexy in the eyes of another.</p>
<p>Mark's hand slipped downward. He felt the flat plane of her stomach deflating under his touch and then rising again quickly. Still searching her eyes, he continued to venture bravely downward until he felt the sudden texture of feathery hair. Mark's fingers slipped smoothly over her pussy. The pink trail of her labia through the center of her pubic hair parted willingly to his advances. The wrinkly, roseate flesh curled over his fingers, inviting them smoothly into her moist, satiny interior. The warm heat of her sex stood in stark contrast to the coolness of the soapy water that coated them.</p>
<p>Brooke gave a startled reaction. "Wow, okay. Gettin' right down to it!" she laughed.</p>
<p>Mark suddenly pulled away and began trembling. "Oh! I'm sorry! Natalie-- she said to wash her there too, and I--"</p>
<p>Brooke threw her head back and started laughing harder. She placed her hand on Mark's shoulder. "I'm totally messing with you!" she chuckled. "Of course you can touch me there." Mark let out a sigh of relief as she grinned back at him. "I'm sorry, that was mean of me," she added with a guilty look.</p>
<p>Brooke reached down and grasped Mark's hand. Slowly, she guided it back between her legs and straddled him wider. Mark took over and began to stroke her pussy. She let go and relaxed into it, tucking her head into his neck. "Mmm, that's good. Wash me right there. I've been dirty..." she joked, to calm his nerves. Mark could feel her wry grin lengthen against his neck as she nuzzled against it.</p>
<p>His heart started to race as he slipped his fingers back and forth through her liquid folds. She needed no soap, no water; Brooke seemed to be generating more than enough of her own lubrication. Within just a few moments he could already hear the sound of her body squeaking in response to his brisk movements. Brooke's face pressed more firmly into his neck. Her breathing grew heavy.</p>
<p>Mark's fingers continued to slip back and forth over her mons as her legs began to buckle. Her budding clit began to press back against his dripping fingers as he heard her begin to whimper.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, Mark..." she whispered, utterly defenseless and surrendering to him. He kept going, increasing his speed. "Mark... Careful! You might make me-- ngh!" Brooke began to grow unsteady, leaning into him with her whole body, as if needing his support to remain upright. Still, he continued. She wrapped her arm around him suddenly, squeezing him tight and gasping as if struggling for air.</p>
<p>He wondered if her embrace was meant to hide the embarrassing signs of her arousal, or if she was simply relenting to such an intense desire that she could barely stand on two feet. Suddenly, he heard her groaning into his neck, trying to muffle the sound. Mark felt her body jerk to life, spasming wildly against his. He slowed his fingers down to a gentle caress as she mashed her pelvis against his hand, gushing unexpectedly.</p>
<p>"Wh-- whoa," she exhaled, still supporting herself with his body and struggling to catch her breath. After a few moments, she lifted her chin and gazed up at him. He found himself witness to a longing that he'd not seen in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Good?" he asked with a smirk.</p>
<p>A beautiful smile lit up Brooke's entire face. She grasped his head and frantically steered his face to her lips. There they began to kiss frantically, burdened by a deep reservoir of desire that they'd allowed to build a little too long. He tasted the sweet warmth of her tongue and found himself weakening in their mutual embrace.</p>
<p>Mark saw a flash of delight sparkle in her eyes as he tugged her closer to him. Their bodies pressed together, slipping against one another with a viscous friction from the thin layer of soap between them. They shifted their bodies back and forth like a slip-n-slide while frantically seeking each other's lips again. Brooke's firm breasts moved against his chest like smooth pillows trapped under pressure, searching for a means to pop free and restore themselves to their natural shape. He could smell her all over him, knowing that the slick liquid coating their flesh was undoubtedly now mixed with traces of her cum.</p>
<p>As Brooke nipped at his lip, growing ever more hungry for him, she felt the fierce rigidity of his penis pressing into her stomach. Realizing for the first time that he was standing at full attention, she frantically reached down and fished for his cock. As she made contact, a smile briefly disrupted their kiss. Mark shivered with delight as she squeezed his shaft and sighed wistfully. She pulled away slightly, releasing her glossy, shiny breasts, and smiling at the sight of the object she'd just found.</p>
<p>Brooke's hands glided outward along his shaft to circle his cockhead and then cruised smoothly back toward the hard wall of his body, allowing his swollen manhood to bloom like a spear from the core of her tight grip. She lowered herself in front of him with a look of deep fascination, beginning the thumb the sensitive underside of his penis, expertly controlling his level of pleasure and occasionally offsetting it with a small amount of pressure to prevent his need for release.</p>
<p>Loosened up by an orgasm, Brooke started to get goofy. "Can I ask you something I've always wondered?" she asked excitedly.</p>
<p>"Sure!" Mark replied.</p>
<p>"How do guys wash their penises? Like, if you soap it up and then rub it off, does that mean that you're basically just masturbating? Do you just masturbate in the shower to get clean?"</p>
<p>Mark laughed. "I never thought about it that way."</p>
<p>"Well, I mean, there's not much difference, right?"</p>
<p>"I dunno... if it were simply like that, group showers after gym class would have been interesting!"</p>
<p>Brooke giggled. "Yes! Did you all just stand around milking yourselves like cows?"</p>
<p>"Well... do you want it to be that way? Is that your fantasy?" Mark snickered.</p>
<p>"Yes!" she laughed.</p>
<p>"Okay, then yes. Yes, we all just stand around jerking off together," he chuckled.</p>
<p>"Good," she said, simply, returning her efforts to manipulating his erect cock with a passionate enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be the same for girls? Do you just stand there whipping your fingers back and forth between your legs together?"</p>
<p>"Naw... it's different," she muttered, with a playful grin.</p>
<p>"Darn..." said Mark.</p>
<p>"... we stand around doing it to each other," she joked. They both started laughing.</p>
<p>"We're so full of shit," she chuckled. "Why is life never as exciting as you imagine it?"</p>
<p>"There's no reason it shouldn't be."</p>
<p>"True! Let's make a pact to make life more kinky and exciting," Brooke insisted.</p>
<p>"I'm in!" Mark exclaimed.</p>
<p>He felt himself leaking slightly as Brooke's eager strokes drew the first signs of cum from his throbbing cock, but it mixed immediately into the lather and vanished without a trace. She focused intently on the tip of his swollen, reddish glans as it emerged from the tight canal of her fist and zipped back inside again. She began to twist in half circles around his steely shaft, causing his legs to weaken. He placed a hand on her shoulder and hung his head over her, breathing heavily and losing control in the same manner that she had.</p>
<p>Brooke continued to gaze at the swollen, knob-like head of his cock pointing outward toward her face. She paused to lift it and rub the underside to carefully stimulate him, then enclosed her first around it again and spun it in a circle around his reddish seam. She pushed back against his body, driving it through the tight hole of her fist, lubricated excessively with soap, and then tugged it back toward her in a smooth twisting motion until the tip of his penis slipped back through the small hollow of her palm once again.</p>
<p>With firm, slow strokes she massaged the full length of his cock, sending waves of tingling pleasure surging through his shaft. A shiny, semi-translucent bubble of liquid began to ooze from his tip as he moaned softly. Brooke eyed it with curiosity and satisfaction at the telltale sign of his arousal. She began to detect the slight, earthy musk of his body creeping through the fresh tang of the soap and began to grow drowsy on the emerging scent of deep masculine pleasure. As her grasp tightened and strained against the hardness of his cock, she could feel its slow throb beating back against her fingers, conveying the quick regularity of his heartbeat.</p>
<p>She changed the direction of her rotation, altered her speed, and varied the pressure until she could see his legs beginning to buckle beyond control.</p>
<p>"Okay..." he gasped. "I'm almost..."</p>
<p>"Sorry," she laughed. "I got carried away."</p>
<p>"That's okay," he replied with a grin, trying to collect himself.</p>
<p>"Hey!" they heard a voice shout from behind. "I'm missing all the fun!"</p>
<p>They turned and saw the petite, naked form of Natalie skipping over to their side. Her perky little boobs wiggled back and forth as if greeting them with a wave. Brooke's eyes lit up upon seeing her friend and then embraced for a hug. Mark watched the two naked girls in each other's arms with a devilish grin, which Natalie soon returned. After hugging Brooke she hopped over to his side and offered him the same squeeze.</p>
<p>A dark, brooding young man came up behind Natalie. He was a handsome, quiet, submissive boy-toy that Mark didn't recognize. Natalie welcomed the visitor enthusiastically and introduced him to the group as Cason. Mark and Brooke welcomed him over. They began to talk excitedly about the experience of being nude together as if it was for the first time.</p>
<p>Before long, Mark spotted Trevon coming toward them, sporting an erection of his own. For a moment, Mark felt the shock of nudity return, catching sight of his own roommate's gigantic, stiff cock bobbing in front of his body. However, he quickly brushed it off, aware that he and Cason were equally pronounced in front of the girls. The gorgeous young figure of Shayna shyly approached the group alongside him. Mark immediately registered that he was witnessing her nude for the first time. Her large, swinging breasts and dainty, hairless sex made it no surprise that Trevon was wildly aroused.</p>
<p>Natalie saw them approach and squealed. She grabbed a bucket and playfully tossed suds at them both. They laughed and fought back with a few splashes of their own. Natalie dove after Trevon, briefly saying, "May I?" to Shayna who giggled and nodded.</p>
<p>Mark chuckled as Natalie grabbed Trevon's long cock and gave it a few excited strokes. He noticed Cason laughing too and was amazed at the sexual openness that he and his friends could apparently share as a group.</p>
<p>Natalie shouted, "Guys! I've got me some black and I'm never going back!"</p>
<p>The whole group erupted into laughter as Trevon beamed proudly. Shayna approached Mark and stood by his side, watching Natalie begin to rub Trevon down with soap. "Go on, give 'em a try," he shouted over to Mark.</p>
<p>Mark glanced at Brooke, who was still grinning and didn't seem to care. He lathered his hands with soap and stepped back over to Shayna. She laughed and shyly offered up her chest. Her breasts were sensational. He coated them with a thick layer of suds and then fashioned a makeshift bra using two odd white dollops, then took a step back and left her there giggling.</p>
<p>"Nice work, Picasso!" Brooke laughed.</p>
<p>"Thanks!" Mark said, pretending to observe his work with a critical eye.</p>
<p>"This is fun, I'm glad we ended up doing this together," she admitted.</p>
<p>"Yeah. It's a good thing that you and Shayna decided at the last minute to go with us, 'cuz otherwise I'd have to settle for taking Trevon." He sarcastically wiped his brow.</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. They embraced again and then joined in the fun, splashing and rubbing each other down interchangeably, sharing their bodies intimately with one another until the festivities began to draw to a close.</p>
<p>Saturday was going to be sublime. Mark could just feel it. He'd made plans to hang out at Brooke's house, cozying up on the couch to watch artsy foreign films which he had begun to enjoy but had no one to share with yet. Brooke spoke excitedly about some of her favorites, rattling off a few from Godard, Fellini, and Buuel. It wasn't officially a date, but it was still clearly a date.</p>
<p>He laughed at how topsy-turvy their burgeoning relationship was. An orgasm came first. Watching a movie together, second. Mark didn't care if it made sense or not. Just that it was happening.</p>
<p>They met at an old train-car diner at the edge of the campus for breakfast, talking excitedly over coffee. It was a morning ritual that was fast becoming something they enjoyed sharing. Then they stepped out into the sunshine and made their way back through a dandelion meadow toward Brooke's place, enjoying the warm breeze of a beautiful summer morning.</p>
<p>"That was so wild yesterday!" exclaimed Brooke, finally having the nerve to bring up the topic.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it was fun! I still can't believe that it happens, even after experiencing it myself."</p>
<p>"I'm so glad I got rid of John in time," she laughed. "Otherwise we'd not have had an opportunity to do it together."</p>
<p>"Me too." Mark hesitated for a moment, then continued. "If you don't mind me saying so... I wasn't all that impressed with the way he treated you at your Washing."</p>
<p>"Oh god," she groaned, as if desperate to let one out. "That was the last straw, I think. To be fair, he's not always that bad, but as soon as he's around his friends and wants to show off, he's unbearable. Good riddance!"</p>
<p>Mark became thoughtful for a moment. Brooke was being open with him, but he was still burning to understand something and wasn't sure how willing she was to share with him. "... Can I ask you something personal?" he asked cautiously.</p>
<p>"Sure, of course."</p>
<p>"Well... I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I've always been sorta confused as to how you ended up with him. I mean... to be honest, I'm kinda in awe of you. You always seem to have stuff figured out. I can be a mess sometimes. I don't know how you're so confident, but it's a wonderful trait and you're really lucky. But John... your relationship with him seemed to run counter to everything else. -- Sorry, you probably don't want to talk about it."</p>
<p>"No, it's okay. You're right," she laughed. Mark felt instantly relieved that she responded with a sense of humor about the whole thing. "I get it. Honestly, I knew it was a mistake soon after we started going out and I saw how he really was."</p>
<p>"So what compelled you then? If you don't mind me asking."</p>
<p>"You really want to know?" she said, becoming equally pensive.</p>
<p>"It's up to you. I don't mean to pry."</p>
<p>"No, it's okay. It feels good to vent." Brooke scratched her head for a moment, then continued, "For all the nice things you said about me, the truth is that I'm fucking terrified of loneliness. You know what I mean?" Mark nodded. "I mean... No one should be reliant on another human being to feel good about themselves. But it's just hard sometimes. I'm hard on myself."</p>
<p>"Well, everyone has an Achilles heel. We're all terrified of something. Hell, every time I try to think of what the future has in store for me, I still see one big question mark looming over a bleak and endless void." They both laughed at this admission.</p>
<p>"But you'll figure it out in time. Everyone does." Brooke said this with a renewed defiance against the world. He could see the warrior spirit returning to her, which he cherished so much.</p>
<p>"I hope so," he replied with a smile.</p>
<p>Soon they reached the apartment Brooke rented with a few friends she had made freshman year. Together, they started up the path toward the front door.</p>
<p>"Remember I told you what the Washing meant to me? To women?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"John robbed me of that experience the other day. You gave it back to me yesterday, and I'm grateful for that."</p>
<p>Mark grinned at her. "My pleasure."</p>
<p>Brooke unlocked the front door and they walked inside. It didn't appear anyone else was home. She closed the front door behind her and resumed her confession as if she had needed to get something off her chest.</p>
<p>"I think John just played into my weakness and I fell for an easy escape. Maybe I knew it was a terrible relationship, but that freed me from having to build anything with him. I could just receive his attention and feel better, you know? But I didn't really..."</p>
<p>"Right. I don't blame you. Sometimes, in the moment, that's an attractive option."</p>
<p>"Yeah. I mean, he's obviously easy to look at. I guess it was kinda like taking a cheat day when you're on a diet." She laughed. "Once in a while everyone slips and downs a little too much junk food. -- I'm definitely over it though. I could use something a little more soul-satisfying. Someone good looking who ALSO has substance."</p>
<p>Mark chuckled. She smirked at him.</p>
<p>"Good," Mark said. "Honestly, someone like you deserves better. And just because you feel the need to be with someone, that doesn't mean you can't function independently, think for yourself, and excel at being you. Anyone who gets to share that with you is lucky."</p>
<p>As genuine as his feelings were, Mark felt awkward trying to share them, especially with someone he was so taken with. "I really mean that," he added, out of fear that she might think he was just praising her to get something in return.</p>
<p>Brooke paused for a moment, then stopped and looked directly into his eyes. A large smile formed on her face. "I know," she simply said, with confidence. She stroked his arm and then grabbed his hand to lead him toward the kitchen. "Beer before movie!" she blurted.</p>
<p>"Hey-- are you okay that I... that we... you know... got a little kinky yesterday?" Mark asked while being tugged along. "The other day you made it sound like the Washing isn't a sexual thing for you like it clearly is for Natalie. But then..."</p>
<p>Brooke burst out laughing. "Oh! No! I didn't say that! It's extremely sexy. Wasn't that... err... obvious? I seem to recall enjoying someone else giving me an experience worth remembering..."</p>
<p>Mark chuckled. "Yeah, I guess you're right."</p>
<p>"The point is, I can choose for myself what I want to get out of it; what kind of experience it is. As can you. As can each of us. Neither the circumstances nor the people attending should dictate that for us. We felt our way there together, naturally, and it was wonderful."</p>

<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>"Yeah, it was. Sorry, I'm just a little... I dunno..."</p>
<p>"Nervous," she laughed. "But I'm glad we both got to vent a little. Heck, that's the spirit of the Washing. It's good to purge once in a while because, at the end of the day, life is messy. Relationships are messy." She opened the door to the fridge and pulled out a can of beer. "Everything's one big mess that needs constant cleaning up. But you know what I realized this week?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I'm okay with that. The ritual is not about becoming permanently clean. It's also about acknowledging that this entire circus is just a part of life and that we're always able to face it, to make things work. To make sense of it all."</p>
<p>Mark grinned. "How very Fellini-esque of you!"</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "Touch!" She grasped the beer in her hand and reached for the tab to pop it for him. All of a sudden, beer exploded in her face, showering her with suds.</p>
<p>Mark burst out laughing, then apologized between laughs. "I can't help it," he explained, "The irony was so perfectly timed..."</p>
<p>Brooke snickered and handed him the dripping can of beer. "Oh, it's like that, is it? Funny, funny..." She reached for another can and shook it a few times.</p>
<p>"Hey, hey, hey..." Mark said, backing away. "Wait a sec..." Brooke started to aim it at him with a wicked grin. "Wait!" He darted to the side and then made a run for the doorway, but Brooke chased after him, laughing. "Can't we talk about this?" he chuckled, finding himself backed into the corner in the living room.</p>
<p>"Sure-- after I even the playing field!" she exclaimed, opening the can in his direction. It hissed and fired a small jet of beer at him, died down, and dribbled over her fingers. They both continued laughing at how much of a mess they'd made, then each took a swig. Brooke looked down at herself. Large wet patches had formed all over her shirt and shorts.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess you'll have to take off that shirt," Mark joked.</p>
<p>"Hmph! So will you!"</p>
<p>Mark snickered and pulled his off, then stood bare-chested before Brooke. She stared at him with an equally mischievous glint in her eye, then yanked her off and stood before him in her bra.</p>
<p>"Oops, your bra is wet too. You might have to take that off as well," he continued.</p>
<p>Brooke looked down at her bra in surprise, finding it completely dry. "Huh? No it isn't--" She suddenly felt a cold mist of beer shoot across her chest again like ocean spray. She looked up and found Mark standing there with his can aimed at her again.</p>
<p>"Now it is..." he said with a devilish grin.</p>
<p>Brooke's jaw dropped and then spread into a wild grin. "Oh, you're gonna get it now!" she snapped.</p>
<p>Mark laughed and shielded himself without knowing what was coming. Brooke lurched forward and grabbed him, pinning him to her body. All of a sudden Mark felt a cold trickle of beer land on his head, snake through his hair, and then zip down his forehead. It began to pool on his lips, but Brooke leaned forward and licked it off them. They both continued laughing.</p>
<p>"Now I look like I pissed myself," Mark remarked, seeing a puddle of beer pooled on the floor by their feet.</p>
<p>"Gosh, I know you're nervous around me, but I didn't realize you were THAT nervous," she teased. "Anyway, don't worry, my roommates won't be home any time soon." She began to push him backward toward the couch, splashing beer along the way.</p>
<p>"Won't the couch get beer all over it?"</p>
<p>"It's already got beer all over it," she replied as she pinned him down onto the couch. She took another big gulp of beer and then began to kiss him. Mark found himself frantic for her lips, just as he had briefly been the day before. After a few minutes of passion, Brooke flinched and yanked herself away from his lips. A small stream of beer made its way over her face and down her chest.</p>
<p>"Okay, I deserved that," she laughed.</p>
<p>Mark lowered his beer can back down and took another swig, chuckling the whole time.</p>
<p>Brooke shifted uncomfortably. "Beer in my cooch, that's a first."</p>
<p>"Hmm, I can think of a fun way to resolve that problem," he replied. Brooke snickered as she set the beer on the floor and hastily removed her bra. Mark set his beer down on the floor as well.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, I'm all sticky!" she giggled, waving her hands.</p>
<p>Mark gazed at the way her breasts swayed rapidly back and forth as she did this. She caught him doing this, laughed softly, and ran her hands over his chest. "I can also think of a fun way to make you more sticky..." he added.</p>
<p>Brooke started laughing harder. "Stop, you're making my chest hurt!" she managed to say between laughs while holding her stomach.</p>
<p>He grinned and rolled his eyes. "Get your head out of the gutter. I was just talking about grabbing the whipped cream. Or maybe chocolate syrup."</p>
<p>She groaned. "Oh man, chocolate syrup..."</p>
<p>"And ice cream?"</p>
<p>"Too cold!" she exclaimed. "But every good sundae comes with a nice handful of nuts..." Mark groaned sarcastically at her pun. Brooke became thoughtful. A wicked look flashed across her face. "And if you want..." she added, biting her lip, "... you can go looking for my cherry."</p>
<p>Mark could feel his heart pounding in his chest. Brooke gazed down at him, half-naked, her soft hair training gently across his bare chest, her glossy red lips still freshly moistened. He reacted suddenly, quickly tackling her until she fell backward onto the couch, full of giggles. She reached out and began to wrestle off his shorts while he worked rapidly at hers.</p>
<p>He leaned down and began to kiss her breasts, his hungry breath washing over her dancing nipples as they both struggled to remove the rest of their clothing. They finished tugging each other's shorts off. Brooke ran her palm over the visible bulge in the front of his boxers. Her laughs gave way to a smile, a trembling jaw, a rapidly expanding and contracting chest. She tugged down his boxers and delighted in the appearance of his stiff cock as it bounced into view.</p>
<p>Mark grasped excitedly at the waistband of her panties and slipped them down over her thighs, revealing the little vertex of curly hair followed by the pinkish, pursed lips of her outer labia. He began to breathe rapidly, aroused again by the intimate view of her body. The sensation was different. No longer were they standing apart in the company of others. He felt the weight of his naked body bearing down upon hers, the warmth of her soft flesh upon his.</p>
<p>Her legs splayed open and then enclosed around his body, trapping him like an insect. She drew him down to her body, still yearning for his lips. They kissed feverishly until Mark broke free and began to nibble at her neck, then make his way down over her breasts, treating them to the same pleasure. He traveled further still, finding her soft navel with his tongue. Brooke writhed and whimpered beneath his body as he cherished every inch of hers.</p>
<p>The mildly lemony, hoppy scent of beer still lingered on her skin, having left small trails down her body toward her groin. The refreshing scent of her exploded drink filled his nostrils until he reached her vulva and a new scent broke through. The beautiful, earthy scent of her cassoulette emerged as he found himself face to face with her expanding sex. He reached forward with his fingers and spread her lips even wider, opening the faint ring of hair that encircled her genitals to reveal a smooth, glistening pink interior.</p>
<p>Mark ran his nose along the sweet divide of her pussy, enjoying the clean fragrance of her sex. A thousand bars of Azure Bay had nothing on her heavenly feminine aroma. He sweetly kissed her clitoral hood, nuzzling it with his lips and nibbling at hers. Brooke began to squirm. Mark's tongue zipped with ease over the dewy gloss of her inner flesh as he began to navigate the sweet nooks of her body, teasing apart her folds, exploring her warm depths, teasing her clit until it came alive under the playful pressure of his tongue.</p>
<p>For several minutes Mark helped himself to the nexus of her pleasure, awash in her liquid delight, his chin dripping as he tugged gently at her lips and gently sucked her clit. A series of long, slow licks set her about purring like a cat, her body moving with fierce animation, occasionally jolting to life as he worked hard to spark sensations of bliss. Soon she was drunk on his efforts and fueled by an outpouring of emotion she frantically reached for his body.</p>
<p>Brooke aggressively lured Mark back to her mouth, anxious to taste on his lips the evidence of her recent satisfaction. Her own scent flooded her nostrils and opened the erotic channels of her body even wider. Grinding her body against his, she toyed with his tongue and swept her fingers through his hair. Mark felt her hand searching again for his member, which she then began to tug with a growing hunger. The hiss of a deep inhale roared through her teeth.</p>
<p>"God, I love your cock..." she growled.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?" Mark muttered.</p>
<p>"Ngh, yeah..." She narrowed her burning eyes at him. "I want to kiss it," she snapped, pushing him backward.</p>
<p>Mark laid back against the pillows at the end of the couch, letting his cock bounce up into the air. Brooke slid forward and eagerly recovered it, capturing with a tight grasp and leaning forward. She planted a series of hungry kisses at the tip and then down along his shaft. Then she plunged it into her mouth. Mark felt as if he was sinking into the couch as it slid smoothly over her wet tongue.</p>
<p>Brooke worked at him with resolute determination, massaging his steely hard member in the warm cavity of her mouth and adapting her speed and pressure in response to his delicious torment. Finally, with great satisfaction, Brooke let Mark's cock pop out of her mouth. A thin cord of saliva traveled from her lips to his tip, then snapped. As if recalling a joke, a wide grin spread across Brooke's face. Mark could see her turning inward, relishing some amusing thought.</p>
<p>"What?" he asked.</p>
<p>She looked up and met his eyes, studying them for a moment, then raised one finger into the air. "Just a sec..." Brooke suddenly sprang from the couch and hurried back into the kitchen, leaving Mark behind to wonder what was going on. He heard a cabinet opening and then shut. In the distance, there was a quiet snap of plastic.</p>
<p>Moments later Brooke entered the frame of the doorway with her hands behind her back. Her long, nude form rested casually against the edge of the doorway. The wry grin had not left her face.</p>
<p>"So... How serious were you?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"How serious were you earlier?"</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"About... chocolate!" she laughed, pulling an open bottle of chocolate sauce out from behind her back.</p>
<p>Mark laughed. "I'm game!" Brooke skipped back over to the couch and climbed back atop him. She began to shake the bottle. "Oh man, we're gonna make such a--" Mark continued, relieved that at least the fabric was black and would be unfazed by the likes of chocolate. The bottle blurted an unattractive sound and liquid chocolate suddenly squirted across his chest. Brooke giggled gleefully. "So much for getting clean, eh?" Mark chuckled as Brooke began to run her fingers through the chocolate coating his muscles.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll get you clean. Don't worry," she mused. "Soap and water is just one way, but that's not what a pussycat prefers."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Pussycats like to use their tongue..."</p>
<p>Brooke leaned down and began to run her tongue smoothly over his chest, spreading a long, wet trail of chocolate sauce across it. Her tongue traveled over his nipple, coating it in a sweet, sugary glaze.</p>
<p>"Mmm..." she cooed, before smacking her lips.</p>
<p>She crawled back up his body and offered him a kiss. Moments after their lips touched he tasted the sweet flavor of cocoa begin to spread across his tongue. He felt Brooke shaking the bottle again to loosen the sauce that had been settling in the bottle. Brooke's eyes danced about as she sat back up and went to work squeezing the bottle as it hovered over Mark's penis.</p>
<p>The bottle squirted again and sent a flood of gooey chocolate sauce splashing across his swollen member. It began to drip down the sides of his long, upright shaft until it was streaked with a sweet gloss. Brooke dove forward, slipping him smoothly back into her mouth. She sucked and licked at his body as if it were candy, relishing every drop of her dessert until there was no evidence left that he had been doused at all.</p>
<p>"Okay, that's my new favorite snack," Brooke giggled.</p>
<p>Mark laughed, "Yum, yum, gimme some."</p>
<p>He snatched the bottle from her hand and sat Brooke back against the pillows. Mark aimed the bottle toward her chest and gave it a few hard squeezes. Gobs of thick chocolate splashed across her breasts, coating her nipples and streaming over the bulbous swell of her chest. Mark quickly ran his tongue up and over the soft mounds of her breasts, dragging it through the sugary coating that briefly stained her flesh. Reaching her nipples, he sucked at them like sweet candy buttons, listening to Brooke sigh with pleasure.</p>
<p>Mark cupped her breasts, covered in a shiny, sticky coating, devoted to the task of licking them clean. Her delicate, tacky skin clung to his fingers. They softly wobbled beneath the pressure of his restless mouth as it savored every inch. Brooke wrapped her arms around him, holding him tightly to her breast as if enraged with a possessive ecstasy.</p>
<p>"Okay, I can't stand it anymore," she groaned.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>She grasped his face and gave him a hard stare. "I don't know how I made it through two Washings with you without jumping your bone, but I'm sure as hell not going to wait any longer," she blurted out.</p>
<p>Brooke pushed Mark back onto the sofa until he was lying flat and then straddled over his pelvis. She grasped his cock and lowered herself on top of him until it sunk inch by inch into her body with a smooth submersion. A low moan escaped her lips as she closed her eyes and felt his swollen member plunge through the tight recesses of her body to fill her completely. She placed her hands upon his chest where they adhered to his still sticky flesh, then began to rock her hips back and forth.</p>
<p>Mark gazed up at Brooke as she vanished momentarily into a blissful haze, lost somewhere behind her own eyelids. Her gorgeous, round breasts hung heavily before his eyes, swaying nimbly from side to side, still flecked with small specks of chocolate syrup. He reached up and gently squeezed them, tenderly wiping the last remaining bits of treacle from her body, as she moved smoothly back and forth against his body. With each assertive gyration, he felt her usher his cock a little deeper, her inner muscles enclosing around his throbbing shaft, milking him feverishly from within her warm depths.</p>
<p>Brooke was beaming, rocking her head about as if intoxicated, her soft hair falling in waves over his body. She grew more restless with hunger, her hips moving with a more exaggerated motion, a whimsical fluidity that expressed a passionate yearning for his body to connect deeply with her own.</p>
<p>"Mark..." she sighed, her voice quaking with frenzy as she caressed his face lovingly. She could feel him throbbing inside her, a deep, angry pulse that only her liquid emissions could soothe. Brooke leaned down over him until her jostling breasts found a home against his chest. Their lips connected again. She found herself drowning in him.</p>
<p>Mark wrapped Brooke in his embrace. Their sticky bodies faintly crackled as they moved together. Her hips flicked wildly against his with an urgent desire for pleasure. Riding a wave of raw, sexual energy together, their bodies moved quickly into a new formation as Brooke rolled onto her hands and knees and Mark took over. He sat upright on his knees and Brooke pressed her hips backward against his pelvis, thrusting his cock deep inside her from behind.</p>
<p>Brooke's butt quivered as Mark's hips slapped back and forth against her body, plunging his thick cock deeper and deeper. Brooke's groans became muffled as she mashed her face into the pillows with a wild outburst of pleasure. His cock glided swiftly through her sopping, hairy pussy, penetrating the wet suction of her humid cavity where her muscles tightened around his pulsing cock. As it emerged again, he found it slick and fragrant with her cum, mixed with the faint odor of sweet chocolate still lingering on her body.</p>
<p>"Fuck, fuck, Mark..." she moaned as he frantically drove himself through her depths. As he steadied himself against the soft mounds of her buttocks, a faint imprint of his hands appeared, leaving behind a sticky chocolate pattern on her cheeks.</p>
<p>Mark flipped Brooke over. Her eyes flashed up at him with a rabid lust. She flung her legs apart and invited him back inside her. Mark positioned his cock back at the entrance of her pussy, spreading her sodden lips apart and guiding himself smoothly back into her liquid hollow. As he began to thrust quickly back and forth he reached out and offered Brooke his fingers, evenly coated in a mixture of her juices and the sweet chocolate syrup still stippled over their bodies.</p>
<p>Brooke sucked hungrily at his fingers, moaning softly. After licking them clean she whimpered, "Wow, we're so kinky!"</p>
<p>Mark laughed, "I know! I like this side of you!"</p>
<p>Brooke giggled. "Really?" Her eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>"Yeah. You're clearly feeling rather... saucy today," he joked.</p>
<p>Brooke groaned at his pun. "Oh, just shut up and fuck me," she laughed. Mark leaned forward and began to drive his cock furiously through her sopping, tight hole, penetrating her with a zealous passion. She placed her hands on his chest, holding steady his straining body.</p>
<p>"Ngh! Mark!" she screamed, barely able to withstand the force and pleasure of his thrusts.</p>
<p>"Brooke..." he moaned, dizzy with lust and driven wild by the sight of her dancing breasts.</p>
<p>"Ohhh fuck!" she wailed, frantically urging her hips against his in an attempt to maximize their pleasure. "Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!" she continued to scream, whipping her head from side to side. Her shining hair fell across her face, clinging to her sweaty cheeks as they turned flush with indulgence. A wave of pleasure tore through her body, crackling like a bolt of lightning and disrupting every cell in her body. She felt herself cry out, but it was as if she'd falling through a deep hole, momentarily leaving all sight and sound behind. Then she came roaring back, gasping for air.</p>
<p>Mark groaned and pulled himself from her body. Brooke became alert, breathing rapidly. She reached out and frantically grasped for his cock. He continued to groan as she feverishly jerked him off, tugging wildly at his cock, still slick from her own body's emissions. She could feel him throbbing in her hand, hot with a burning desire for release. The earthy musk of his body bloomed around her as she felt him tense up. Then he let out a loud groan.</p>
<p>Brooke frantically milked his cock as he began to squirt eager jets of warm cum across her breasts. She felt his body soften and weaken as he quaked with pleasure. The scent of fresh semen flooded her nostrils, enlivening her senses and waking her up to the sudden reality of the beautiful union they'd just shared. Brooke threw her arms around him, drawing him down to her body where he collapsed against her breast in a fit of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Mark felt the comfort of being cradled in her arms, the soft dance of her kisses over his face, and the warm glow of her body. A tender, sleepy bliss washed over him and he felt as if he could stay there forever.</p>
<p>He smiled softly, then joked, "I guess your head was in the gutter after all."</p>
<p>Brooke snickered. "Yeah, okay... I guess you were right."</p>
<p>For a few minutes, they lingered in silence, reveling in their post-coital bliss.</p>
<p>Finally, Brooke lifted Mark's chin. She was grinning again.</p>
<p>"Well... you know what we need now, right?" she asked.</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>"What?" Mark replied.</p>
<p>Brooke's big, beautiful blue eyes were shining with a sinister excitement. As if she had already communicated the answer to Mark telepathically, they both shouted in unison:</p>
<p>"A shower!"</p>
