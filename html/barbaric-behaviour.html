<p>The following takes place in a fairly generic D&amp;D-like fantasy world. D&amp;D spells and fighting styles are referenced, but I hope I have made everything accessible to people unfamiliar with the mechanics.</p>
<p>"I just don't understand, no member of the bowstring has ever volunteered to be the yew cores." A stern elven commander sighed at me. I couldn't give him the real reason, he'd never understand. Ever since this strange alliance, elves and dwarves working together to repel the threat of men, we all were suddenly out of our comfort zone. We were wedded to a novel military strategy, the elven units (referred to as the bowstring) were archers and mages that supported from behind, while the dwarven fighters and barbarians formed units known as arrowpoints to break the lines and push the invaders back.</p>
<p>But keeping us so strictly separate was bad for cohesion and bred resentment that elves got all the assistance magic, so there are the yew cores, elven mages placed in the arrowpoints to give magical assistance to their raw fury. It was well known that only elves that had pissed off the wrong people ended up in the yew cores, so nobody could understand why I wanted to join.</p>
<p>I've heard the term whirlwind romance before, I understand it's meant to represent a sudden tumultuous crash of emotions, but I don't think it fits. The storm brews, the wind picks up, and you can see the whirlwind coming, it is something only a fool is totally unprepared for. My romance was more like a bolt of lightning from a cloudless sky.</p>
<p>Like most elves, I first met dwarves in our shared army camps and mess halls. We would make small talk in passing but that barrier seemed insurmountable, so we did what everyone does with friendly rivalries, we would play pranks on one another.</p>
<p>One day I fetched my meal and sat with the other elves, and began to drink my honeyblossum wine, only for a bitter taste to assault my tastebuds. As I gazed around I saw that my elvish companions were all spitting out their drinks in disgust as dwarves laughed on at their devious switcheroo. I detected the pang of alcohol on the palate and realised this wasn't some disgusting concoction designed just to be horrible, it was a strong dwarvish drink they clearly didn't think we had the stomach for. So I steeled my resolve, finished my glass, and gave a huge false sight of satisfaction when done.</p>
<p>Then, just to make my point I drained the glass next to mine too.</p>
<p>The dwarves were both impressed and angry at my resolve, and that's when Jodrolim stepped forward, laughing his head off. He patted me on the back, and announced to the rest of the dwarves.</p>
<p>"We've found mithril in the dirt tonight, lads." He announced, pulling me close and welcoming me into his group of friends. Usually I would have declined out of propriety, but whatever I had drank was of such strength I was willing to throw caution to the wind, and Jodrolim had this relentless charisma that I became completely washed up in.</p>
<p>And after a couple more drinks and Jodrolim's fantastic company, I even felt comfortable letting him take me back to his tent to fuck me.</p>
<p>You have to understand, even in war with everyone seizing the day lest they die tomorrow, I would never usually have sex with someone the first night I met them. I admit I undersell my willingness due to a vestigial attachment to propriety, by his account I swept him off his feet just as surely as he did mine.</p>
<p>From there we went on to spend every moment we could together, any time we weren't training or on manoeuvres we would seek out each other's company. I learned to sharpen my tongue in the presence of his friends, and he learned to refine his wit around mine. That's when I decided to become a member of the yew core. If the men were still advancing, I wanted to face my end side by side with Jodrolim. I already knew the elf assigned to his team was eager to leave and had arranged a swap if my request was approved.</p>
<p>There was bemusement, disappointment, elves trying desperately to talk me out of it, but the only thing I couldn't handle never arrived, rejection.</p>
<p>"Alright fellas." Jodrolim began.</p>
<p>"Fellas?" Yelled a female dwarf in confusion.</p>
<p>"You heard me, Moldir, just coz your privates don't dangle, doesn't make you not one of the fellas. Now shut it while I give my pretty words." Jodrolim replied.</p>
<p>"Pretty words, you've been hanging out with that elf too long." Another of his cohort yelled.</p>
<p>"Well you're about to find out what that's like. I had an awe-inspiring speech about having one of us as a yew core, there was going to be a battle cry and everything, but you ruined it so now I'm just going to say this. Motherfucking Nyana is our battalion's yew core!" Jodrolim announced, rhythmically banging his axe on the ground.</p>
<p>At first there was silence, shock. But soon the whole battalion joined in, banging their axes and cheering with unrestrained joy. I had been quietly standing to one side but the boisterous dwarves wouldn't allow that and lifted me on their shoulders and up to the stage.</p>
<p>"Thanks." I stuttered, not prepared for this outpouring of support. "I don't think an elf has ever gotten this level of support from dwarves."</p>
<p>"It's a low bar, you're just the first one to care if we live or die." Came a yell from the crowd.</p>
<p>"Keep interrupting my speech and see if it stays that way." I joshed. The crowd laughed, appreciating every time I showed that I wasn't stuck up. "None of you actually want to hear me talking, you wanna get drunk and celebrate your slightly increased chances of survival. So get some ale down you, I'll take the battalion's watch duties for you tonight."</p>
<p>The explosion of joy and the party that followed will stay with me for some time as I departed to the defensive embankment at edge of our camp. The fortress we were protecting at the time used outlying dwarf camps as both early warning signals and first line of defence, so constant vigilance was drilled hard and being relieved of watching duty was the highest privilege. I took my place looking out over the plains, no signs of any disturbance except the laughter of Jodrolim's approach about an hour into my shift.</p>
<p>"You certainly know how to raise spirits." He chuckled.</p>
<p>"The lightweights in this battalion can barely handle ale, I don't think they should be moving on to spirits yet." I replied through giggles. "Shouldn't you be joining them?"</p>
<p>"I had a few, but the lads decided you should have some company on watch. I'm telling you, there's a good chance you will be the first elf a dwarf has ever taken an arrow for."</p>
<p>"Do they know I took an arrow from you the night we met? Or did you not want them asking how many tries it took you to hit the bullseye?" I japed.</p>
<p>"Oh, so you're planning on being a brat tonight? Sounds like you need a game of rune bones to put you in your place." Jodrolim suggested, that cheeky glint in his eye sending shivers into my core.</p>
<p>"No." I meekly replied, only encouraging him.</p>
<p>"Oh, that took the blast out of your bellows, didn't realise you..." Jodrolim began.</p>
<p>"One game, real stakes to discourage this attitude of yours. If I win, you have to wear my mage robes at drills tomorrow." I interrupted, playfully goading him.</p>
<p>"Fine, and if I win, you finish your watch shift naked." Jodrolim proposed.</p>
<p>"No way, I know you're a big perv, but what if somebody..."</p>
<p>"Nobody will see you, they're all partying, if I lose they'll all see my forfeit, so I think it's fair." Jodrolim reasoned as he pulled out his set of rune bones, five bone carved dice for the gambler on the go. He always knew he could get a rise out of me, a cheeky grin and a wicked idea and immediately we would become partners in crime. I was looking forward to triumphing.</p>
<p>15 minutes later he had the smuggest grin ever to grace a dwarf.</p>
<p>"Don't think of this as a humiliating defeat, think of it as finding a way to keep your heart beating and your wits sharp while on guard duty." He jibed as I stared at the most lucky rune bone roll to ever grace the game.</p>
<p>"Alright." I sighed as I removed my magic enhancing jewellery and began to undo my robes, "but if I hear anyone coming, I'm putting my clothes back on."</p>
<p>"That wasn't the bet." Jodrolim laughed as he collected up my discarded layers and stared lovingly at me in just my elegant gilded underwear. My pale skin turned red with the full body blush that accompanied my precarious position as I undid my bra and eased out my C-cup breasts. The cold night air and my excitement already combined to make my flower petal pink nipples stand to high attention. I pulled my bloomers down over my battle toned thighs and saw Jodrolim's eyes light up.</p>
<p>"So, like what you see?" I giggled with a sarcastic pose like I was in a regal portrait.</p>
<p>"I don't think a dwarf has ever been so attracted to such a hairless body before," he replied. "How much time does it take you to remove every strand of hair on your body that isn't your luscious golden locks or that small blonde stripe above your pussy?"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't you know, usually us elves are as hairy as you under our robes, but when I saw how many fleas you have living in that ginger forest covering your body, I started shaving myself twice a week to keep the swarm from colonising me." I teased as I turned away to scan the horizon with my telescope.</p>
<p>"Usually I have to work hard to keep up with that quick wit of yours. But tonight I can just do this." Jodrolim chuckled. After a slight pause I felt his hand slap onto my bottom, then give it a tight squeeze.</p>
<p>"Keep that up and you'll have to work hard to keep up with something else of mine." I drooled, turning around so Jodrolim could see the bounty available to him. He took my hint and immediately wrapped his arms around me, pulling my naked body close to him and planting his lips on mine. I wrapped my arms around him and for one moment the heat of our passions chased out even the cold night air.</p>
<p>"Jodrolim, you up there!" A voice floated in above the din of the party.</p>
<p>"Just checking in on our guard, making sure she's not sleeping on the job." Jodrolim yelled back as I dropped into a ball at his feet. "Actually, she's currently doing her guard duty naked up here if you want to climb up and have a look."</p>
<p>Jodrolim struggled to control his laughter as I elbowed him in the shin.</p>
<p>"Very funny, just get down here before all the ale is gone." The voice replied, fading into the din of the party as the sentence petered out.</p>
<p>"You fucking prick, what if he had come up?" I whispered angrily.</p>
<p>"That was Wegguk, he's afraid of even the lowest of heights, would rather eat a barrel of loose bolts than climb up that ladder. We always give him shit for it, so he would have been certain I was joking." Jodrolim explained. "But more importantly, you just called me a fucking prick. Did I just relieve you of that elegant elven tongue?"</p>
<p>"I grant you got the better of me, but you had a major advantage." I pouted as I once again returned to standing up right and exposed in front of the dwarf that stole my heart.</p>
<p>"Well, I feel like I should be claiming my prize then. Let's be quick about it, you cannot be distracted from your guard duties too long and you heard Wegguk, we're running out of ale." Jodrolim riffed as he undid the buckling on his trousers and freed his hard cock. As demurely as I could, I bent over a nearby crate, then felt deeply exposed and violated as Jodrolim gave me a rough fucking right there on the ramparts.</p>
<p>Seeing my love in the heat of battle was as eye-opening as serving within our frontline melee units. We would often be called upon to do skirmishes into nearby forests and marshlands to scout for the enemy camps. Without any sightings these ended up becoming nice, albeit long, walks across wild countryside with my partner. It was a couple of months before we spotted a small unit of men and ended up squaring off for battle.</p>
<p>After the fighting was done, it was clear how much we outclassed this group of enemies. They had no magical support and swords of such low quality that dwarven axes simply cleaved through them. There was much lauding of my assistance spells, many noting the unique situation of coming away from such a fight without sustaining any casualties, but I couldn't help but notice that Jodrolim's fighting style seemed more powerful even than my magic.</p>
<p>As our unit charged into battle, Jodrolim's battle cry was different to the others. While most of the barbarians had eyes that turned red with fury and muscles that bulged with the supernatural rage of battle, Jodrolim's eyes and veins glowed an otherworldly blue. When he swung his axe into the enemy, ghostly wisps rose around him and flowed with each swing. I would later learn that Jodrolim's family line were known as ancestral guardians, beserkers whose deep emotions allowed them to pierce the veil of death and call forward their fallen family to lend them their strength in battle.</p>
<p>"So if we get too into whips and chains in the bedroom, your grandma's going to appear with some choice words for me?" I joked after the battle.</p>
<p>"I mean, it's not necromancy, not like that anyway. There's no intelligence or character of the ancestors that arise, just pure will to protect their family manifesting as battle fury." Jodrolim explained. "So Nanny isn't going to yell at you, but if I get lost in the blue mist, she may lend her strength to my whip arm, her resilience to my paddled bottom, or even clear my mind to think about how I get my revenge."</p>
<p>"Creepy." I instinctively replied.</p>
<p>"If I am feeling such a depth of emotion when we're having sex that I call forward the ancestors, something has either gone drastically wrong or unprecedentedly, earth shatteringly right." Jodrolim informed.</p>
<p>"If ever we know peace, I'll see what I can do." I promised.</p>
<p>When you walk a valley, you do not walk at the very bottom of the cleft, that would leave you susceptible to ambush, and you do not walk at the very top, lest your silhouettes stand out against the sky for miles around. This means that in a land of valleys you get used to walking on a lean, your ankles adapting to the awkward angle as best as they can.</p>
<p>As the tallest and least armoured of the company, I would be slightly downhill from my compatriots, our synchronised height and hiding us better with an understanding that the most likely attacker would come from the higher ground and I would be protected.</p>
<p>Our skirmishes took on a different character since Jodrolim and I stopped hiding our relationship a few months ago and the rest of our company stopped pretending it wasn't obvious. It wasn't like we held hands or anything, we just no longer had to hold back our feelings. If anything this made us better fighters.</p>
<p>"I heard magic users can just look through the eyes of the nearby birds to scan areas like this. Are we schlepping this whole way just cause you two want to make googoo eyes at each other?" a particularly tactless dwarf asked.</p>
<p>"Still your tongue, we're meant to be stealthy." Jodrolim reprimanded, staying professional even though valley had been abandoned the last 14 times we had walked it.</p>
<p>"Yes, I learned the high level difficult magic necessary to command the senses of animals, but your mother asked me to take you out on patrol, hoping that if you're worn out you'll stop fucking all the goats in your homestead." I replied, not letting Jodrolim's silent pleas for quiet blunt my tongue.</p>
<p>"Just because it wasn't..."</p>
<p>That's all I remember hearing.</p>
<p>The nearest man encampment was over a mile away, nobody expected them to tunnel so far, let alone break cover for a single company patroling the edges of our land. They broke up through the ground, their aim to have us cut down before I could cast any protective spells or my comrades could marshall their rage.</p>
<p>It was effective.</p>
<p>The ground ran red with blood, our blood. The blood of the slain had become our stock and trade, who'd have thought the same substance could be changed in my mind so much by where it had once dwelled.</p>
<p>I had been prepared for facing my end alongside my lover. In my naivety I had assumed we would die together, side by side facing the end. I never could have fathomed that I would arise from my daze, channel my inspiration and magical assistance into the ragtag dwarves that had somehow risen above the ambush to fight by my side, and notice that Jodrolim was not among them.</p>
<p>I'm retrospect, in my anger, I was not helpful to my other comrades. I remember freezing men alive, their screams shattering with their bodies giving my rage only momentary satisfaction, like quenching a fire with acid. I offered my unit very little in the way of protection and they suffered heavily for it. When I knelt among the dead, the last survivor, my voice could only whimper the sole thought that had been in my mind since our deaths rose from the ground.</p>
<p>"Jodrolim?"</p>
<p>"Nyana?" A wispy voice cut through the horrific silence. I followed it to where the love of my life lay slain. Please let me assure you that when I say slain, I don't mean clinging onto life, I mean that no natural life remained within him. His injuries were obvious and severe, and yet through his indomitable will and supernatural means beyond my understanding, he was still talking to me.</p>
<p>"Fuck me!" I exclaimed without a filter, simply reacting to the sight in front of me.</p>
<p>"Probably don't have the time for that." He replied, not allowing even death to take away his wit. "I'm only still present because I need to say one last thing..."</p>
<p>"I pledge an oath to you, and with this oath we are kin." his whisper roared around me. Then the glowing blue wisps of my love evaporated from his destroyed body.</p>
<p>I wanted to scream and wail until the end of days, I wanted to take whatever scraps of my lover's body remained and hold them so tight they became one with me. But before I could, out of the ground arose the most contemptible creature I have ever encountered.</p>
<p>To rise out of the ground, defeat your enemy by ambush is already a gutless way to fight a war. But how much of a coward must a disgraced soul be to, while their friends are attacking and dying in such an amoral way, hang back and wait to emerge only when the situation is advantageous to you?</p>
<p>"To the victor goes the spoils." This disgusting man drooled, looking over me with his sword in hand. My rage became so uncontained that I found the world still and calm, like a brief silent moment of a landslide before the rocks crash into the ground. I wrapped my hand around Jodrolim's axe, it felt both right and light, like another hand was within mine, grasping it together. I somehow found comfort in my rage, a blue wisp of Jodrolim swirled around me and steadied my breath, through our combined rage there was unerring righteousness in my strike.</p>
<p>I have always been a spell weaver, I fight with my brain and spirit, I didn't even join the dwarves in their physical drills when I became a yew core. I was as unfamiliar to the axe as a chef is to mining equipment. Yet with this surge of rage I swung the axe and it severed everything in its path: the man's sword, the man's arm, the man's torso, and the droplets of blood that hung in the air for the instantaneous moment before he could react and realise his life was over.</p>
<p>As he fell, I wanted to take the axe and hack away at him. I wanted nothing left of this wretch but chunks too small to dissect. But the moment he fell, I felt Jodrolim's presence leave me. With him by my side I performed a cleave that could be written into legends, without him I didn't even have the strength to lift the axe.</p>
<p>I simply collapsed and cried into the ever increasing pool of blood.</p>
<p>1 year later</p>
<p>"Do you know how fucking useless medals of valour are?" I slurred as the innkeeper indulged me. "I lost everything in a single day, but don't worry, I have a slab of metal that says I was a big brave girl."</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>The innkeeper was not ready for me, they never are. It turns out the battle in the valley was against an advanced recon party in a strategically vulnerable area. Had any of them returned, the whole of mankind's armies would have been marching down that unfortified route and it would have been bad news for a vital military position. So now I was a hero of some kind, I was also so traumatised that I could not be deployed in the field again. Instead I was given a medal, a series of monotonous speeches about the indomitable spirit of elves, and a post as an ambassador. I spend my days travelling with great fanfare to labouriously convince small-time Dwarven politicians that elves aren't so bad, and whenever I have room in my schedule and am in a town with an inn, I will spend my nights diving deep into delirium.</p>
<p>"Would you like some company tonight?" A young dwarf asked, sitting down next to me.</p>
<p>"Subtle." I bluntly noted. "Alright hot shot, how much for a fuck?"</p>
<p>"One gold piece." He replied, a little putout that I wasn't playing his sophisticated word games, he was about to be even more disappointed.</p>
<p>"Alright stud, here's 2 gold pieces, one to get fucked, and another to go fuck yourself." I slurred sliding the coins across the table. The dwarf was conflicted, taking 1 gold coin to give me a ride would have been fine but 2 to endure an insult seemed somehow worse. It didn't stop him from disappearing without a word though.</p>
<p>"If you don't want to be bothered by sex workers, I wouldn't recommend paying them to leave you alone." The innkeeper advised. "Word gets out you're paying them to go away, we'll have swarms of them looking to cash in without lifting a finger."</p>
<p>"Next one to bother me gets a chill touch on a finger they'll want to lift in the future." I sneered. The inkeeper gave me a polite chuckle and poured another drink. "So anyway, I tried to sell the medal, turns out that's illegal, tried to melt it down and sell the precious metals it's made of, it's enchanted and reinforced just enough to hugely drive up the cost of melting it down to make sure it exceeds the value of what you would salvage. These fuckers know how few people want to be reminded of this shit and still they give us a physical thing we can't get rid of just to keep it fresh in our minds. How fucked up is that?"</p>
<p>"Could just chuck it." the innkeeper suggested.</p>
<p>"Any scavenger who can detect magic ends up spotting it from a mile away, it's got my name on it and an ongoing promise of a reward for its return. The third time I paid out to some trash digging fuck, I just stopped trying down that route." I ranted. "Nah, I've made peace that this shitty thing will stare into the hole in me until my dying day."</p>
<p>"Doesn't sound like you have." The innkeeper muttered.</p>
<p>We locked eyes, fear creeped over his face as he realised that he hadn't muttered his quip as quietly as first thought. Then I got to see his fear turn to confusion as a bitter laugh escaped my mouth.</p>
<p>"That was fucking funny. Nobody talks to me like that anymore." I acknowledged between guffaws. "Nobody calls me on my bullshit, I miss that."</p>
<p>"Hey hot stuff, how would you..." another sex worker began, interrupting my point to help me illustrate it.</p>
<p>"That other guy lied to you, I'm not giving out money, he just wants to ruin my night by making sure I'm not left alone. All because I told him to go fuck himself." I explained, sending them off in a huff. "How many prostitutes usually hang out here?"</p>
<p>"Usually just the one, but you'd be amazed how many more crawl out of the woodwork when an opportunity presents itself." The innkeeper explained.</p>
<p>"War and sex." I slurred, my last memories of the night thinking that was some form of deep insight.</p>
<p>That morning I awoke to a loud banging, metal fists on a wooden door. I peeled apart my eyes and realised I was in an unfamiliar room, lying on an unfamiliar bed, watching a familiar innkeeper quickly throw on a robe before signalling for me to not make a sound as he peeled the door ajar.</p>
<p>"What in blazes is the big problem?" He grunted at the men.</p>
<p>"We are the personal guard of the illustrious Ambassador Nyana Springdew. She was last seen at your establishment last night." A stern voice replied, shaking me out of my stupor.</p>
<p>This time it was me signalling the innkeeper to shut the hell up. I could feel his blankets on my naked body, but I didn't actually process that I was naked until I lifted my coverings and confirmed it with my own eyes.</p>
<p>"There was a well appointed elf drinking in my bar last night, is she not in the room I rented her?" The innkeeper covered with startling confidence as I got out of his bed and started desperately searching his room for my clothes.</p>
<p>"Her door was locked, but more disturbingly some of her clothes were discovered downstairs by the bar." The upright guard explained.</p>
<p>"Shit." I quietly swore to myself, learning that I must have stripped early in the throes of passion. This turned out to be a big mistake.</p>
<p>"Is somebody else in there?" The guard barked. I knew this guy, I knew what a stubborn git he could be, I had ten seconds before he barged down the door and this innkeeper gets accused of all matters of sordid crimes to preserve my reverence. In my panicked hangover, my brain could only process one incredibly stupid course or action.</p>
<p>I jumped out of the window.</p>
<p>My first bit of luck was that the innkeeper's room was on the ground floor so I didn't fall far. My second bit of luck was that the innkeeper's room was at the back of the inn and my guards were either waiting around the front or barging down the innkeeper's door. My third and final piece of luck was that the back door to the inn was open and I had a way back inside. However it should be noted that the world seemed to conspire that every piece of good luck was balanced out by a piece of bad luck.</p>
<p>The ground floor room meant that I had to stay on my hands and knees, keeping myself below the window line lest my overzealous guards spot me in the garden. There were no guards in the back garden of the inn, but there was a small crowd of dwarven craftsmen having breakfast and ale before heading to work. The back door was indeed open, but it led straight to the bar where a small rumble of noise assured me more would be inside.</p>
<p>I began crawling as fast as my arms, knees, and hangover would allow, wordlessly pleading to my bemused audience to not make my presence known to the guards who were bursting into the room I just burst out of. They remained quiet but did not stop staring at my exposure.</p>
<p>"Citizens, please return to your breakfast, nothing to see here." My pompous guard announced, assuming the assembled dwarves were staring at him through the window.</p>
<p>"Hard disagree." One dwarf yelled, the gathered falling into laughter with him.</p>
<p>I stood up next to the window, mouthed a brief thank you to the crowd that had not given me up, then sprinted inside.</p>
<p>The bar was not crowded, but it was far from empty and a naked elf barging into the room did not go unnoticed. I gritted my teeth and began the awkward process of barging my way past the various onlookers to get to the stairs that lead to my room.</p>
<p>I felt like I was home free when I suddenly felt a stout hand grasp my arm, turning my momentum back upon me and pulling me towards a group of 4 dwarfs.</p>
<p>"Hey there pretty, I see you're all ready to provide us with some morning entertainment." He maliciously sneered. Suddenly I felt a wave of fear, not on my behalf but on his. I had created a commotion, the guards would be heading this way shortly, and if they arrived to see me stripped naked and in the clutches of this dwarf, his head would be on its third bounce by the time I got a single word out in his defence. I tried to squirm myself free but he grasped me tighter, this stupid lustful idiot didn't realise his dick was signing his death warrant.</p>
<p>My heart was pounding, my hangover forgotten to the driving adrenaline of my predicament, I felt my deepest fears mix with my resolve, somehow even finding fury at myself for causing this situation. Then as I pulled my arm away from his, it felt easy, assisted by a presence that felt, I don't know, comfortable. Not comfortable like a warm fire, but comfortable like a sword grip that perfectly fits your hand. My heart beat no less fast, my fear and anger no less acute, yet as that blue spirit glowed around and within me, I felt like a long lost piece of me had returned.</p>
<p>The dwarf who had grabbed me fell backwards hard, his friends backed away from me, and my fury turned to exhilaration as I climbed the stairs faster than I would usually be able to fall down them. I took a deep breath at the precipice of my door, my mind clasping for the password I had set up to the magical lock when I first checked in.</p>
<p>"Sanctuary" I whispered, and as I did I felt the blue mist lifting and Jodrolim's will returning to the beyond. I stepped into my room, I would have loved to simply sit there and cry, but that would be unfair to the innkeeper currently having his room turned over by my overzealous guards. I threw on a sleeping robe and immediately made my way to his room.</p>
<p>"Commander Stillstar, desist and explain yourself immediately!" I boomed with as much authority as I could muster.</p>
<p>"Madam Ambassador, when you did not show at this morning's meeting, we worried that you had been kidnapped or somehow attacked. Then I heard a suspicious noise in this room and..." the commander rambled until I cut him off.</p>
<p>"Commander Stillstar. Your objections to my unaccompanied visits to meet the citizens of the places we visit are well recorded. But this is a grievous overreaction. This kind dwarf gave me shelter, made me his guest, and this is how he is repaid?"</p>
<p>"I understand your view that you learn more about a ruler from their subjects than their lodgings, but surely you could return to the rooms set aside for you at the end of the night to prevent these misunderstandings." The commander pleaded.</p>
<p>"The way we prevent these misunderstandings is to trust that I am skilled at my job and a former soldier. Any other soldier in your garrison would not be assumed kidnapped if they overslept as I had." I explained.</p>
<p>"But we found your clothes in the bar area." the commander squeaked.</p>
<p>"An enterprising armourer wanted to examine elven stitching techniques to see if they could have wider applications to his work, so I brought him one of my changes of clothes and must have left them behind the bar. In exchange for this act of charity, I now know the exact armour the local militias use, and the production and procurement process by which they obtain them." Even I was impressed by the subterfuge my brain rattled together on the fly. "Now you are to apologise to this kind dwarf, then take your guards and wait outside while I arrange adequate compensation for your buffoonery."</p>
<p>The elven warrior signalled his cohort to move over before slinking from my sight and out the front door. I gave the innkeeper a pouch of coins and a sweet kiss on the cheek before packing my things and checking out.</p>
<p>I could not care less about the petty problems of a regional magistrate of minimal importance. I was simply sent to smile and discuss what joys the elves could layer on our wartime alliance if some of the regional vassals were more enthusiastic and stopped threatening to overthrow dwarven aristocrats every time they let an elf even look at dwarven crafts. This dwarf was fixated on what would happen to elvish refugees if the men broke through our northern borders, mincing his words carefully to not offend me, while also implying my entire race would be arriving to drain the meagre resources of his town the moment the first man stepped foot in the forests that surrounded our most far flung settlements.</p>
<p>As I reassured him that our alliance was strong and holding back the invading menace, all my mind could focus on was that long lost feeling of wholeness recaptured this morning. I knew, through his deathbed oath, that Jodrolim had bound his spirit to me, I had become a barbarian on the path of the ancestral guardian despite barely being able to lift an axe. In the past I had tried meditation to lure me into the depth of feeling required to conjure him, but that was a very elvish solution to a dwarven problem. Next I tried going back to battle, hoping that I could spend the rest of my days fighting by his side, but at the first drop of blood I was right back in that valley, only despair flowing through me. I had given up on directly feeling his spirit again until this morning.</p>
<p>"... prosperous turnip harvest could be sent to the front if it has not been requisitioned to the unworthy." The old dwarf continued as I drifted back to the conversation, unwilling to tell him that even the most down on their luck elf would rather eat the grass of the fields than choke down a turnip prepared in the traditional dwarvish fashion.</p>
<p>"My good magistrate. I am indeed thankful to have visited. Last night, as I spoke to your citizens, it became clear they felt well represented by your endeavours. Now that I meet you I can see why. You need not fear that we have come to ask for charity, nor have we come to assess your capacity to act as our stewards, we have instead come to establish the framework of reciprocity through which we can both flourish." I abounded, knowing that running through a script I had given a hundred times before was at least better than listening to this gasbag ramble on with more conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>"Don't think you can bamboozle me with fancy words. I'm not going to go soft just to pretend I have the same book learning as some ivory tower elf." The magistrate interrupted.</p>
<p>"Alright then, plain words. Even though I adore dwarven ale, most of my kind would sooner drink puddle water. Conversely if I brought a barrel of Honeyblossom wine, I suspect you would sooner clean your carts with it than let it go down your throat." I explained. "Elves aren't looking to nick your stuff, we're looking to take stuff off your hands that you don't want, and trade it for stuff we don't want.</p>
<p>"We haven't got any honeyblossom wine to trade." The obstinate dwarf chuckled.</p>
<p>"But I'm sure you have gold, as you know gold is a soft, malleable metal, not suitable for armour and weapons, every bellows in the town has a bin full of the stuff. Just like how we have been discarding mithril because it is too rigid to use in intricate crafts. We are so different that if we work together, we're not going to be stepping on each other's toes." I explained, which seemed to strike a chord with the magistrate.</p>
<p>"Those are some good ideas, but I've never trusted an elf on words alone, you guys are too practised at them." He muttered, before having an idea and turning to a nearby servant. "Bring us some ale, let's see if this ambassador was on the level when she said she liked it."</p>
<p>"Now that's a deal I can get behind. Drinking my way into your good graces, I wouldn't have it any other way." I cheered. "You wouldn't happen to know Bite The Beast Right Back?"</p>
<p>"Why did we waste all this time talking when we could have been drinking and singing dwarven drinking songs? Yes I know Bite the Beast Right Back, and before the end of tonight all for miles around will hear it." The magistrate announced as flagons of ale arrived at our table and my guard rolled their eyes. Raucous singing and plentiful alcohol would silence my mind better than high stakes diplomacy, and would keep me happy until I was out of this stupid town and somewhere I could think about how to reconnect with Jodrolim.</p>
<p>I had never been in a hurry to get to the next town before. Usually when the embassy packed up and took to the roads, I was happy to be travelling across the wilds. It was calm, meditative, I could sit and look out of the cart window, or if I felt restless I could get out and march with the soldiers to relive old times. (This was one more piece of evidence for the more polite elves to label me eclectic and for the less polite elves to label me an unhinged mad woman).</p>
<p>This journey was different though, the next town on our itinerary was called Thrommtin, onomatopoeically named for the sounds of ore refining forges and pickaxes on rock. The town was a mine with some living arrangements plopped in as an afterthought. Part of my remit in visiting Thrommtin was the grisly business of securing the release of elven prisoners enslaved within the mines, the legacy of a wars between dwarves and elves now forgotten to mankind's aggression.</p>
<p>I was no hero, only a diplomat, so I was to continue to press with the promises made by my superiors, the assurance that through our alliance, the freed elves could be replaced with men captured in our current war. It was trading one being's misery for another's, but it wasn't within my remit to do any significant change so I just had to roll with it.</p>
<p>What occupied my mind though was my impressions of other mining towns that had relied on slavery. At night the slaves returned to their lodgings, their overseers returned to some form of guard regimen, and the other amenities of the town would often be sparsely populated. Were this the case with Thrommtin, and if I spotted an opportunity, I had resolved to get drunk and traverse at least one small corner of the town naked in hopes of feeling Jodrolim's presence once again.</p>
<p>The magistrate met me at the city gates, the notes from previous embassies told me he was a very personable dwarf called Bhador, whose charisma belied the depths of cruelty he was capable of.</p>
<p>"Ambassador Springdew, you come with high praise from the most miserable bastards ever to claw themselves up to magistrate. I am honoured that I am next on your itinerary." He boomed, clearly hoping to throw me off my game with some uncomfortable honesty, I felt he could stand to sample some in return.</p>
<p>"Magistrate Bhador, thank you for the welcome, as you are clearly not miserable, I look forward to finding out what kind of bastard you are." I boisterously replied. There was a tense silence from both our military accompaniments before we both began laughing in unison.</p>
<p>"Even if I had not read up on you, I would know just from this first impression that you have spent time around real dwarves, not as some snotty observer but as equals. I mean, look how uncomfortable your guards are with your tone." He stammered out around tears of laughter as we firmly shook hands.</p>
<p>"Magistrate, thank you for meeting us at the gate, I am aware that we made faster progress than you were expecting and would not wish to intrude on your hospitality unprepared." I began.</p>
<p>"No need to make your excuses, the messenger hawks warned me you would look for an excuse to visit a proper public house while you were here. Alas we do not have an inn, just a simple tavern, so instead I have made available to you my guest house that you can return to after your night of revelry, while your military guard can garrison with my soldiers." Bhador explained.</p>
<p>"You seem on the level, but I hope you don't mind me stating a few terms just to be safe. Were you to visit an elven city and find them this prepared for you I can imagine you would also be wary." I replied.</p>
<p>"Fair enough, I always have time to engage a pragmatist." Bhador agreed.</p>
<p>"Firstly, my guards will not garrison with yours, I would worry to place them in the middle of another army's encampment where they are outnumbered at least 10 to 1. If you were to decide to attack them by ambush, it would stain their uniforms to kill that many." I joked to take the sting out of the accusation that Bhador would slaughter us all given the opportunity to do so without consequence. "For everyone's peace of mind they will make camp outside the city limits where ambush would be impossible without my soldiers having time to send messenger hawks reporting your attack."</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"That's fine, less mess for us to clean up afterwards." Bhador replied.</p>
<p>"Next, as my guards are outside the town limits with the ability to contact my superiors, I am confident that no harm will befall me within the town. So any thoughts you may be having of providing me with an escort, entourage, or any other word you can find for babysitter, need no longer plague your mind. Simply allow me to magically scan and seal the house you have provided and then your need to oversee me is over for the night." I explained.</p>
<p>"Thrommtin can be dangerous at night..." Bhador began to protest.</p>
<p>"So can I." I firmly replied, putting an end to the matter.</p>
<p>"Alright then." Bhador agreed, "Well, as I seem to have been relieved of a lot of my hosting duties tonight, I will show you to your house, and then retire to the town hall, awaiting a marvellous day of discussion tomorrow."</p>
<p>Bhador and his retinue turned to leave, Commander Stillstar gave me a look that told me he did not approve, but then ordered his troops away to a defensible location outside the town limits, where he certainly would not be a witness of what was to come. I picked up my chest of clothes and carried it all the way to the allocated house, despite the chivalrous pleas from Bhador's troops to take it for me.</p>
<p>I had never known a tavern to close simply because the barkeep got tired and decided it was time for him to go to bed. In fairness the tavern was dead. There were a few slavers passing through town and a couple of the overseers who still had enough attachment to empathy to want to drink away the echoes of screams that rattled around their mind after a day of subjugation. They drank hard and quick, not much for conversation, then once they had departed I was left for an hour talking to a bartender who said precisely three words to me and it felt like that was three times more than usual.</p>
<p>Thrommtin was a very functional town. The only house I saw was the one I had been allocated in the vicinity of the large town hall building where Bhador lived and official business was done. Everyone else simply had living arrangements bolted on to their vocation. I had scanned the streets on my walk to the tavern and I saw blacksmiths, armourers, leatherworkers, and even chefs, all closing up their business for the day to retreat to the bed in the back room. Now I stood alone on empty streets with my deviant plan in mind.</p>
<p>Next door to the tavern was a smelter who would make large metal parts for the various machinations and devices that surrounded mining. I had made a point to talk to him before heading into the tavern and as I hoped, his forge was large and needed to generate incredible heat. Not only did this mean that it never had enough time to cool and completely go out, but also that it was away from his house for safety reasons.</p>
<p>I opened a small hatch on the side and saw the swirling orange inferno as a waft of heat escaped. I had taken off my jewellery in preparation for my plan, but considering the intensity of the red hot coals, I was certain that I probably could have followed through even if I had brought them. I steeled my resolve and repeated my plan to myself in my head.</p>
<p>'You are going to take off your clothes, put them in the forge, and then you will be forced to walk across town and back to your house naked.'</p>
<p>I thought things through for a second, but decided I should probably double check I was definitely alone before I went through with my plan. I glanced around the area, it all seemed calm and quiet, but just to be on the safe side I casted detect magic and had a look around.</p>
<p>Dwarves are not regular magic users, at least not in this part of the world, so a single magical artefact in the void of magic that was my surroundings stood out like someone trying to hide a lit firework under their shirt. I looked over to the source and saw a well camouflaged dwarf, crouched in an alleyway with a small magical bronze spyglass held to his eye.</p>
<p>He barely had time to react as I rushed over to him, knocking him over. Before he could get up I reached down his trousers, grabbed his balls and squeezed them, taking charge of the situation. I then channelled my magic into a freezing touch in my hand, rapidly cooling his testicles until he mewed with pain.</p>
<p>"I know your mind is probably occupied with the wellbeing of your balls, so let's keep things to simple yes or no questions shall we? I'm guessing Bhador sent you to spy on me. Did he just send you?"</p>
<p>The dwarf nodded.</p>
<p>"If you were to leave now and report back to him that I got blackout drunk then staggered back to the house without incident, do you think he would believe you?" I asked.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"Brilliant. For what it's worth I just wanted to have a look around. There won't be any theft, sabotage or evidence I was unguarded. It will not cause you any problems to go home right now. However, if I see you again on my travels, I will enjoy feeling your frozen balls shatter in my hand, do I make myself clear?"</p>
<p>He nodded and ran.</p>
<p>I figured if he had sent more than one spy, this one would have been less cooperative and certainly wouldn't have been as eager to leave. After all, he would have known he was being watched. Any wavering confidence issues I had with my plan were firmly obliterated by the wave of self-esteem I gained feeling I handled that situation well.</p>
<p>I gave the spy enough time to get far away before walking back to the forge feeling powerful. I removed my dress and my underclothes, chosen for their age and my lack of attachment, and with little hesitation I threw them into the forge. My eyes bulged with the rush of adrenaline watching everything I had on me go up in flames. I took a deep breath in to centre myself within this experience, then closed the forge hatch and turned around to face the empty streets.</p>
<p>Turning from glowing orange heat to dark blue cold night was like stepping from one world to another. Suddenly I felt far weaker and exposed, the weather had been the least of my worries and suddenly a gust of wind whipped down the road and I shivered with cold exposure.</p>
<p>I started by dropping low and pinning myself against a wall to sneak along. I gave myself comfort in my strategies, diving between alleyways, keeping to the shadows of night, confident that I would not be caught if I played this situation smart.</p>
<p>I ducked behind some barrels and slipped, falling onto the ground, my muscles giving into my humiliation leaving my body sprawled on the ground.</p>
<p>In the still dark night I felt so alone.</p>
<p>I got myself up, dusted myself off, and wondered to myself what I needed to do to really put myself out there. I needed to feel the swirl of fear and fury I felt at the inn at the last town if I wanted to feel Jodrolim's will with me again. First things first, I stepped away from the building, no more alleyways and sneaking, I was going to walk down the middle of the road and accept the consequences.</p>
<p>My skin prickled and stomach gurgled as I stepped out into the road. I gripped my bottom hard in my hands, indulging my nerves and living in the horrifying moment. As I walked down the road, there was a rustle that came from somewhere nearby and I felt my emotions begin to bubble up. I rapidly turned on my heels, squinting into the night to try and see the source of the rustling, both relieved and disappointed that there seemed to be nothing to it.</p>
<p>I turned a corner and felt a wave of disappointment that the guest house loomed ahead of me, the town was too damn quiet, that prick Bhador had said it was dangerous but I had simply walked the streets naked and gotten away with it. I needed something to furiously regret, I couldn't just make a rule and follow it, because I felt no fear in an agreement with myself, no rage at putting myself in the situation. The closest I got to what I was aiming for was that moment I first put my clothes in the forge, but because I was feeling so buoyed by dealing with that spy, I didn't get close to the blue mist as I should have. I needed to do something I would not only regret, but be unable to take back.</p>
<p>I turned away from my house and began walking deeper into the town, I couldn't think of something reckless to do right now, but the way I saw it I would find something if I kept looking. Worst case scenario, I would wander the streets until morning and get discovered by the citizens as they awoke.</p>
<p>A mania started to grasp my mind as I walked the streets naked, each shop or building would compete to plant the strangest idea in my mind. I saw a blacksmith with a range of ornate swords and axes, and wondered if I should wake him up and offer to trade my body for one. Then I saw some stables and my mind reeled with thoughts of tying myself alongside the horses. As I ventured further into the town I began to get closer and closer to the mine, I wondered if I could display myself to the slaves, or worse pretend to be a fleeing slave in need of recapturing and correction.</p>
<p>One shop closer to the pit caught my eye and my mind like no other though, it was a metalworks that created shackles and restraints in humanoid proportions, depressingly at home in a town such as this. I saw the greatest array of bad ideas spread out around the workspace and my mind knew it had hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>Using magic to undo locks was the only spell I had learned since my days in the military, it was considered a useful skill for an ambassador to have if they decided that they needed to be a bit underhanded in their mission. To replicate the effect of a key had the unfortunate side effect of creating a loud knocking noise, but using a shrink spell to reduce the size of the deadbolt so it no longer held the door shut was just as effective and quieter. Even with all the owner's expertise in locks, this door was no match for me and soon I was in his establishment looking at the various devices and tools of restraint. The mania that had taken hold of my mind twisted my motivations so the worse a device was, the more I needed to fasten it onto me.</p>
<p>At the back of the shop, on a decorative pillow was a metal collar that confused and intrigued me. Everything else was a mess of chains and awkwardly shaped metal to enact some cruel desire on the poor victim, yet this simple collar seemed to be the pride and joy of this sadistic display, with an obscene price tag to match. I cast detect magic and saw that the collar was saturated with magic in a variety of schools. Clearly this was an enchanted collar, and although I couldn't tell what the enchantments did, I knew that the moment that collar clicked around my neck, they would be activated. This was the mistake I had been searching to make.</p>
<p>I snatched the collar and immediately snapped it around my neck, as it closed I heard the telltale sound of thrumming magic and immediately changed my mind, clawing at where the opening was and only finding smooth metal. I ran out of the door to the shop, into the street. Suddenly I felt my arms pulled behind me by some supernatural force, pinning my wrists together behind my back. I tried to keep running but suddenly my legs felt like they were moving through treacle and could only slowly step forward at a measured pace.</p>
<p>I tried to cast a spell, reversing the spell I used for lockpicking to hopefully enlarge the collar so I could slip it off my head. As I tried I realised that not only were my hands unable to move in such a way to cast the spell, but when I tried to speak the words out loud, I suddenly felt my tongue pulled downwards to dangle out of my mouth, as if attached to a heavy weight.</p>
<p>I had never felt such anger at myself, from childhood elves were always taught to never wear garments you find or are given before someone with detect magic has a chance to look at them. Now, as an adult, my raging lebido had placed an enchanted collar on my neck knowing it would create an ordeal for me. I slowly walked the streets of Thrommtin waiting for my destruction at my own hands, wishing I could just feel some satisfaction before my downfall.</p>
<p>At first I thought the tingling feeling in my body was yet another effect of the collar, but the blue mist that surrounded me and the overwhelming comfort at Jodrolim's presence confirmed that my self-destructive mission had been a success. I strained against my magical bonds with a newfound strength, augmented from the beyond, and still my arms would not budge.</p>
<p>'Why did I think Jodrolim would help with this?' I thought to myself 'I need to think my way out of the device, not use brute force'</p>
<p>I tried to think of a solution but my mind was still so clouded by raw emotion I didn't even know where to begin. That's when I felt a new tingle from Jodrolim, my pussy began to stimulate itself while my hands were still wedged behind my back. All the fear and rage cleared out in my brain as I felt a powerful wave of eroticism at my lover's will turned to my violation. I collapsed in the street, my contorted mouth groaning with a powerful orgasm. When I reopened my eyes, my mind was clear and my lover was gone.</p>
<p>'Fuck.' I thought to myself as I collected myself and got to my feet. 'How do I dispel this collar?'</p>
<p>With my mind now clear, I was able to think through all the angles and figure out the nearest source of dispellment, however I had to control my fury at the inevitable conclusion.</p>
<p>'Commander Stillstar, all military commanders are taught basic dispelling for eliminating enemy weapons and traps.' I thought to myself, dreading the long walk to the camp and the look on the commander's face when I turned up like this. A small rivulet of drool dripped from my outstretched tongue to the ground as I put one foot in front of the other and started my journey.</p>
<p>I had been surely walking an hour by the time I was able to retract my steps to the edge of the town. By then I had left a trail of drool down my body and behind me. I saw the gates I had first arrived at and felt relief my journey was soon to be over.</p>
<p>"Halt! Who goes there?" A voice yelled from the top of the barricades surrounding the gate. I wanted to run or hide, but for some reason I suddenly felt compelled to stop and not move a muscle while a dwarf climbed down a ladder to get real close and examine me. This was it, this guard had me at his mercy, I was going to feel my downfall tonight.</p>
<p>"Explain." The dwarven warrior barked, all of a sudden another wave of compliance washed over me, the collar even released its hold on my tongue to allow me to obey.</p>
<p>"I am ambassador Nyana Springdew of the elven federation." I began, horrified that my first port of call was to identify myself. I felt weak and angry and suddenly I once again felt Jodrolim's presence by my side at my lowest moment. I was being compelled to explain myself, but with Jodrolim's will at my side I felt confident that I could salvage some reputation through using only partial truths. "I investigated this collar out of curiosity of what your slaves go through and ended up falling victim to the foul magic within it. I was seeking passage to my military unit to have it dispelled discreetly and prevent a diplomatic incident, but now I find myself at your mercy."</p>
<p>The moment I finished talking, the magic of the collar once again pulled my tongue clear of my mouth to present myself to my captors.</p>
<p>"Fucking hell!" A second, less professional dwarf yelled upon seeing who his colleague was talking to.</p>
<p>"Calm down Frutnub, this situation requires some tact." My questioner replied. While this did still the dwarf's tongue, it didn't stop him from rushing to his colleague's side to get a closer look at my disgraced state. "Remember how, in your training, we tell you not to even touch unexplained items or garments until someone with magic detection has cleared it? This is why."</p>
<p>I instinctively stared at my feet in shame, but seeing my naked body forced me back into the moment and the blue mist of Jodrolim grew stronger.</p>
<p>"So what are we going to do? Is she a new slave for us now?" Frutnub drooled with enthusiasm, my insides boiled at the thought.</p>
<p>"She says she's the ambassador that arrived yesterday, that's a delicate situation that you better believe is above our paygrade to make decisions about. I say we take her to Magistrate Bhador and let him figure out what happens next." The other dwarf explained. I didn't know if being taken to Bhador was worse or better than anonymously disappearing into slavery but neither seemed appealing.</p>
<p>"Alright then, and I guess you'll be the one taking her?" Frutnub pouted.</p>
<p>"If I trusted you even a little to deal with this situation professionally, I would let you have at it. But until then, get one last good look to remember when you are in your bunk and then go back to your post." the dwarf told Frutnub, and without any sense of propriety or self respect, he did indeed walk a circle around me, taking in every exposed millimetre of my flesh. "Alright, you're coming with me."</p>
<p>The older dwarf walked a few steps ahead of me while I stayed rooted to the spot. He rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>"One last chance before this gets ugly." The guard growled. "Follow."</p>
<p>Another wave of complicity flowed over my body and I began to walk lock step behind the guard. With Jodrolim's comfort I thought through what had occurred and figured out what spell was in play. Alongside everything else, this collar had been enchanted with the command spell, every time I had been given a one word command I had been forced to obey it, this was why I now had no choice but to follow.</p>
<p>The sun was beginning to rise, a sliver of orange lined the horizon and fought through the night to begin to light my world. The streets were not yet at their usual daytime bustle, but there were some early rising eyeballs on my situation. But worse still for my rising fear, the looming town hall getting larger and larger as we approached.</p>
<p>We approached the grand double doors and two dwarven guards snapped to attention, before losing all composure to marvel at me.</p>
<p>"Wake the magistrate and tell him we have a situation with the elven ambassador, I will await him in his office." My professional escort relayed to his colleagues. It took them a moment to pick their jaws up off the floor and open the door so I could be lead inside and word could be sent to Bhador.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath, drinking in the mess of emotions that had been my night, embracing them as I had embraced Jodrolim. I needed to gather strength for what lay ahead and Jodrolim's blue mist swirled around me to stay by my side for the task.</p>
<p>Bhador walked in and I stared him straight in the eye, were my tongue freed I would ensure I got the first words in but instead I simply panted like an out of breath dog.</p>
<p>"When my little guarantee of your safety returned suspiciously early with sparce information, I assumed you had shaken him and wondered how much trouble you could get up to, but this is a whole new level." He monologued as he circled me like a vulture over an already defeated deer. "What happened?"</p>
<p>I tried to explain my predicament as I had done with the guard, but absent a one word command my tongue was not released and I simply embarrassed myself with garbled and gagged words.</p>
<p>"Well that's just embarrassing, but it does give me an idea as to what happened. You didn't happen to, on your late night unsupervised walk, find yourself within a metalwork shop specialising in shackles, south west of the slave quarters?" he asked. I nodded and this brought him a lot of joy. He ordered the guard to leave and closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>"I knew it, ever since you elf cunts started sending ambassadors, all you've been able to talk about is freeing the elf slaves. You were investigating Grunkle's wares to figure out how to spring them without my permission weren't you."</p>
<p>I vigorously shook my head but this did nothing to placate him as he slapped me across the face. His blow was rough but with Jodrolim's constitution I was able to take it without much fuss.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"Well clearly at some point you touched that collar and now you are helpless. Do you know what now sits on your neck? Because I do, Grunkle told me all about it when he tried to drain my treasury to produce more, the restraints, the commands, he never mentioned that it stripped its captive naked, that's just a bonus." He gushed. Before turning to me and looking me dead in the eye to assert his dominance as he gave me an order.</p>
<p>"Bark!"</p>
<p>Immediately my tongue loosened, only to be put to work barking like a dog for Bhador's extreme amusement.</p>
<p>"Alright, if I remember that elf Grunkle worked with explaining his spells, the restraints stay on indefinitely, as does the motion slowing, I get 10 command spells a day, I also get 2..." he trailed off, realising another function of the collar he had previously forgotten. He rummaged around his desk for some paper that was clearly some form of instructions and when he found it he giggled with glee.</p>
<p>He studied the collar around my neck, then when he spotted what he was looking for, I felt his finger press against a specific place on the collar. After a small pause, a wavy sphere of yellow energy emanated from my neck and engulfed my body. As it did so, I felt my tongue once again become released from its humiliating position.</p>
<p>"This collar also has a couple of charges a spell called 'zone of truth.' No lies and deceptions from you any more. What are the elvish plans to free their slaves?" He asked.</p>
<p>Even though I felt the flowing compulsion to tell the truth, I didn't need to fight it, in fact I smiled at finally being given a chance to explain myself.</p>
<p>"There is no plan to free elven slaves, you're wrong." I explained.</p>
<p>"Then how did you come to be wearing this collar?" He asked.</p>
<p>"I put it on not knowing it's effects." I simply replied, feeling the blue mist subsiding at the sudden look of anger on Bhador's face.</p>
<p>"There's got to be more to this situation. You elves aren't usually that stupid. Why were you in Grunkle's shackle shop?" He rambled.</p>
<p>"I broke in to examine shackles." I simply replied, enjoying the site of Bhador realising what a mistake he had made assuming the worse of me.</p>
<p>"If it wasn't about freeing slaves, why were you so intrigued by shackles?" He asked, and all of a sudden, all my fear returned. I clammed up, hoping that if I didn't speak he wouldn't be able to wrangle the truth from me.</p>
<p>"Answer."</p>
<p>"I had already thrown my clothes in a forge and walked the streets naked earlier in the night and it hadn't gotten me as excited as I would have hoped. So I thought if I shackled myself that would be stupid enough to get my heart racing." I blurted out, unable to control my betraying tongue against the command and truth spells working together. Jodrolim's essence began boiling off my skin at the sight of Bhador's smile.</p>
<p>"So you're just a pervert elf who is now at my mercy? I feel like I am going to have fun playing with you. Then, when I get bored of your degradation I'll toss you down the mines for the rest of your days. How does that sound?"</p>
<p>"Bad for both of us. Yes, you have me at your mercy, but my military escort will call in reinforcements if I am harmed, and I don't think you want to have a protracted siege just to indulge your sadism on a single elf." I reasoned, the zone of truth giving my words power.</p>
<p>"You're right, we have a mutually assured destruction situation here. But one of us is still at a disadvantage and I aim to use that. If you want that collar removed before your guards arrive, you're going to have to do what I say. If I had you subject yourself to abject humiliation right up until they walked through the front door, would your pride preclude you from telling them about it?" Bhador deduced.</p>
<p>"I am traumatised from war and would not subject more troops to its horrors over something petty, so I will probably obey pretty much any order you give me to spare them that. Also considering how I ended up in this situation, I can imagine there are some I would even enjoy." I explained with tears in my eyes.</p>
<p>"Very good. Get on your hands and knees and crawl at my side." Bhador ordered. I squeezed my eyes closed tight and lowered myself down. The collar clearly had some deference to his orders as my hands were released from behind my back to allow me to begin crawling. "Dwarven high command are pretty insistent that you elves be treated to the absolute heights of our hospitality. Which means my first duty is to brief the legions of servants who will be serving you over the next couple of days. You want to come with me to thank them in advance?"</p>
<p>"Fine." I sighed in the brief moment the collar released my tongue.</p>
<p>"Oh, now that won't do at all. I'm not going to ask you a lot of questions, but when I do I expect you to reply with either 'yes, master' or 'no, master.' Plus when that drooling tongue retreats into your stupid face, I at least expect to see a smile. So let's try that again with some enthusiasm shall we?" Bhador leered at me, before clearing his throat to deliver his line clearly. "I'm going to go disgrace you in front of all of my servants, doesn't that sound like fun?"</p>
<p>"Yes, master." I replied with a grin before returning to my status as a panting dog.</p>
<p>I crawled out of his office and down some stairs that descended further and further into the bowels of the building. At one point he stopped to talk to one of the guards that had first let me in.</p>
<p>"Get another soldier and go to the guest house, you pick up this bitch's clothes and bring them back here, while your colleague stands guard outside, when her troops first arrive he is to get them to wait while you send a signal to me that they have arrived, then he is to tell them that she awoke early to breakfast with me here." He ordered. I realised a flaw in the plan and tried to voice it but was once again left gurgling and gagging. "What is it bitch?"</p>
<p>"I added my own magical protections to the guest house, you dispel them with the password 'sanctuary.'" I informed in the moment my tongue was allowed free reign. The soldier nodded and I tried not to think about him rummaging through my possessions while I was stuck at his boss's mercy.</p>
<p>There was a general commotion behind the door that Bhador had led me to. There was clearly a small crowd milling about, awaiting the instructions that would be given ahead of their busy day.</p>
<p>"Alright, I want you on your feet again so they can take you all in. Actually, wait on the other side of this door until I introduce you, I think it would be more fun for you to have an introduction and grand entrance, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, master." I replied with a smile as I got to my feet and stood to one side as he walked through the door and the crowd's murmur died down.</p>
<p>"Alright settle down everyone. Now I know we've all been dreading putting on a spread for those high and mighty elves. You remember how stuck up the last ambassador was, constantly looking down his nose at us. Well this time I've taken steps to make sure this ambassador knows her place. Come on in Ambassador Nyana!"</p>
<p>The blue mist became a raging inferno as I turned the corner and saw at least 50 dwarfs staring at me with a mixture of shock, sadism, and lust.</p>
<p>"So here's the deal. This is a complicated situation and you don't need to know the details, but the ambassador is totally at your mercy from now until her guards arrive. We will get a short warning when her guards get to the guest house, at which point she needs to be released immediately. After then we will all need to keep schtum about this in front of her guards, but it won't hurt if you can whisper a reminder here and there while you're serving her. Any questions?" Bhador explained to his excited and bemused staff.</p>
<p>"So we can do anything to her?" An eager dwarf in the front row yelled.</p>
<p>"Good point, I should be clear just in case." Bhador backtracked, realising he may not cause a diplomatic incident but one of his unthinking underlings might. "No leaving marks, or making her dirty in a way that can't quickly be cleaned. Nothing that can't be quickly covered or repaired. She needs to be handed back to her guards just as we found her. But she is also a willing part of our conspiracy, and more importantly will obey any order you give her, isn't that right bitch?"</p>
<p>"Yes, master!" I announced with a smile to a whole room looking to make me suffer.</p>
<p>"Alright, just because you have an elven slut to punish doesn't mean you don't also have jobs to do, so take turns, make it quick, then get to work." Bhador announced before retreating to a small seat in the corner to watch the ensuing chaos. All the dwarves seem to drop back to let a woman in a chef's outfit push to the front.</p>
<p>"I am the head chef and I have the most work to do, so I'll make this quick." She began, explaining why she was given such deference. "Every time you fucking elves roll into town, I spit in your food. How about I cut out the middledwarf?"</p>
<p>The collar pulling my tongue out and keeping my hands behind my back made it the most easy task imaginable for this angry dwarf to spit straight into my mouth.</p>
<p>"Now swallow." She ordered, giving the collar permission to release my tongue just so I could close my mouth to force her spit down my throat, Jodrolim's spirit swirling around to give me strength not to immediately wretch it back up. By the time I had finished, there was a new dwarf in my face, this one dressed in a suit far fancier than I would have expected in this part of the world.</p>
<p>"I am the head of the household, I have decided to step up and make sure everything is orderly with your humiliation." He stated. I noticed that most of the dwarves had taken to their duties, trusting that he would bring me round to them when the time was right. However lurking behind him were a few dwarves dressed in similar impeccable outfits. "If I am being brutally honest, your degradation holds no appeal to me, but I have some footdwarves in tow who are light on early duties and eager to manifest the magistrate's designs on you. Of especial note is Mr. Trogbar here."</p>
<p>With minimal introduction, the dwarf the head of the household referred to stepped forward and didn't even speak before roughly grabbing my breasts.</p>
<p>"During big fancy visits, VIPs often get a designated footdwarf to attend to their duties. Today I am assigned to you." Trogbar informed as he caressed me. Next he actually grabbed my tongue and maliciously started pulling my head around and laughing at the indignity. "So every time that whore mouth barks an order at me, I want you to think back to this moment when you were in your place."</p>
<p>As a final insult, the dwarf rubbed his finger between my labia, teasing the border between my external and my very much internal. After a few seconds he removed his finger, then shoved it into my open mouth, forcing me to taste myself.</p>
<p>This pattern continued, with each member of the household staff taking it in turns to voice their resentment of having to serve me, mixed with acts of violation to highlight their dominance. Nobody dared engage in the ultimate violation in front of their colleagues, but I was squeezed, spanked, slapped, tickled, and at one point even forced to lick a dwarf's boots. At every turn I thrilled in enduring this hardship with the raging spirit of Jodrolim flowing around me. I was not alone, we faced this ordeal together and drew such strength from each other that I felt stronger as a lowly wretch with his support than I ever felt as a respected ambassador without him. In fact I spent quite some time daydreaming about how much damage I could have done in this rage had I not been restrained.</p>
<p>Next I was shown to the kitchen area, the head chef looked angry at me, like I had already endured her humiliation and now I was just wasting her time and distracting the other kitchen workers.</p>
<p>"Here." The head chef yelled, thrusting a vegetable peeler into my hands. "There's a pile of carrots, turnips, and parsnips that need peeling. While you're being a distracting whore you might as well make yourself useful."</p>
<p>As I slowly walked over to the cooking station they had set aside for me, a chef clearly in a middle of a task didn't even break his stride to give my tits an almighty slap in passing, they were still bouncing with recoil when I began to peel the first carrot.</p>
<p>If anything, being given physical labour was quite thrilling, with Jodrolim's guidance I was able to move quickly and efficiently, peeling vegetables like a pro, despite the constant slapping and mocking from other members of the kitchen staff.</p>
<p>"Terrible." One pretty junior member chef mocked. "You call this an even peel, this carrot is a million miles from smooth. Here, let me show you in a way you'll understand."</p>
<p>Immediately I knew what he meant to do and felt no hesitation slightly spreading my legs to make it easier for him. Indeed moments later I felt a carrot pressing at my pussy, before my labia relented and the root vegetable was thrust inside of me. It was cold and rough, as physically distracting as it was humiliatingly occupying my mind, and yet all I did was let out a weak moan as I continued to peel vegetables.</p>
<p>Just to drive home the point, the chef then took a handful of peelings and stuffed them in my open mouth before returning to work. I left the peelings in my mouth and the carrot in my pussy until the head of household informed me it was time to move on.</p>
<p>At the young chef's behest, I was held just for a moment so that I could watch him take the carrot from out of me and place it in a pot.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I'll make sure the carrot that was in your pussy ends up on your plate." He jibed as I was taken away.</p>
<p>I was led through the house, servants at every turn cleaning and polishing, getting everything clean for someone they now knew was dirty. I was taken to the banquet hall, where most of the effort was being made, and was made to stand next to the chair I would be sitting in when I returned to lonely propriety after this ordeal was over.</p>
<p>"I didn't clean your chair, I figured you should have to lick it clean." A senior looking member of the cleaning staff explained. I took a deep breath and kneeled next to my chair, but was suddenly pulled back. "Not so fast, let's make it a challenge."</p>
<p>All the cleaning staff stopped what they were doing and gathered round, each with designs on my chair. One placed some scraps from the bin there, another emptied out a dustpan, a third wrung out a sponge over it, assuring me it has just been used to clean the privy. Soon the summary of the mess they had cleaned had been placed on my chair and I gingerly leaned over.</p>
<p>"Magistrate, the guards have reached the guest house." A soldier interrupted, to the groans of the household staff.</p>
<p>"Alright." The magistrate sighed as he once again took charge of the situation. "Guess you'll only have time to lick your chair three times before we're done. Make them good, any remaining mess will still be there later."</p>
<p>The blue mist had subsided at the news of my release, but rushed back at the discovery that I was not yet off the hook. I kneeled down and the staff cheered as I allowed my tongue to run across the seat, picking up all manner of filth along the way. I once again drew on Jodrolim's hardier constitution to keep me from wretching and to instead return for a second lick. Finally, I decided as a grand finale to make my third lick trace the circumference of the seat, gathering up all filth from the edge as the staff jeered and chided me. Then, Bhador grabbed me by the hair and dragged me away, back to his private office.</p>
<p>As I entered the room, I saw my chest of clothes, the ordeal was over. However as I tried to rush over to them, Bhador gripped my hair tighter, holding me by his side.</p>
<p>"One last thing before you go back to being the high and mighty ambassador." He sneered. Using my hair he directed me to his desk and bent me over. I knew what was coming, my final debasement. I bit my bottom lip and felt positively on fire as his cock pushed its way into my pussy.</p>
<p>During my phases of delirium, I was no stranger to casual sex, but it always felt numb and distant, like a seasoned soldier reading reports of far away battles. But this time, with Jodrolim's raging spirit embracing my body as my captor violated me, it was the most real my sex had ever felt. I was once again being intimate with my lost love, our vortex of fear and anger diving deep to drill out an exhilaration I thought long lost. Whose cock was in my pussy didn't matter, I was having sex with Jodrolim and it made me feel whole in a way nothing else had even approached.</p>
<p>As I felt a spurt of semen fill my pussy, I moaned and squirmed and never wanted it to end. But as soon as it had started, I felt a calm wash over me as Jodrolim's spirit returned to the great beyond.</p>
<p>"Alright, you better get dressed before your guards get here and make a fuss." Bhador explained, placing his thumb on a point on the collar so it sprung off my neck, releasing me from its spell. I quickly threw on a gown and made myself presentable, just in time for there to be a knock on the office door.</p>
<p>Bhador's semen was still dripping from my pussy as I explained to Commander Stillstar that he needn't have rushed over, I was fine.</p>
<p>The fatigue from my all night and early morning activities caught up with me all at once and Bhador agreed that I could sleep in his office under the pretence of a long private meeting. He awoke me at lunch time and I made my way to the official reception.</p>
<p>Commander Stillstar occasionally would tell me that he sensed some irreverence from the dwarven household staff. Indeed their tone was a bit familiar, their knowing stares and whispered judgements were part of a strange atmosphere my retinue did not have the missing piece of information to decode.</p>
<p>There was some tittering when I took my seat, some even noticed the brief and faint blue wisp as I bit into my roast carrot, it all seemed just a bit off. Nevertheless, for me it was a refreshing return to normalcy, proof positive that the after effects of my poor decisions would last only until I left the town. Soon Commander Stillstar returned to his usual role of rolling his eyes while I drank ale in the raucous way of the dwarves.</p>
<p>"How about some games?" I yelled with a plan in my mind.</p>
<p>"Are you sure that's wise?" The Commander meekly intruded.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, I forgot how improper it is for any elf of rank to be seen having fun. But I feel like the magistrate is on the level, so how about you wait outside so I don't end up damaging your delicate sensibilities?" I ranted. Commander took the bait and walked outside.</p>
<p>"So here's what I was thinking, do you know how to play rune bones?" I asked, seeing the magistrate's eyes light up.</p>
<p>"Indeed, but I do not play for fun, I wager and I wager hard." He replied, his attitude was a common one around dwarves who like the game.</p>
<p>"As do I, but as we are both of a level of wealth that makes monetary wagers boring, let's play for some real stakes. If I win, you agree to the proposal I was sent to make, the freedom of all elven slaves to be replaced with POWs from our war with men." I proposed.</p>
<p>"Blast my bellows! You'd think I'd wager such a humiliating prize on a game of rune bones?" He exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I think you will when you hear what I am wagering. If you win, I dismiss my guard for the next 3 days, then I put that collar back on." I continued, the blue mist rising up around me again, stilling my beating heart at the horrific bet I had just proposed.</p>
<p>"3 days of you under my complete control. You don't realise the depths of what I'm capable of with such time and power." Bhador warned.</p>
<p>"Well, unless you put up, you probably don't realise it either." I goaded.</p>
<p>"Fine, I agree with your wager, let's play." He announced as I once again felt the raging presence of Jodrolim guiding my hand.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>"So how did the negotiations go?" Commander Stillstar asked as I exhaustedly left Bhador's parlour.</p>
<p>"You may detract from my methods, commander, but you cannot argue with my results. I have, in hand, a signed and sealed agreement with the magistrate that all elven slaves will be released." I announced.</p>
<p>Jodrolim was always unbelievably lucky at rune bones.</p>
<p>I left Thrommtin, buoyed and elated. I had gotten everything I wanted out of my visit and felt thoroughly satisfied. I sent a runner with the signed agreement to elven high command and got a reply by hawk asking if I could look into turning lead to gold next. I looked out over the horizon, our next destination was a strange conurbation of small agricultural villages I was certain to figure out a way to have fun in, but for now I was enjoying the calm between storms.</p>
<p>Four days into our ride we received another hawk, only this one carried the golden symbol of the Imperial Legate, the highest ranking military officer in the region, answerable only to the elven royal family. It was not addressed to me but to Commander Stillstar.</p>
<p>The commander read the letter and immediately reacted like his proctologist had suddenly learned shocking grasp part way through his appointment.</p>
<p>"Madam Ambassador, I have received orders from a source much higher than needed to give such orders. We are to return you to Morningdew as fast as our horse's health will allow." He informed me, his skin somehow turning even paler than the exceeding pale baseline set by nature.</p>
<p>"If we are to be fast, there's no point in rushing and tiring ourselves out." I firmly stated. "We are carrying too much luggage to be travelling at a gallop. I suggest we quick march over long hours. I will get out of my carriage and carry my belongings alongside to enhance our stamina, I don't need to be carried."</p>
<p>My impropriety always drew the ire of Commander Stillstar, but in this matter he was thankful for my esprit de corps. Just about the most important person to him was asking for a speedy return and I was aiding him in this matter. I wondered if this would at least give him some insight into why my methods with dwarves should not be looked upon with total contempt.</p>
<p>The truth was I was happy to get my marching orders, my heart was already racing with fear at the sudden recall. Why was my presence at the capital city so important? If they discovered even a measure of my impropriety, they couldn't just fire me on the road, not with my confidential knowledge. But if that were the case they wouldn't need the Imperial Legate to convey such a message, or such a rush to return me.</p>
<p>I knew my behaviour at Thrommtin was stupid, in fact that's why I did it. It was bound to catch up with me eventually, I just wish it hadn't caught up with me immediately. My anger at myself awoke Jodrolim from the beyond to give me such strength during our quick march that it ended up putting my military escort to shame.</p>
<p>From deep in the dwarven territory in the south to the elven capital city in only 9 days was an incredible feat, and I certainly believe we could have made it 8 of Commander Stillstar had not insisted that I be borne the last leg of the journey, surmising that were his ambassadorial charge presented to the powers that be sweaty, dishevelled, and tired, it would reflect poorly enough on him to undo the praise he would receive over our impressively fast return.</p>
<p>When we approached the gate, there was a flurry of activity to let us in. My commander and his team were taken to a high garrison for a debrief, while I was sped away to the foreign ministry confused and worried.</p>
<p>As my carriage rolled through the majestic streets lined with marble pillars and magically augmented artistry, I wondered the most worrisome things. Even with the fear of the unknown waiting for me, I could only think about if there was some corner of this town I would not be recognised if I chose to bring my dangerous game to home territory.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry was one grand marble building among many, housed in an area of the city set aside for all important marble buildings that encircled the royal estate like butlers around a dinner table.</p>
<p>At the entrance, I was told I was expected in the ministerial office. I made my way to the grandest door with the most heavy duty privacy spells known to elfkind and knocked politely. I was shown in by my supervisor, Junior Minister Willowbark, but as I turned the door I realised he was not pulling the strings in this situation.</p>
<p>Standing next to the desk was the foreign minister herself, looking like poor posture had just become a capital offence. While sitting behind the desk, in unmistakable royal regalia was Prince Sylvir of the House Morningdew, 4th in line to the throne and by all accounts the highest ranking royal who actually does any work.</p>
<p>"Ambassador Nyana Springdew!" He beckoned with an unexpected levity. His face was not one that seemed accustomed to smiling so such a reaction seemed as genuine as it was unsettling. He immediately clocked my confusion and turn conciliatory. "Ah, I see the purpose of your speedy return was not made clear to you, that is understandable given how quickly the order had to work its way through the chain of command."</p>
<p>With a reaction that suggested a practised familiarity with dynamic briefing, the foreign minister placed a folder in front of the prince.</p>
<p>"When we first received word that you had convinced the vicious Magistrate of Thrommtin to release our captured kin, we thought it was some kind of trick or political manoeuvre on his part. When we sent a military unit with an apparent mission to escort our freed slaves, we sent a small unit prepared for disappointment or even ambush." The prince explained with such familiarity you would be forgiven for thinking he himself had been making these orders rather than catching up on a bureaucracy designed to prevent his embarrassment.</p>
<p>"One thousand three hundred and seventy seven. That is how many sons and daughters of our nation will be returning to the capital soon thanks to your diplomacy. I hope you will forgive this prince a lapse in regal decorum, but how on earth did you pull off such an unbelievable achievement?"</p>
<p>I was now convinced the purpose of my return to the capital was not disciplinary. Not unless I decided to tell the prince the truth. I did for a second imagine it, looking at a member of the royal family dead in the eyes and informing him that I had secured the release of through a long process that began with my deviant sexual domination and ended with my reckless gambling to try and vicariously recapture the thrill I had only recently experienced through total subjugation to even the lowest dwarf in Thrommtin.</p>
<p>"From my time in the military, I gained insight into how dwarves socially function. Sometimes I can see unorthodox ways of engagement that are unique to their culture and can often win their respect and open doors that would be otherwise closed to other, more intimidatingly educated elves." I reported back, choosing my words carefully to not insult the diplomats who had come before me.</p>
<p>"Unorthodox is certainly a way to describe it. I've been reading the reports Commander Stillstar has been sending about you." The prince replied, turning over another sheet placed in front of him. "In the past year he has used the phrase 'unorthodox' 34 times, 'unusual' 27 times, 'unprofessional' 18 times, 'improper' 16 times, and 'bonkers' 4 times."</p>
<p>It was some revelation that the captain of my guard felt that way so deeply that he would give voice to his dissent, I wondered how he would have felt had I managed to get past the guards at the gate the night I put on the collar.</p>
<p>"Commander Stillstar is first and foremost concerned with my safety, after all that is his charge. His concern extends beyond my physical wellbeing to my social standing. I'm thankful he cares enough to respectfully push back against my excesses even if it can cause friction. I am also thankful that he is reporting back with candour rather than reacting to my methods with indulgent subterfuge." I once again diplomatically responded.</p>
<p>"Well after this week I'm sure we will see something of an attitude adjustment in Commander Stillstar." The prince chuckled. He pushed aside his papers and looked me dead in the eyes, this was no longer a briefing, I was now getting the unfiltered weight of the prince's problems.</p>
<p>"There has been some discontent over our alliance with the dwarves. Some very out of touch elements of society feel that as the war is now a protracted stalemate, our alliance has run its course. I have forcefully made it clear that the only reason we are in a protracted stalemate rather than wholesale defeat is our alliance. But when the benefit of an arrangement is maintaining the status quo, the costs become more stark to those who have to bear them. To put it bluntly I was desperately looking for a win for the alliance, and then miraculously, an ambassador on a routine mission secures the release of over a thousand elves held in bondage."</p>
<p>"The reason you were recalled with such urgency is that when that crowd of freedom returns to the city, we are going to give them the warmest welcome we can muster, we are going to make a parade out of this success. The royal family, the military brass, key dwarven members of the alliance, we are all going to be there to tout this victory. I thought it only fair that the ambassador who secured their freedom be a part of that retinue, your family have also been sent for and of course you are entitled to bring any guests you wish. I have also arranged that during the festivities you are to be presented with a diamond dewdrop."</p>
<p>This should have been an honour. I should have been overwhelmed by the scale of my success. I was to be a guest of honour at a royal parade and then presented with the highest honour an elf can be bestowed, the diamond dewdrop, a medal without metal, given only to the most heroic elves throughout history.</p>
<p>But all my rushing mind could think of is that the one guest I would love to have present at such an affair would not be in attendance. I struggled to think of a reason Jodrolim wouldn't be there, it certainly wasn't likely I would receive any privacy or anonymity for the duration of my stay. I would probably have to be careful as if a blue mist starts arising around me while I'm in the presence of the royal family, I'm fairly certain their guards would move in in case I was a deep agent conjuring up their doom. Plus my parents were going to be there, they didn't even know about my tryst with Jodrolim let alone how far their baby girl had fallen.</p>
<p>The prince was looking at me expectantly, he was expecting some sort of appropriate response and I had nothing. Panicking my brain latched onto an avenue of discussion that would keep this focussed on business.</p>
<p>"My guards, is there plans to reward them for their service as well?" I asked.</p>
<p>"They are all to be finely rewarded, although one point of discussion is Commander Stillstar. His opposition to your methods is well known throughout military brass, with your newfound status as diplomatic hero, the status quo cannot continue." The Prince informed, it was clear that the commander's fate was in my hands. I felt for the elf, he was a point of opposition at every turn, but I'm still not entirely sure he was in the wrong. My story could have ended very differently if it hadn't been for blind luck.</p>
<p>"I do not wish for Commander Stillstar to be punished for executing his duties faithfully, with a commitment undampened by our spirited disagreements." I quickly replied.</p>
<p>"Oh, punishment is not on the table. If you want a guardsman more accommodating of your methods, then Commander Stillstar would still be handsomely rewarded for the job he has done so far and given a very desirable commission elsewhere." The prince reassured. "However I must warn you that with your newfound status, Commander Stillstar cannot remain in charge of your newer and larger guard unit at his current rank. If you remain firm that you wish to keep him, he would need to receive a double promotion to the rank of Legus, a very powerful position to give to someone on the record as in continuous opposition to you."</p>
<p>There was a slight blue wisp as I agreed that Stillstar needed to stay as head of my guardsmen.</p>
<p>"...and naturally I couldn't get pissed with my parents and the royal family knocking elbows in the palace, so the party just felt like more work." I slurred to the innkeeper, feeling the relief of finally being in an environment to bitch about a day of honours elves would kill for (and looking at the history of diamond dewdrop recipients, most had). It had been almost a month since the big day and I had finally arrived at the connurbation of agricultural villages that had first been my destination when I departed Thrommtin.</p>
<p>"And don't get me started on the dress they gave me. It was worth what I make in a month and I'm not exactly scraping by. They wanted me elegant and alluring, so the royal wardrobe presented me with the sluttiest adorned fabric I had ever seen. Seriously, for all their talk of propriety, I couldn't believe they were the ones giving me a slinky shimmering dewdrop outfit that had a dress slit up to my hip bones and needed a magic infused fabric to keep my tits from popping out."</p>
<p>"Begging your pardon, ma'am, but this is certainly a conversation above a humble innkeeper." The stout dwarf replied as he continued to focus on wiping clean the same flagon that was in his hand as I arrived.</p>
<p>"Don't you start with that fucking properness nonsense. I get enough of that from Legus Stillstar. By all accounts he went from a career-endingly shit day, where a prince of the realm was reading his shit-talking of someone they were currently throwing a parade for, to becoming one of the most celebrated military members of the moment. And you better believe his commanding officer made damn sure he knew that was because I went to the bat for him. Now every sentence he speaks to me comes with a fucking hour of honourifics and provisos. As if that's what I want, he should just call me a cunt and get it over with." I ranted. "By the way, super happy I am finally in company where I can swear."</p>
<p>"I guess." The dwarf grunted.</p>
<p>"This place seems pretty dead though, I remember when farming villages had the most lively taverns." I indelicately noticed.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid your arrival was a bit late for that. This place was as lively as you remember but 2 hours ago. Maybe if you turned in for the night you can arrive earlier and catch the dwarvenfolk tomorrow?" The innkeeper suggested with the subtlty of a carrot in the pussy.</p>
<p>"Well, I can see you're finished for the night. Is it possible that I could go for a walk and come back to bed without disturbing you?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Only locks in this building are the magical ones you put on your room. We don't get many outsiders and we trust our locals." The innkeeper quickly informed, practically changing into his pyjamas as he did so.</p>
<p>"In which case, good night." I beckoned, stepping out of the front door and looking out across the sparse countryside ahead of me.</p>
<p>As I walked further into the night, leaving the inn further and further behind me, I tried to get myself worked up for another night of wild emotions. After everything that had gone wrong in Thrommtin, I was now striding through the unknown to find a means to subject myself to such a situation again.</p>
<p>Open fields did not lend themselves well to mischief, the only thrill I could think of was that of larger exposure, of having nowhere to hide. I decided that, as that was the case, I should once again resort to the total destruction of my propriety and began to remove my clothes.</p>
<p>Standing naked in the fields, I knew I was supposed to feel that familiar mix of anger and fear, the strong pre-battle emotions that called forth the wrath of the ancestors. But instead I felt a rush of exhilaration. I carried my clothes to the edge of the field where an irrigation channel bubbled away at my feet. My arms relaxed and the weight from pile of fabric fell away, landing in the stream with a subtle plop that cut through the still night.</p>
<p>"Alright." I said aloud to myself. "I'm naked and exposed. I can be seen for miles around and anyone who sees me could do whatever they wanted to me."</p>
<p>I stood there, nervously stroking my naked body, more embarrassed by my plan's failure than the plan itself.</p>
<p>"Come on Jodrolim, I fucking need you." I weeped, rapidly losing the correct headspace and instead collapsing into a ball, the mud of the field clinging to my body.</p>
<p>Throughout my drunken pain, my brain somehow managed to latch onto a nugget of resolve. I picked myself up again and looked around for anything that could give me the rush I was craving. Far off in the distance I saw a large building adjacent to a farmhouse that I knew would could contain farm equipment, supplies, and maybe even some farm animals. Surely that would provide something I would regret. I immediately made a beeline towards the building and soon regretted choosing such a far away destination.</p>
<p>It took almost an hour for me to reach what I later figured out was a barn, remembering the innkeeper's views on everyone trusting everyone, I pushed the door and found it unlocked.</p>
<p>Inside I saw huge piles of grain, the threshing equipment on the wall speaking to it's inevitable fate once it had been sufficiently dried. However beyond that I saw the stalls that contained the beasts of the field, two oxen used to pull ploughs, harvesters and mills when needed. At first I considered tying myself in the stall with them, doing something so that I was at risk of the owner waking up in the morning and discovering a new work creature under their control. However as I approached their pen I realised their conditions were so tight, I was very likely to be trampled under hoof the moment I took one step in.</p>
<p>Instead I looked to the various harnesses and domestication tools that were near the oxen. At first I tried on a harness, but the oxen were so much bigger than me it was simply comical. I tried seeing if I could pull any of the devices, but with Jodrolim's strength refusing to come to me, it was once again simply embarrassing.</p>
<p>But within the cart I found what was to be my salvation, a length of plaited leather I immediately recognised as a bullwhip. I unfurled it and felt the hard leather tapering to a fine tip. I gave it a practice whip and found it to be too effective, the loud crack causing the oxen to become panicky. I decided to take my degradation to the middle of the field where anyone could see it but also where it would not spook the livestock.</p>
<p>As I stood in the middle of the field, I held the whip out in front of me, then I whirled it over my shoulder, aiming to hit myself with it. It gave me a meek collision with my shoulder blade and back. Clearly I was going to need some practice. At the fourth attempt I finally got the trademark crack, albeit nowhere near my body. By the eighth or ninth attempt I figured out the right technique, letting the whip roll over my shoulders, bridge the gap over my eagerly arched back, and come cracking down on my exposed bottom.</p>
<p>I felt a zing of pain on my cheek and immediately growled with anticipation. With my technique figured out I rolled the whip much harder this time and felt the explosion of pain on my bottom echo with the cracking sound that filled the air. I screamed to the heavens and was answered by a familiar presence, the blue mist swirling around me, lighting the small section of the field I set aside for self-flagellation. I cracked the whip over my bottom again and felt the rush of rage mix with Jodrolim's presence and the sting of pain to drive me wild. My hand darted between my legs and started pleasuring myself.</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>I whipped myself a few more times, each time feeling a rush of rage, the blue mist reacting to each whip crack like a burst of a bellows on a roaring fire. For his part, Jodrolim seemed to lend his dwarven endurance to my punished bottom, keeping the damage as minimised as possible, until I felt myself falling to an almighty orgasm there in the fields.</p>
<p>'What is wrong with that farmer?' I thought to myself as I stood up, alone but satisfied. 'Here I am cracking a whip and giving myself a screaming orgasm and they didn't even wake up.'</p>
<p>I began the long walk back to the inn.</p>
<p>'Unless they did and kept quiet.' The thought of a farmer peeking out of their window and watching my show allowed a little flicker of blue to return to me and keep me warm in the cold night air.</p>
<p>When I got back to the inn I felt a little disappointed that the adventure had been a bit of a dud. I was satisfied that any time I could spend with Jodrolim was better than nothing and I fell asleep with a reformed eagerness to connect again soon.</p>
<p>I was strangely bereft of orders when we departed the various community leaders of the agricultural lands we had found ourselves in. We had achieved some goodwill and even shared some seeds that some smart elf somewhere thought would assist their crop rotations. It felt like back to the gruntwork of diplomacy that I remembered.</p>
<p>My bottom still felt sore and I relished the reminder of once again feeling Jodrolim by my side. It felt like cheating to call upon physical pain, but I at least felt comforted that it didn't count as self harm as long as Jodrolim was with me.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>That unpleasant thought process became buried as Legus Stillstar brought our convoy to a halt in a forest that seemed like a whimsical place to stay and await orders. We set up a camp and I assigned light duties to the guards as we sent hawks and runners to figure out what our next move was.</p>
<p>I was happy to be without orders for a bit. I had satisfied myself and now I was getting no end of joy seeing the emotional pain being told to relax was causing Legus Stillstar. He eventually managed to settle into light drills and reading military strategy books to pass the time, but I could tell he almost kissed the hawk that arrived with our next assignment.</p>
<p>As I told him our next stop, his face dropped and he probably wished he was just a listless soldier once more.</p>
<p>"Gelder Forgefire!" he exclaimed, even his heightened sense of propriety lost to his disbelief. "Begging your pardon but I am shocked that high command would risk one of our most valuable ambassadors on, let's not mince words here, a brutal warlord. Maybe once we are finished we can go reason with the ancient dragon of Sharpspear forest."</p>
<p>"Legus Stillstar, if I'd known I'd get some genuine emotion out of you I would have volunteered to visit Gelder Forgefire long ago." I japed, although Legus Stillstar did not see the funny side. "It makes sense that they would send the ambassador with the best track records of securing the release of slaves to the magistrate with the largest number of elven slaves imprisoned within her district."</p>
<p>"This isn't the legacy elves from forgotten wars that were released from Thrommtin. The ambush invasion of Glimmerlake was a cynical and cowardly attack. What kind of dwarf sees the elven soldiers heading to the front to repel the hoard of men on the basis of a treaty not yet ratified and sees an opportunity for expansion and mass enslavement? I have met the broken soldiers who retreated, leaving behind the town to her evil machinations." The Legus rambled.</p>
<p>"Indeed it is a sore spot between our kingdoms. But that's all the more reason to begin diplomacy. The status of the occupied land of Glimmerlake will need to be resolved if this war ever ends and those talks need to start now." I replied.</p>
<p>"Any ending that doesn't end with the arrest and punishment of Gelder Forgefire is a failure." Legus Stillstar sneered as he went to gather his elves.</p>
<p>Glimmerlake had been transformed by Gelder's command. The ornate elven houses were crudely adapted for various industrial purposes while the scenic vistas were cut off by a giant rampart to guard the ill-gotten land. even the eponymous lake was now polluted from the industrial runoff that accompanied Gelder's big plans for a town whose previous dominant industries were panning the lakeside for gemstones and tourism.</p>
<p>Our retinue reached the gate, a thick layer of unease laying heavy upon us as the dwarven guard instructed us to wait. This was clearly a power play, a deliberate demonstration that we were to play by Gelder's rules on Gelder's terms. After an hour waiting at the gate, we were told how honoured we should feel that Magistrate Forgefire had decided to personally escort us to the magistrate's mansion.</p>
<p>After a bit more time, there was a bellow of trumpets as the large metal gate swung open to reveal a solid block of Gelder's military, all in a tight formation staring us down. Slowly they parted to allow an ornate carriage to approach. The carriage was of a design that you would usually expect 4 horses to be pulling it around, however this one was being pulled by 8 elves, all of them dressed in leather outfits designed to look like the humanoid equivalent of a horse harness. The total derision for her slave's sentence stitched into every panel of their harnesses. Much like horses they had a bit between their teeth, blinders either side of their eyes, and their long elvish hair had been tied back into a ponytail and plaited to resemble show horses.</p>
<p>Soon the carriage driver pulled hard on the reigns and the slaves groaned in unison as they brought the carriage to rest and allowed a beaming dwarf to step out. Gelder Forgefire, her flowing red hair cascading down the fine red and black ceremonial armour she had commissioned herself to work with a theme of intense fire that she carried with every powerful step she took towards us.</p>
<p>"Greetings Ambassador Springdew, and welcome to Wetforge." Gelder announced, taunting me with the new name she had given Glimmerlake as much as she was through a brazen display of contempt for elves.</p>
<p>"Well met Magistrate Forgefire." I cordially replied, hoping to direct her eyes away from a certain Legus who was not hiding his contempt for her outrage strategy well at all. "Thank you for meeting us at the gate, you needn't have extended such hospitality."</p>
<p>"Well I knew you would be weary from your travels and I figured I would offer you a ride in my carriage." Gelder replied with a smug grin, a disarming tone of paper thin respect. Bhador, like most magistrates, had been polite because he had spent long enough swimming in politics to know that his dark side needed to be hidden. Gelder's politeness came from a more vicious place, it was almost elven in its arrogance, that she was above goading us and was comfortable enough with civil disrespect to layer it on thick, hoping that her target would snap and prove her right about everything.</p>
<p>"Thank you kindly for the offer, but I have brought my own carriage and would prefer time to freshen up before being in close quarters with someone as well put together as yourself." I countered. "However, if permissible I would love to store my conveyance within the same premises as yours, it looks well taken care of."</p>
<p>"Thank you. Elven gilding is difficult to maintain but you must agree the effect is second to none." Gelder explained, subtly throwing in the depths of her use of seized elven citizens. We made our pleasantries before returning to our respective coaches for the journey into the town.</p>
<p>"How can you be so chummy with someone who so clearly detests our very race?" Legus Stillstar growled as we rode.</p>
<p>"She is trying to bait us to anger, this is still a vassal state of the dwarven kingdom and her superiors ordered this meeting against her will. She couldn't say no as support from the dwarven kingdom is the only reason we haven't marched to take this territory back, she has to keep them happy and they want this alliance to work. So her only purpose is to show us as not worthy of that respect in the future. She can only do that in a public forum with witnesses though and once we are behind closed doors I can become more firm." I explained, the logic of the situation not cooling the Legus's hot head.</p>
<p>Eventually we pulled up to the magistrate's house and were shown in by dwarven guards. The house was pristine, maintained to the standards of the most persnickety elf by a legion of Gelder's enslaved. The elves scuttled around in black and white servants outfits with metal collars around their neck. Legus Stillstar and I were shown to a seating area, while the remainder of our party waited outside. We were immediately brought tankards of ale to drink while we awaited Gelder's arrival from a more circuitous route.</p>
<p>"So then..." Gelder announced, bursting through the door. "What plans have we during your stay in my humble dominion?"</p>
<p>I finished my ale before I started talking, noting the interest it generated from Gelder that I didn't shy away from a drink she assumed would make me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Well, my protocol is usually not to do any negotiating or discussion on the day of our arrival, we are weary from travel and would need to be of quick wit to discuss lofty matters of state." I explained.</p>
<p>"And let me guess, instead of taking advantage of my hospitality, you wish to stay at one of the common establishments in the town?" Gelder chuckled. "We dwarves talk, your ways are known to me."</p>
<p>"May I ask which dwarves you talk to? Just so I can save you time on explaining what you already know." I diplomatically replied, although my stomach fizzed at the worst implications of what she was saying."</p>
<p>"If you're asking if Bhador told me how you secured the release of his slaves, don't worry, you still have the element of surprise there. But don't get too cocky, the reason I don't know is that I have not had a word to say to that capitulating traitor since he bent the knee to your bosses." Gelder sneered, giving me a calculated peek behind her mask of civility, not realising the depths of relief she had just given to me. "But on the question of staying at a common establishment, I'm afraid that is out of the question. In Wetforge there are no free elves, you would be subdued and returned to one of the slave masters the moment you were seen."</p>
<p>"Surely, as ruler of the domain, there are steps you can take to bring me under your protection?" I asked, delighting in the diplomatic chess move I had presented. Gelder now had to either admit she was not as powerful as she first claimed, or accommodate my request, either path an embarrassing acknowledgement of weakness.</p>
<p>"I could issue you a writ, but my attitude to elves is so well known I can see dwarves in the town assuming it's a forgery and taking matters into their own hands before I have a chance to clean it up." Gelder prevaricated.</p>
<p>"Well then maybe you could accompany me?" I suggested. I could see the look on her face, the idea of being seen chumming around with an elf appalled her but she could not start our visit off on such a sour note..</p>
<p>"A fabulous idea, alas I will be working into the night ensuring you are treated to the heights of hospitality. So with all options exhausted, I must insist that tonight you stay within the Magistrate's mansion." Gelder blustered, putting an end to our first passive aggressive verbal skirmish.</p>
<p>"And my entourage?" I asked.</p>
<p>"This is where things get a little awkward, the only facilities within Wetforge that can house a contingent of elves in that size are some currently unused slave quarters." Gelder explained, the wide grin on her face confirming how hilarious she found the situation.</p>
<p>"Well, my guards are a highly trained military unit, they have endured worse conditions." I shrugged it off, gripping Legus Stillstar's leg under the table to still his tongue. "Let us make arrangements and then turn in for the night."</p>
<p>"Very good, if you need anything, just order one of the slaves and they will bring it over to you." Gelder smugly suggested as she left us to prepare.</p>
<p>"You trust her to place us in slave quarters and then just release us in the morning?" Legus Stillstar asked with the utmost disbelief.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, but I do know the full stakes here. The dwarven rulers know her attitude to elves, as do our superiors, so we drafted up the rules of engagement ahead of time. If any harm befalls a single one of us, if after the visit I do not report back a clean bill of health for the whole unit, even if a subordinate treats us with disrespect and goes unpunished, the dwarven kingdom will pull all support from Gelder. So if she captures and enslaves us, it will be the price we pay to allow Glimmerlake's liberation within the month." I explained.</p>
<p>"And the relentless disrespect? We just leave that unpunished?" He replied.</p>
<p>"If we strike first, she gets to indulge her sadism without consequence, so we will be the picture of good behaviour." I ordered as we left the house to explain the living situation to guards. "However, while you are in the slave quarters, take intense and detailed notes of how the place operates, we will be liberating all our kind eventually, and I'm sure if diplomacy fails, your assessment of the situation will be critical for alternative arrangements."</p>
<p>This order returned the smile to Legus Stillstar's face.</p>
<p>The sun had set, and my guards had taken to their quarters when I returned to the Magistrate's mansion alone. I was met at the door by Gelder, who showed me in. The mansion now seemed abandoned, all guards and slaves gone, Gelder wanted this to be just the two of us and I saw value in the opportunity as well.</p>
<p>"Now that it's unofficial, just the two of us, you won't get your high strung elven panties in a twist if I talk like a normal dwarf will you?" Gelder began, slowly walking towards some stairs, her back turned to me, displaying how not only did she not fear me, but that she expected me to follow her.</p>
<p>"Depends on how big of a bitch you're planning to be." I bluntly replied.</p>
<p>"There we go! One sentence explains more about your successes than that whole flouncy bullshit with everyone watching." Gelder laughed. "But in answer to what you said, I'm planning on being a huge bitch."</p>
<p>Gelder led me through two large mahogany doors into an office that was covered in intricate gilding and gemstones. It was the work of ancient elven artisans who had desired the seat of power to project the light that Glimmerlake was known for.</p>
<p>"Every time I step in this office I feel like I need a forge mask to protect my eyes. This is where I found the elven leader when I first marched into this town, hiding behind his desk like a coward. I kept the office because like all elven things it came with a dark side." Gelder reached under a desk and pulled something. There was a loud knock that came from a bookcase to one side. Gelder then walked over, pulled the secret bookcase door open, and invited me into the tunnel that led somewhere unknowable.</p>
<p>The tunnel descended and squirmed in such a way I could tell it was leading to a secret basement. Eventually we came to another locked door and Gelder pulled out a key to unlock it.</p>
<p>Gelder had converted the secret basement into an office with a far more dwarven aesthetic. There were torches on the wall, everything was made with sturdy oak or stone, there were even decorative axes behind her robust desk. These are not what caught my eye though.</p>
<p>What caught my eye were the 4 elves, stripped naked, and placed inside decorative metal restraints designed to convert them into display pieces for Gelder's office. 2 male elves facing away from me and 2 female elves that were looking at me with fear and embarrassment.</p>
<p>Gelder had taken to them with pure malice to make them as degraded as possible. Their nipples were pierced, with a chain stretching between them, their heads had been shaved, stripping them of any dignity they could try and salvage and on the two facing away I could see the slave brand on their bottoms, demonstrating that even if I freed them, they would be forever marked by this experience.</p>
<p>As I took in the disgraceful degradation of my kind, a few wisps of blue arose around me. These people had not volunteered to subject themselves to such debasement as I had in the past. The reality of the abuse that I had played with for my own amusement hit me like a warhammer to the gut. I pushed down my fury, fury that someone would do this and fury that I had detached myself so much from the pain it caused.</p>
<p>"I figured this was the right environment for me to lay out my position on your kind." Gelder began as she idly ran her hands over the naked elven flesh on the way back to her desk. "I am aware that since Bhador released his elven slaves, he has been receiving more than adequate compensation in terms of man slaves and other goods. Your elven masters want to encourage others to release their slaves with showers of prosperity, but I want to make myself clear. I wouldn't care if I was offered one hundred non-elves for each elf here, I would still tell them to go fuck themselves."</p>
<p>"Why do you hate elves so much? Did one of my kind toss you a pity fuck and leave before you woke up?" I asked, trying to derail Gelder's self-indulgence. One of the decorative elven women let out a slight chuckle and immediately her face contorted with fear. Gelder walked over to that elf's restraints and pressed one of the gems. Immediately lightning danced between the restraints and the elf's flesh, her screams echoing in the chamber.</p>
<p>"As I was about to say, before I was so rudely interrupted, is that no external threat or peice of paper will convince me that elven snobbishness will be able to accept dwarven equality. I simply made sure that I was in the position of being the superior before your lot had me in this sort of situation." Gelder explained.</p>
<p>"We would never do something like this to you." I pleaded. "You're far too ugly, we'd have you working the pig farms or something."</p>
<p>Nobody laughed but I could feel Gelder's frustration that I was not as intimidated as she would have hoped.</p>
<p>"Keep running your mouth elf, I have another one of these display pieces set aside just for you." Gelder growled.</p>
<p>"Careful magistrate, you don't want to find yourself facing the elven kingdom alone." I tutted. Gelder closed her eyes and took a deep breath, she needed to change the tone of this conversation.</p>
<p>"Did you know that we keep meticulous records of the captured elves here? Intense interrogations under zones of truth are continuously ongoing. So do you want to know what these 4 elves did to deserve becoming the centrepiece of my office decor?" Gelder asked, regaining her composure.</p>
<p>"No, but I'm sure you're going to tell me anyway." I sighed. Gelder began by walking up to one of the men, aggressively swatting his ass.</p>
<p>"This was the former... mayor? Town leader? I dunno what words you elves use so let's just say my predecessor. He's always part of my collection, I need to make sure he always stays broken. But the other three were moved here especially for you." Gelder explained, making her way to the elf who was so sadistically punished for my joke. "Look closely at this one's face, do you recognise her?"</p>
<p>There was a twinge of recognition in the eyes of this poor girl, but I couldn't quite place it. I'm sure my memory would have been jogged by her hair, were it present.</p>
<p>"Her name is Chantelle. She was visiting Wetforge with her father when we rolled in. In preparation for your visit we checked if anyone would know you and what a surprise it was to find one of your childhood friends amongst our slaves." Gelder informed. I looked away from the elf and all of a sudden a wave of recognition washed over me, quickly followed by a wave of anger. This was not a conflicted and induced rage, impure from being caught out. As the blue mist came over me, it came in white hot and was purely focussed on my hatred for Gelder.</p>

<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>I gritted my teeth and gripped my hands tight as the elven slave simply sobbed. As I listened to her sobs, something didn't sit right with me, but I couldn't focus on it while I was distracted by keeping my rage at bay.</p>
<p>"Is that... where did you learn barbarian ancestral guardianship?" Gelder asked, cutting through my rage to take the discussion in another direction. But my rage did not indulge anything that wasn't the answer to my other questions.</p>
<p>"Who else from my life have you captured?" I screamed in fury.</p>
<p>"Careful ambassador, you don't want to find yourself facing my armies alone." Gelder mockingly tutted. "I'm not in armour right now, if you attack me I'll let you get a few blows in, then all beaten and bloodied, I would have such a claim to take back to my superiors as to why I had to subdue you and your little ambassadorial party."</p>
<p>"Who else?" I repeated, Jodrolim's hand steadying my own from trying to throttle her.</p>
<p>"Nope, I get to move at my own pace here and I want to focus on the oddity of having an elven barbarian in my presence." Gelder asserted through her smirk. "One of my points I used to make was although I had seen many a dwarf learn magic, and I myself often utilise wands of magic provided for me, I had never seen an elf walk the path of a barbarian. This was a reason your kind were both more stuck up and weaker than mine. Yet here you are, I can see now why you have had such success with my contemporaries."</p>
<p>I simply stared angrily at Gelder until she decided I wasn't going to break the silence and moved on to introducing the other slaves.</p>
<p>"Well this gentle-elf here is Chantelle's father, as a former soldier he can handle so much pain without reacting, but lay one finger on his precious daughter and suddenly the waterworks start. So I figured I'd keep them close." Gelder bragged. I thought back to my times visiting the family after school, the warmth their house exuded, the joy their family languished in. Sure it was tempered by a knowledge that childhood nostalgia always paints things more positive and innocent but these people were beloved members of my extended family.</p>
<p>"We did manage to find a soldier who trained with you at the academy, and he was destined to take this last place until at the 11th hour we struck mithril with this slave." Gelder continued as she walked over to the last slave she had on display and lecherously stroked her. "Don't tell me you don't recognise Soliana, your old babysitter?"</p>
<p>I looked into her eyes and saw that same humiliated familiarity I had seen from the other slave. From ages 7 to 11, Soliana looked after me everyday after school. For a long period of my life she was my family, she gave me hugs when I hurt myself, tough love when I didn't want to do my homework, and joy whenever joy could be found. I cried for a week when I found out she couldn't be my babysitter any more as she was moving across the country, I had no idea she was moving to Glimmerlake. Now she sat in this office broken and humiliated, and no amount of Jodrolim's focussing presence could restrain me from launching myself at Gelder.</p>
<p>The dwarf didn't flinch, she simply smiled and held her hands wide awaiting the blow. At the last moment, Jodrolim's will brought me back to my senses and my fist stopped a hair's width in front of her smug grin.</p>
<p>I took a breath and felt a wave of despair wash over me, purging my body of the blue mist that gave me strength until I collapsed at Gelder's feet with tears in my eyes. She condescendingly patted me on the head as she laughed.</p>
<p>"For the next couple of days, you are going to be pampered, you will be treated to the finest hospitality I can conjure up. So while you eat the most luxurious of food and the most elegant perfumed drinks, I want you to remember that every moment you enjoy yourself, I will arrange to have the people you love abused over and over again. They will suffer while you schmooze. And no amount of scintillating conversation or dedicated hobnobbing will do a thing to secure their release."</p>
<p>"If you let them go, I will take their place." I whimpered. They can't endure like I can. I could do this for them. "I will send word to my guard that I volunteered to become a slave so you won't face any backlash, then I will surrender myself to you if you let them go."</p>
<p>"Hmm, no." Gelder mocked. "Why would I give up the chance to watch you suffer in front of everyone? Won't it be agony putting on a brave face, bitterly smiling through the luxuries I present to you. Most importantly, you're going to have to be extra nice to me so I don't take it out on your friends. Then, when your visit is over, I will watch you retreat, tail between your legs, a failure to the people closest to you who now pay your price. Nothing on this earth will be more enjoyable to me."</p>
<p>I stood up, and without another word I left the office, tears streaming down my face as the screams of Gelder's slaves echoed in the hallways behind me.</p>
<p>I returned to the room that had been set aside for me, and began smashing everything in sight, my rage boiling and flowing into pure destruction before falling into a dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>Every moment I spent grinning and layering diplomatic praise on my host, my mind was on the suffering she was causing to people from my past. Despite everything, I had a nagging feeling in my mind that I simply couldn't shake, that there was something important I hadn't noticed in my rage.</p>
<p>I went through every step of the hollow charade with a mind thoroughly elsewhere and I knew that Gelder was loving every moment of my suffering.</p>
<p>"Slave, why is this ale flat?" Gelder suddenly yelled at a nearby elf.</p>
<p>"I don't know, mistress." The elf replied.</p>
<p>"Well where did you get it from?" Gelder yelled.</p>
<p>"I did not fetch that ale for you, mistress." The elf stated. Gelder dipped her finger in her gravy and wiped it on the slave's chest leaving an ugly stain on their already disrespectful outfit.</p>
<p>"Go get the elf responsible for my flat ale or you will be punished in their place." Gelder ordered.</p>
<p>And that was when I realised what was wrong with the situation in the office, what Gelder's big weakness is, and a plan began to form as to how to utilise it.</p>
<p>"Well, it has been a lovely weekend, I will be sad when you leave tomorrow morning." Gelder sighed as we had a final ale of the night in the parlour of the magistrate's mansion, each with one guard by our side just in case.</p>
<p>"It is a shame we did not reach an accord, but I am thankful for your hospitality." I replied, mindful of the watchful eyes of Gelder's guard and Legus Stillstar. I then took a deep breath and prepared my risky plan. "Although I would have thought you would be curious about how I convinced Bhador to release his slaves."</p>
<p>"You know, I hadn't given it much thought. I assumed it was a mixture of your charm, your unique insight into dwarf culture from your barbarian training, and generous offers of recompense." Gelder absentmindedly mused.</p>
<p>"Oh no, it's something far more interesting. I won the slaves' freedom in a bet." I admitted. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Legus Stillstar practically explode with anger while Gelder sat back and chuckled.</p>
<p>"So is this your last minute gambit with me, to try and entice me to take a huge loss over the roll of a dice?" Gelder chuckled. "Honey, that reeks of desperation."</p>
<p>"Then let's indulge my desperation, it certainly has the chance to benefit you. State a fair contest and a forfeit, and I will indulge it for the freedom of just four slaves. You know which four I mean." I suggested.</p>
<p>"Ambassador, don't..." Stillstar tried to interrupt.</p>
<p>"Legus, you do not have a voice in this discussion." I interrupted before turning back to Gelder. "Give me any trial, any ordeal to overcome and I will do it."</p>
<p>"You'd be willing to take any risk over those four? I can imagine freeing just four slaves would be more embarrassing to you than freeing none at all. Alright then, let's make this interesting." Gelder suggested, going to a nearby desk and fetching a quill and some parchment to make everything official and protect her from retaliation based off of my stupidity.</p>
<p>"One point of disagreement we have had over this weekend is my contention that elves are inherently weak, no elf would be able to endure what is required of them if I didn't force them." Gelder monologued. "If you can prove this contention wrong, then you will have earned my respect enough to release 4 of your compatriots."</p>
<p>"Which four..." Legus Stillstar began, only to be interrupted by my glowing blue fist colliding with the wall next to him.</p>
<p>"Aww, ambassador, that's not the way to treat your own kin. Well if you have forgotten your decorum, I'll fill in the gaps for your comrades. On our first night here, I organised reintroductions for the ambassador to a selection of her past personal acquaintances that I currently have in my possession. Suffice to say it has affected her deeply."</p>
<p>"You filthy piece of..." Legus Stillstar began to sneer when I turned to him and shot him a look so severe that he, for the first time since I've known him, lost his will to disagree with me.</p>
<p>"Back to the bet." I growled.</p>
<p>"If you sign this piece of paper, I will take you and personally induct you into our noble cadre of slaves. I will put you through every single degeneration I can. But at any moment, you can admit defeat simply say 'I forfeit' and I will allow you to slink away, free to forever dwell on how your failure left your friends at my mercy. If you make it to the end of the process without forfeiting, I will agree to the proposal you made while in my office, and allow you to trade yourself for your friends." Gelder proposed.</p>
<p>"My friends and the former duke of the area." I clarified.</p>
<p>"He was a duke? Wow, what a peacock. Yes, and the duke." Gelder added, loving the terms being put before her.</p>
<p>"What is the time limit? My induction cannot last indefinitely." I stated.</p>
<p>"Someone's no stranger to loopholes. Very well, at sunrise two days hence your guards are to meet me at the town gate where I will either be handing you over to Legus Stillstar, or I will be handing over the 4 slaves you have freed." Gelder agreed, sliding the agreement in front of me.</p>
<p>"Ambassador, you cannot be seriously..." Legus Stillstar tried to intervene, but was silenced by the sound of my scribbling quill agreeing to Gelder's terms in front of all the witnesses.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid she's not calling the shots anymore." Gelder triumphantly announced as my guardsman watched me exhale a sigh of release, then a boom of raging ancestral energy raged through the room. "Cute, now then, you are wearing far too many clothes right now, remove them."</p>
<p>My hands shook as I began to unbutton my dress, I saw Legus Stillstar look away, and begin to leave in shame.</p>
<p>"Before you go, I need you present while I ask the ambassador a question?" Gelder called out before Legus Stillstar could leave the room. "As he is your guard, that means you are placed above him in the chain of command. Does that mean that he must obey any order you give him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, unless I give him an order that violates elven law." I replied, handing my clothes over to Gelder. I was now standing naked and exposed, the turned back of Legus Stillstar the only thing shielding him from witnessing my disgrace.</p>
<p>"In which case, my new property, I order you to order him to turn around." Gelder commanded.</p>
<p>"Legus Stillstar, please turn around and look at me." I calmly ordered. He gripped his hands by his side so tight I thought his palms were about to bleed. Then he turned around and his face became a picture of shock and disgust.</p>
<p>He stared at my body, he looked me up and down, my stiff nipples, my exposed pussy, my full exposure burned into his retinas. Then when it seemed overwhelming, Gelder decided to twist the knife by wrapping her hand around my neck and drinking in his discomfort as she licked the side of my face.</p>
<p>"It's OK Legus." I reassured. "You have called me unorthodox, improper, and outright questioned my perspective on the world. But in all your logs and reports, do you ever remember calling me weak?"</p>
<p>Our eyes locked and in that moment there was a shared understanding that whatever crazy plan I was working on, I had the strength to endure until it was completed. He looked reassured which infuriated Gelder.</p>
<p>"Aww, that's sweet. Hey soldier boy, take one last look at your boss, there will be nothing left of her when we hand her back, she won't even be herself, just some broken bitch slave." Gelder gloated as she disrespectfully groped my tits at Legus Stillstar.</p>
<p>"Look after yourself." He sighed before walking out of the room, leaving me at Gelder's mercy.</p>
<p>"Alright then my latest bitch, time to begin your orientation. With the slaves like you who are unlucky enough to earn my direct attention, I find the most important thing is that you look the part, makes it easier to break your mind and have you acting the part later. So let's take you to the nearest slave processing centre for alteration." Gelder explained, dragging me by my hair even though I was not putting up any resistance.</p>
<p>She dragged me out of the front door and into the streets of Glimmerlake. Mistreatment of elves was a normal sight on the corrupted streets, but that didn't stop a lot of rubber necks and lingering eyes on the latest casualty to Gelder's designs. Her guards cleared a path as she walked me through the streets and towards a museum that had been repurposed for the slave trade.</p>
<p>"Evening guards, I know it's too late to expect you to process a new slave, so I figured I would do it myself if you would just let me through." Gelder chirped at the two dwarves on the door.</p>
<p>"Magistrate Forgefire, this centre is currently being used to house the ambassador's retinue. Will we need military assistance?" He nervously asked.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, all the elves you lord yourself over will be in there. Completely slipped my mind." Gelder sarcastically mocked. "Nevermind, I'm sure Legus Stillstar has given them all the situation, and if not my new possession can give them pretty much any order I wish. Isn't that right slave?"</p>
<p>"Yes, mistress." I replied, already falling into submissive patterns I observed and practised.</p>
<p>"Someone is already way too on board with what's happening." Gelder joked before having her guard open the doors and lead me into a large room with a lot of smooth clean surfaces. From the room I could hear the general commotion of my retinue on the other side of the wall, their mumbling mundanity unaware of what was happening to their boss right next door.</p>
<p>"In this room, we are going to begin modifying your body, even without your clothes you are still that same stuck-up ambassador who thinks she's better than us, but when I'm done you'll have the body of a sex slave." Gelder threatened, hoping to see my squirm with fear.</p>
<p>Firstly she reached into a drawer and pulled out some forceps that had a hole cut into the arms of them. Gelder clamped them onto my right nipple, then took out a needle and waved it in front of my face.</p>
<p>"All our sex slaves need their nipples pierced, we find it easier to control them if we can pull them around by a chain connected to their tits." Gelder explained, then without warning I felt an explosion of heat through my nipple as she drove the needle through it. Jodrolim's will arose to sooth me through the ordeal, but Gelder ignored it as she methodically pierced my other nipple and attached metal piercings with a length of chain connecting them.</p>
<p>"Did you know, in the olden days we used to have a fireplace roaring in the background of these locations, so unsafe. Do you know why, and why we stopped? Well, it was to heat up the slave brands, but these days you can use gems to enchant metal to do burning damage, so we can get straight to the branding. You have five seconds to forfeit before I leave a permanent mark on your skin that identifies you as my property." Gelder threatened.</p>
<p>I was so thankful for Jodrolim's extreme boost to my ability to overcome pain, as I felt an explosion of red hot agony on my bottom. I bit my bottom lip and swam in my rage to endure until the pain suddenly lessened, the removal of the brand taking away from new heat but not removing the throbbing pain of the scar left behind. I turned around and saw the same brand I had seen earlier, now on me. It was a minimalist representation of a forge with fire bursting out of it, Gelder's crest of ownership. Until the end of my days I will have this mark of dishonour on me.</p>
<p>"Now I would be a terrible sport if I didn't tell you what this does and give you a chance to back out." Gelder mocked, holding an obsidian black razer in front of me. "Could you believe the elves actually used this as a beauty treatment? This is a shaving razor that emanates necrotic damage. So there's no need to pre-cut or lather your hair, the moment this blade touches each strand, necrotic energy follows the hair downwards to your skin, killing the hair follicles at the root. This means that for every hair this blade touches, the hair falls out and never regrows. You guys had it in a spa to use on legs, arms, armpits, all the places us dwarves never saw the shame in growing hair. But if you do not forfeit now, I will be shaving your head and pussy, and they will remain bald until your dying day."</p>
<p>I gritted my teeth and steeled my resolve with Jodrolim's help. If my plan succeeded then a bald head would be a mark of honour for me.</p>
<p>"Also, could you tell your ancestors to calm down? I can barely see with all this swirling ancestral energy." Gelder complained, before I started to feel a cold sizzle of pain in my scalp. I saw my luscious golden hair fluttering to the floor and the creeping necrotic pain confirming that something within my flesh was dying. Soon Gelder was pulling away large clumps of my hair, waving it in my face and mocking me.</p>
<p>"I don't think people realise how big and pointy elf ears are until that area is cleared of hair." Gelder joked as my head began to feel truly and deeply cold. After some intense attention to detail, Gelder confirmed that she was confident every single hair cell on my scalp was now dead. I waited for her to begin shaving my pussy before I reached up and ran my hand over my smooth head and let myself indulge a brief sob of despair while that same cold sizzle began to creep over my pubis.</p>
<p>Once she was done, I shuddered in literal and metaphorical cold. As I did so, Gelder tossed me a small red potion.</p>
<p>"Healing potion." She calmly informed. "Won't undo the alterations I made to you, but it will close the wounds and keep them from getting infected. I don't want my slave all covered in sores and puss."</p>
<p>I was dubious about taking a potion that Gelder had forced upon me, but I couldn't fault her logic and drank from the small bottle, sighing with relief as the lingering pains of her actions faded away. Gelder then pulled up a full length mirror and pulled me by my newly installed nipple chains to stand in front of it and view my new slave's body.</p>
<p>The creature I saw in the mirror was an outright degradation, I had been altered to be more wretched and less refined. All my status now stripped away until only my exposed flesh and abject humiliation remained.</p>
<p>"Now you look far more like the subservient bitch you are." Gelder mocked, before theatrically having an idea. "When you forfeit, I'm going to need to hand you back to your retinue, but they'll be expecting the haughty taughty ambassador, not the slab of slave meat you have become. Just to be on the safe side, we better go show your new visage to them, let them know your new place in the world."</p>
<p>Gelder grabbed my nipple chains and began dragging me towards the door. She pulled me out into the hallway and then unerringly towards the low-level commotion just the other side of the plain door Gelder flung open with reckless abandon.</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>"Hello everyone." She yelled to a darkened room filled with cheap bunk beds. Some eyes turned towards us, there was a moment of struggling recognition, followed by a moment of disbelief, and then a clamouring commotion as the elves gathered their weapons and prepared for a fight.</p>
<p>"That is some admirable devotion, but I think you should order them to stand down before somebody gets hurt." Gelder quipped, for once we were in agreement.</p>
<p>"Stand down everybody." I yelled, surprised that Jodrolim's will also boosted my yelling voice so it was deeper and carried through the echoing room.</p>
<p>"Ambassador, what has she done to you?" A young elf asked in disbelief.</p>
<p>"I'll answer that." Gelder replied before I could get a word out. "We are having a bet right now, your ambassador has submitted herself to two days of slavery in a bid to win the release of slaves from me. So far there has been no treachery, we are all abiding by our parts of the deal. Isn't that right, slave bitch?"</p>
<p>"Yes, mistress." I replied, causing gaps of horror to ripple out throughout my crew.</p>
<p>"I am curious, even in this situation, if you give an order that doesn't violate elven law, they still have to obey it?" Gelder asked with palpable malice.</p>
<p>"Anyone in a military uniform is still bound by their oaths to obey any order I give that does not violate elven law, mistress." I obediently replied.</p>
<p>"Alright then, if you make eye contact with any elf, you are to order them to slap you in the face, is that clear?" Gelder ordered.</p>
<p>"Yes, mistress." I obeyed. I looked up at the sea of shock and anguish, and immediately regretted it, partially for the intense shame of my fall from grace, but also because I immediately made eye contact with the young elf who first spoke up for me. "Private Gildleaf, I order you to slap me in the face."</p>
<p>The private looked around for support, but every one of his colleagues resigned themselves that he had no choice but to obey a direct order.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry." He sighed, before whipping his hand across my face. I growled with the explosion of force and danced with Jodrolim's will. Until Gelder whispered something in my ear, further instructions that I was to obey, but that she wanted to be spontaneous for those watching.</p>
<p>"Private Gildleaf, I am insulted by your apology. You do not apologise for following orders, understood? Now I am going to order you to slap me again, but before you do so, you are to call me a stupid bitch and tell me I deserve it." I instructed, recalling Gelder's words verbatim. For what it was worth, the young soldier had a tear running down his face as he psyched himself up to tell me off.</p>
<p>"You are a stupid bitch and you deserve this." He nervously stuttered, before once again slapping me across the face. In the silent shame of my retinue, the sound of his slap echoed through the hall.</p>
<p>"This is some sort of dwarven trick and I won't play along." A larger and more angry elf exclaimed, grabbing a halberd and holding it threateningly. "Let the ambassador go."</p>
<p>"OK." Gelder sighed, letting go of my chain. "But you better talk to him because if your not back in my possession soon, I'm going to count this as losing the bet."</p>
<p>"Sergeant Moonshadow..." I began.</p>
<p>"God, all your names are so annoying." Gelder interrupted, before gesturing me to proceed.</p>
<p>"Sergeant Moonshadow. I have made my agreement. To contravene that is to lose all hope of freeing our enslaved brethren. I know that this is hard to watch, believe me it is hard to endure, but I am willing to do whatever it takes to free the slaves and I need your support in that." I explained, before walking back to my mistress's side and placing the chain between my nipples in her hands.</p>
<p>"That was touching. I admire this guy, not his stupid name, but his spirit. Hey, how about you order him to fuck you?" Gelder posited.</p>
<p>"Sorry mistress, but sexual relationships with elves in your chain of command is against elven law, I cannot give him such an order." I informed Gelder, which took the wind out of her sails a bit.</p>
<p>"Alright then, let's just stick with abuse." Gelder giggled, whispering my next order in my ear, thrilling that my unit would hear these orders from my mouth and not hers.</p>
<p>"Sergeant Moonshadow, your actions dishonour our host, so I will be paying the debt of honour on your behalf, but you will assist me. First you are to call me a dishonourable cunt, then you are to slap my slutty tits, my mistress expects to see each boob jiggle twice in response to your abuse. Then you are to take up my nipple chain and drag me back to my mistress, handing back ownership of my body. This is all an order." I informed the Sergeant as he squirmed uncomfortably. He stared into my eyes, wordlessly pleading for me to join him in fighting against this humiliating situation. "As you just made eye contact, I also order you to slap me in the face."</p>
<p>"You dishonourable cunt." He quickly growled, then continuing the trend of trying to get this over and done with as quickly as possible, he unleashed a volley of slaps, the first one striking my face, then switching between his left and right hands to efficiently slap my tits around as per my deviant instructions. Once finished, he grabbed my chain, then looked very intently at the ceiling as he dragged me back to my mistress.</p>
<p>"They are obedient aren't they?" Gelder gushed. "And now they all know what a fallen piece of slut meat their boss has become, I don't think I have a use for them any more. Order them to retreat to the outskirts of town, leaving you behind at my mercy."</p>
<p>"Yes, mistress." I confirmed to Gelder before turning to my unit, their image of me now permanently destroyed by my actions. "Soldiers, retreat. Leave me behind."</p>
<p>There was a quiet rumble of preparations as my guards packed their stuff and left. Some were crying with sadness at their apparent betrayal, others with faces like thunder, Legus Stillstar was holding himself together remarkable well and kept the professionalism that allowed for such an orderly retreat.</p>
<p>"Ha, now that was fun!" Gelder exclaimed as the door swung shut after the last guard. "But boy is it late and you have a full day tomorrow, so let's take you to your sleeping arrangements."</p>
<p>I was dragged by my nipple chain out of the slave quarters and back towards the magistrate's mansion.</p>
<p>"You know, you must tell me what kind of life you lived that instead of becoming a cowardly archer or wimpy spellslinger, you ended up on a noble dwarvish path of barbarianism." Gelder absentmindedly wondered as she once again dragged me through the streets. "It's crazy to think we both are the same class of fighter."</p>
<p>"I picked it up when I served side by side with dwarves in the war, mistress." I replied.</p>
<p>"Ancestral guardianship was an interesting choice. How do you think your kin beyond the veil feel about the slave slut you've become?"</p>
<p>"It is their will I channel, not their being, so they aren't aware of what is happening. Otherwise I don't think I would be able to handle the shame, mistress." I unguardedly replied. I had never thought about how Jodrolim would feel seeing me this way. I would hope that through his sadness he would at least knew me well enough to trust I had a plan.</p>
<p>We arrived at the mansion, Gelder immediately took me through the house and out of the back doors. The back garden was once a highly maintained elegant elven garden, it was now overgrowing and patchy where some non-native species had died while others had thrived. At the back of the garden was a series of kennels, where hunting dogs used to be kept by the Duke, now all but four of the kennels were empty, the slaves I was first taunted with now lay in crude dog beds. There was a small commotion when I arrived, my friends weeped to see me in such a state, knowing moreso than me what this all entailed.</p>
<p>Gelder wrote my name in chalk on the price of black slate above a vacant kennel before wordlessly throwing me in. She then mockingly wished me a good night, before leaving me alone with my fellow slaves.</p>
<p>"Fucking hell." Soliana exclaimed, the first to break the tense silence. "She got to you too?"</p>
<p>"Something like that, but don't worry about me." I quickly replied. "This is part of my plan to get you all free. How have you been?"</p>
<p>"I can't say it's been ideal, but while her focus has been on you she hasn't been doing much to us." Chantelle's father replied. "I don't know why she has such a grudge against you."</p>
<p>"She has a grudge against what I stand for, that's why I knew she would rise to my bait." I reassured.</p>
<p>"I hope you don't trust her to keep her end of any bargain you made." The duke cautioned.</p>
<p>"No, I don't. Which is why I know my plan will work."</p>
<p>It was a cold night, every so often I would feel a shiver wash over my skin and every time I would feel Jodrolim beside me, giving me strength to endure.</p>
<p>I managed to get some uneasy sleep, but it had no depth, so when I heard Gelder's approaching footsteps I awoke and readied myself for a day or torment.</p>
<p>"Morning slaves!" Gelder chirped as she began to unlock all the kennels. She was wearing a nightdress and it was a strange sight considering so far I'd only seen her in military regalia. "It looks like it's going to be a great day. So, as my other slaves can attest, I usually like to kick off my morning by being eaten out. Would the former ambassador like to do the honours?"</p>
<p>At first I thought this was a rhetorical question, but it hung in the air as she stared intently at my kennel and I realised she was awaiting a reply.</p>
<p>"Yes, mistress." I replied and Gelder smiled, unlocking my kennel. As I uneasily crawled out, she kicked me over so I fell onto my back. Then, taking advantage of me lying prone, she stepped above me so she was straddling me. I could now see there was no underwear under her nightdress, and her hairy pussy was slowly lowering itself down towards my face.</p>
<p>I didn't move as I felt Gelder's labia brush against my nose, readjust, and then fall hard onto my mouth, squirming and rubbing against me.</p>
<p>"Come on bitch, start licking." Gelder instructed and to drive home her point she started slapping my breasts until I relented and allowed my tongue to begin lapping inside of her. "Oh yeah, that's the stuff. Hey other slaves, your former friends is lapping up my pussy right now, hope that makes you all feel miserable."</p>
<p>I had never engaged in oral sex on a woman before, so I was just muddling through as best as I could, allowing my tongue to roam, trying to ignore the unusual taste while also feeling Gelder's coarse pubic hair rubbing around my face. Gelder had decided that the best thing to do while I was subjected to this was to assault my body with slaps.</p>
<p>"Hey, this bitches friends, um... the two girls. Come here." Gelder ordered. "I want to really start slapping this bitch's pussy. Hold her legs open for me."</p>
<p>There was a pause before I indeed felt a hand on each of my ankles, pulling my legs apart. Then when they were at their widest, I felt an explosive impact directly on my pussy. I growled and Jodrolim's spirit flowed through me. I felt strength flow to my legs as I forced them closed, the sound of Soliana and Chantelle being thrown by my augmented strength. Gelder just laughed until I felt her laugh merge with her moans of delight as her pussy spasmed and she squirted on my face.</p>
<p>She stood up and laughed at my disgraceful situation before dragging me inside the mansion by my nipple chain, leaving the other slaves outside to the mercy of the guards.</p>
<p>In the dining room a fancy breakfast had been prepared for Gelder, and she made me sit on the floor by her side as she wolfed it down. Once she was satisfied, she took the remaining scraps off of her plate and threw it on the floor next to me.</p>
<p>"There you go, eat up." She ordered, so I gingerly picked up a crust of bread. However, just before I put it in my mouth, Gelder took out a wand and pointed it at me, activating the magic within then laughing at my confusion as nothing seemed different. I took a bite of the bread and immediately recoiled at the taste that hit my mouth.</p>
<p>"Aww, is my poor slave confused." Gelder laughed. "This is a wand of minor illusion with a slight twist. Instead of affecting a target's sight or hearing, it affects your taste. So for one minute at a time, everything you eat will taste like my pussy juices, and I plan to use this on you every time I feed you."</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and prepared to eat the pussy flavoured food, knowing I would need my strength for the day ahead. With each bite I took, my tastebuds confused me, the varied textures meeting with the singular taste was an unusual sensation that heightened to assault on my palate. Soon the scraps were cleared up and Gelder's laughter began to fade.</p>
<p>"I looked everywhere for a wand that could make that effect permanent, but sadly the magic isn't there yet. I'm sure if I ever do find it, my pussy is going to be the only thing your friends will taste forevermore." She mocked, pulling me to my feet and dragging me towards the secret office. "God why must Spellcasters be so inconsistent, your kind's reliance on them is a weakness. Surely you agree our strength is raw and unbound, a far more respectable way to impose your will."</p>
<p>I simply paused and waited to hear what Gelder wanted to do next.</p>
<p>"Now I checked with some scientists a while ago and unfortunately, they say dwarves and elves cannot interbreed. Such a shame that they would shit on my dream to have my guards put a little dwarf bastard in your uterus to take away with you. But science isn't always absolutely certain, so how about we use you to make absolutely sure elves can't get pregnant from a dwarf."</p>
<p>Gelder opened the door to her secret underground office, and I was immediately confronted with a room filled with dwarves. None of them were wearing clothes and they were all looking at me with a mixture of anger and lust while they stroked their cocks.</p>
<p>"Now I am still the magistrate of Wetforge so I have some official duties to take care of, but I'll be back to pick you up at lunchtime. Remember everyone, the first one to get her to say 'I forfeit' gets a free personal slave." Gelder mocked, closing the door behind her, leaving me alone in the room filled with malicious lust.</p>
<p>There was a single beat of hesitation while emotions swirled before the largest dwarf stepped forward and punched me in the stomach. I found myself bent double by the blow, Jodrolim soothing as best as he could as I saw the dwarf's cock right in my face. He wrapped his hand around the back of my head, and I knew I was in big trouble if I didn't open wide.</p>
<p>His cock was relentless, it went straight down my throat and immediately began ravaging my neck. My world was reduced to Jodrolim's will keeping my pussy breakfast down, and the rapid bouncing of the dwarf's navel against my forehead. At least that was until I felt another cock pressing against my pussy.</p>
<p>Soon my body was simply a ragdoll being tossed between the cock on my mouth and the cock up my pussy. I had no agency, only the will to endure the violation. There was some commotion as the first dwarf took his cock out of my mouth, unbalancing me so I fell forward and the other dwarf's cock fell out of me. The biggest dwarf ignored his complaints as he was busy jerking himself so that his seed would splash on my face. As it did so, the other dwarf found a new angle to once again fuck my pussy.</p>
<p>"Ready to forfeit yet, elf?" The dwarf barked at me as his cum hit me square in the face. He lifted my chin so he was looking directly in my eyes and saw that I still had a stern look of resolve. He resignedly slapped me across the face, then stepped to one side so the next erect cock could move into his place.</p>
<p>For some reason, I decided that counting the loads of cum pumped inside of me would help keep me sane, or at least some form of it. As the next man began assaulting my throat, I felt the sticky mess surging in my pussy, and in my mind I acknowledged '1 in my face, 1 in my pussy.'</p>
<p>It was by the time I had 3 in my face and 5 in my pussy that the whirlwind of violation paused for a moment at the suggestion of one of the dwarves.</p>
<p>"We're supposed to be getting her to forfeit, so we need to step it up." He acknowledged.</p>
<p>"What you thinking of?" the dwarf whose cock was in my mouth asked.</p>
<p>"If one of us lies on the floor and we force her down onto the cock, another of us can violate that tight little sphincter of hers." He suggested, and the room grunted various noises of approval.</p>
<p>I was brutally pulled off the cocks currently penetrating me so I could be moved into position. My mind was already blank with the mixture of pleasure and pain so I just limply obeyed the instructions their forceful hands gave me. Soon I was being lowered onto a cock and I felt it go deep inside me. I was pushed forwards so I was leaning on the dwarf's chest and could once again go back to having another dwarf's cock in my mouth. That's when I felt some relentless pressure against my ass.</p>
<p>There were some painful attempts to use brute force to thrust in a cock, but he was large, dry, and trying to enter an anus that had never been entered before. Each time he tried, it was to no avail until he relented and agreed he needed to lube himself up.</p>
<p>In the corner of the room was all the cleaning supplies needed, including some soft tallow soap for sweaty dwarven bodies. My future violator smeared a generous amount onto his erect cock, and this time no amount of clenching could keep him from sliding his dick into my ass.</p>
<p>Jodrolim's spirit roared to give me the fortitude needed to endure such an assault. The explosion of hot pain from my anus would have been far too much without his help beyond the grave. But through his comfort and constitution, I was able to endure the relentless ravaging of my pussy and ass at the same time.</p>
<p>I was a sticky mess, my mind unable to grasp any thoughts but the running count of my bespoiling. Every time a dwarf came in my pussy we had a bit of an awkward shuffle to get another one in place, but other than that it was simply constant full body fucking without end.</p>
<p>By my count, it was 9 in my face, 13 in my pussy, and 6 in my ass when Gelder came to fetch me. I was covered in sticky dwarf cum with more dripping from my ravaged holes. There was a red hot soreness that only relented at the surges of Jodrolim's will as Gelder appreciated her dwarves' handiwork.</p>
<p>"Now this is what you were born to be. Not some snotty ambassador, a cum saturated slave whore. It's a shame you're not going to win the bet because of you did I would love to leave you in my military barracks for the week, see if you can be fucked by every dwarf in my army." Gelder mockingly laughed, although I was far too out of it to take her words to heart.</p>
<p>Gelder thanked the dwarves for doing their part before once again grabbing my chain and dragging me to her own ideas. Once again she ate lunch with me by her side before feeding me the scraps, this time enchanted to taste like her piss. Then she dragged me out of the magistrate's mansion and once again into the streets of Wetforge.</p>
<p>I had become numb to the stares my humiliation drew, the sun shining on my total exposure no longer seemed to throw me, Jodrolim's spirit retreated back to the netherworld and I was left with the dull ache of past violations accompanying me each step of my journey.</p>
<p>We didn't walk far until we came to a blacksmith's, the roar of the forge prickling my skin with heat. Next to the forge I saw a chest full of my effects and I realised what Gelder was planning next.</p>
<p>"I realised you had nobody to carry your things when we're done with this, so I thought I would help you lighten the load." She smugly suggested. "Let's start with the obvious, throw any and all clothes you own into the fire."</p>

<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>I opened the chest and immediately started burning my clothes. All my ambassadorial outfits, my supportive underwear. Everything I would wear to cloak my slutty body with civility was discarded into the fire.</p>
<p>Soon all that was left were the objects and trinkets that I kept for personal reasons. My medals from the war, my diamond dewdrop, the necklace Jodrolim had somehow managed to source in a war camp just to give to me as an anniversary present. Then there were the pieces of parchment that defined my life, my ambassadorial letter of safe conduct, my letters from mum and dad, and even my qualifications and confirmation of military rank.</p>
<p>All of it dumped into a messy pile on the dusty floor.</p>
<p>"Alright bitch, that whole pile seems important, that seems like a lot of things from back before you were a mindless whore. So how about you show your former life the contempt it deserves. Piss on it, piss on it all." Gelder ordered.</p>
<p>She shuffled me until I was squatting above the collection of things most valuable to me. I squeezed my eyes tight, and tried to pee, but none was coming out.</p>
<p>"Come on bitch, piss on your life." Gelder continued to order, but to no avail. "Fine, let's do this the hard way."</p>
<p>Gelder took out a wand and held it aloft to activate it.</p>
<p>"Piss." She ordered and I felt the familiar pull of the command spell taking ahold of my body. My muscles spasmed against their will and soon I felt a trickle of urine leave my body and start drizzling onto the collection of valuable items beneath me. The command spell seemed to endure forever, until I was certain every drop of pee within me had just been expelled onto my valuables.</p>
<p>"That's good, give them what they deserve. Now, place your hands behind your back, you are to pick up your pissed stained possessions with your mouth and throw them into the forge." Gelder explained. She looked at me expectantly, hoping this was the weakness she had seized on before to get me to forfeit. Instead I picked up the medal of valour I got the day Jodrolim died, now tasting as bitter as it made me feel, and inelegantly tossed it into the forge like a dog tossing around its prey. Deep down I hoped this forge could succeed where others had failed and fit destroy that fucking medal.</p>
<p>I furious mania overcame me as I continued to toss my piss soaked possessions into the forge. Each time I picked up something I disgusted both in the taste of the item, and the civilised life it once represented. I was thrilled to destroy the diamond dewdrop and my letter of safe passage, Jodrolim's will only growing at their demise. I wasn't even slowed by throwing out Jodrolim's necklace, the modest keepsake insignificant compared to his actual presence within me.</p>
<p>I threw the final letter from mum and dad into the forge, then turned to Gelder, satisfied that she was not happy with my lack of suffering.</p>
<p>"I see from your shit-eating grin that you think you've gotten in the flow of things. That you can endure everything because I've been taking it easy on you. Well how about we go to the main event shall we?" Gelder snarled as she once again grabbed my nipple chain to drag me to my next debasement.</p>
<p>This time I was dragged towards a building site, the plethora of dwarven masters barely batting an eyelid on my degraded form as they had a job to do keeping the elf slaves building. As we passed through the building site it became clear that Gelder was converting the old Glimmerlake theatre into an ampithetre, with high walls to prevent the escape of those forced to become part of the show. It was still very much unfinished, but that didn't stop Gelder from placing me in the centre, then issuing instructions that she wanted the stadium filled with as many as possible, elf slaves and dwarf masters, all were invited. As the stadium filled up, Gelder kept herself busy making devious arrangements I was not privvy to.</p>
<p>Within the hour I sat naked and exposed in front of thousands as Gelder called for quiet.</p>
<p>"Good afternoon everyone, our show today begins with a question to the elves, does anyone recognise this wretched pile of elf meat?" Gelder asked, pausing for effect. "This whore was the ambassador sent to negotiate freedom for the elves. This degraded filth represents any chance you elves have of breathing free air again. Now you are going to sit and watch as I take your champion and bring her lower than she ever thought she would be. While you watch her status get thoroughly destroyed, I want her to watch the hope die in your eyes."</p>
<p>Gelder took out the wand of command that she had used on me earlier, brandishing it with a malevolant grin.</p>
<p>"So, to start off, because of your horny body and subservient nature, you have failed all these elves who looked to you for salvation." Gelder contextualised before pointing the wand of command at me. "Apologise."</p>
<p>Wills battles within me, Jodrolim's spirit fighting to keep me strong against the magical invasion of Gelder's malice. Jodrolim could indeed fortify me, but he could not dictate my actions and soon the spell conquered my mind and I began to spout my humiliating apology.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry everyone, my slutty submissive nature means that instead of freeing you, I chose to become a slave myself. I beg your forgiveness even though I do not deserve it." I called to the crowd as gasps and murmers filled the air. Worse still, just as Gelder had hoped, I saw my fellow elves becoming filled with disgust and despair for the whole situation.</p>
<p>After a moment that seemed to last forever, Gelder walked up behind me and swept my legs out so I fell backwards to the ground. She loomed over me and once again pointed the wand of command at me.</p>
<p>"Stay." She commanded, and my body went rigid with obedience. Then, in front of the whole audience, Gelder pulled down her studded leather armoured trousers and squatted directly above me. "All of you remember, this is your place now!"</p>
<p>No sooner had the last word left Gelder's mouth than a torrent of piss rained down on me. At first it hit my chest and neck, but Gelder saw that and readjusted herself to ensure she was hitting me straight in the face. I wanted to block, shield myself from the disgusting dirty onslaught, but the command held me still and I endured the shower of indignity until the last drop.</p>
<p>"You realise you can forfeit at any time." Gelder informed. "Remember those words, I forfeit, you'll certainly need them for what comes next."</p>
<p>With a lot of fanfare, Gelder walked over to a cage in the corner of the amphitheatre. She stood back, carefully undoing the latch with her fingertips before diving out of the way to safety as the door swung open. Inside the cage was a moderately sized sofa.</p>
<p>The air of anticlimax in the audience was palpable.</p>
<p>Then Gelder took out another wand, this one far grander and more expensive than the wand of command. It was filled with gemstones and pulsing with magic. Gelder pointed it at the sofa, and the arcane spell murmur revealed to me what spell she was casting. Dominate Beast.</p>
<p>Gelder's eyes began to glow blue and her body went slack, as if her mind were no longer present. Instead the sofa cushions shifted to reveal a wide toothy grin, as the mimic shifted its shape and began to emerge from the cage. Its mouth morphed into something capable of speaking corrupted words that were echoed from Gelder's mouth.</p>
<p>"Oh the possibilities of violation I now have." The creature squelched. It melted and reformed into various threatening shapes, a feral dog with a barbed erection, a pulsating monster with probing tentacles, a huge slimy slug leaving a trail of ooze behind it. Each one menacingly looking down upon me.</p>
<p>The mimic briefly changed vaguely humanoid, but that was just to walk over to Gelder's vacant body and pick up the wand of command.</p>
<p>"This wand has 5 charges left in it." The mimic drooled as it once again burst with possibilities. "And I am going to use every one on the same command. Five different monsters will look at you with unbridled lust, and in front of everyone here, they will order you to submit."</p>
<p>The mimic settled on the first form, it was a gigantic filthy hog, it squealed with feral lust at my body before it. I looked back at it with horror, I was about to become a sow, a bestial whore, pig semen was going to overflow out of my pussy and the thought of it overwhelmed me until I felt all anger replaced with terror and Jodrolim's spirit evaporated.</p>
<p>"Stop, I forfeit." I screamed in terror. The looming pig laughed in triumph and I was left to face the scale of my humiliation. With tears in my eyes I stood up and began to make my way back to Gelder's body, instead the mimic pig headbutted me to the ground.</p>
<p>"Unlike you stupid elves, I think through the agreements I make. We agreed that if you forfeit, you get handed back to your guard tomorrow. We never said you stopped being my slave before then." Gelder mockingly laughed through the mimic's pig mouth. With great difficulty she maneuvered a trotter that had the wand of command in it until it was pointing at me.</p>
<p>"Submit." It commanded.</p>
<p>My face was the picture of fury and Jodrolim was raging around me as Gelder triumphantly threw me into a kennel that evening. Satisfied at not only winning the bet, but also in breaking my spirit with a big show of unspeakable violation.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow I am going to have so much fun handing you back an abject failure. Say your goodbyes to your friends, maybe apologise that your weakness has condemned them to a life of misery." Gelder mocked as she walked away.</p>
<p>I waited for her to disappear back inside before taking a deep breath, and allowing Jodrolim to return to rest. It was time to do the most risky part of my plan.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about us Nyana, we'll be..." Soliana tried to console, only to be interrupted by the sound of my lock falling from my kennel.</p>
<p>"No, it is me who needs to reassure you not to worry." I informed as I climbed out of my cage. "Gelder is prejudiced as hell, she has made a lot of assumptions about me and us, and now it is time for us to take advantage of that."</p>
<p>My nerves were prickling with trepidation. I had been planning this since I made the crucial observations about Gelder upon which this whole plan depended.</p>
<p>"Firstly, she assumed that as I have barbarian abilities, like her, I didn't know any spells and would need to rely on wands. So she doesn't know about my reduction spell, which I just used to unlock the kennels. She has also assumed I have no reason to try and escape so didn't leave any guards." I explained as I walked over to Chantelle's kennel and unlocked it, helping my childhood friend to her feet.</p>
<p>"The other thing I noticed is that she cannot tell elves apart, especially after she has shaved them. When I was in the office, she introduced you as Soliana and Soliana as you. Then, when she was shouting at a servant, she made a point of leaving a mark on her outfit so she would later know who to punish later." I explained, leading Chantelle to my kennel. "So tomorrow, when she comes to fetch me to release me, she will be releasing you instead."</p>
<p>"No, I can't abandon..." Chantelle began.</p>
<p>"This is not about abandoning anyone. What do you think happens tomorrow, about ten minutes after you leave with my retinue? Legus Stillstar gets to accuse Gelder of doing a switcheroo to break our agreement and kidnap me. The terms of my visit were clear and severe about the scale of a diplomatic fuckup if she enslaved me or any of my party. Everyone knows how much she loves to enslave high status elves, that protection the dwarven kingdom has extended to her would not survive such a break in our agreement."</p>
<p>We took our places in our newly swapped kennels and I hoped.</p>
<p>That morning Gelder came and removed Chantelle, mocking her the whole time.</p>
<p>"I see your tongue is still frozen by your loss, very good, I hated your stupid voice anyway." Gelder observed as Chantelle continued my vow of broken silence.</p>
<p>About ten minutes after Chantelle was dragged away, myself, Soliana, and Chantelle's dad were removed from the kennels by the guards and dragged back to a housing area for slaves. After we arrived, we put on some rags, awaited an assignment, and more importantly, let as many other slaves as possible in on my plan.</p>
<p>After a day shovelling sludge and a night sleeping in the workhouse, I was awakened when Gelder stormed in looking like every elf in the kingdom had pissed on her face.</p>
<p>"Which of you fucking bitches is that ambassador cunt!" She screamed with unbelievable fury, pulsing red veins showing her barbarian rage for the first time since I met her. The whole housing area fell silent and I took some deep breaths to keep Jodrolim's blue mist from exposing me. "You sneaky elven fucks. Fine. Guards, bring every female elf with a shaved head into the next room."</p>
<p>Gelder stormed into the next room and the guards began separating and rounding up the slaves according to her instructions.</p>
<p>"Why are so many of you bitches cueballs? I only permanently shaved a handful of you." Gelder yelled as she saw the crowd of bald elves looking at her. She didn't know that among the crowd I found an elf who used to work at a healing temple and another that knew fire magic, between them they had singed off the hair then magically healed the scalps of an impressive number of volunteers.</p>
<p>"Right, all you bitches strip." She ordered. We all mutely obeyed and soon she was looking at a sea of exposed elven flesh, which despite everything made her ashamed and us proud.</p>
<p>Gelder stalked the room, studying each body in turn, at one point her eyes roamed over me, and I gritted my teeth and acted as scared as I could. I worried that any sign of defiance could clue her in to who she was looking at.</p>
<p>"Magistrate Gelder." One of her guards interrupted.</p>
<p>"Not right now, nothing is more important to me than finding that bitch." Gelder yelled. The guard showed a piece of paper to a couple of other guards at the door, then interrupted her again.</p>
<p>"Former Magistrate Gelder." He announced. She was only a few rows away from me, I got to see her face drop as she realised what had just happened.</p>
<p>"You fucking cunts, you can't do this..." Gelder began, but her anger was suddenly interrupted by guards moving to subdue her. It wasn't pretty, a few of the guards were left with lifelong scars, but soon a bloodied and beaten Gelder was locked in manacles and removed.</p>
<p>We waited about an hour in silence before the sudden influx of elven soldiers handing out cloaks and escorting us to the exit confirmed my mission had been a success. I wrapped myself with a cloak and filtered out with my brethren.</p>
<p>As the mass of slaves walked the streets, I was singled out for praise and assistance by those with whom I had been scheming, and eventually I was able to find Legus Stillstar. He recognised me pretty much immediately and his face lit up as he swum through the crowd.</p>
<p>"I hoped to find you promptly, Ambassador Springdew." He gushed, pulling me out of the crowd and rushing me ahead to the front of the movement. "We talked it over and decided that is would be most appropriate for you to throw open the gates of Glimmerlake and release the slaves to freedom."</p>
<p>Even though I had questions on questions, everyone the Legus had talked to was so on board with this plan they had no time for anything but rushing me to the front of the crowd, they knew nobody was going to wait to leave just to indulge symbolism. They were just in time, I reached the front of the movement about a hundred metres ahead of the gates. Then everyone stepped back to let me have my moment.</p>
<p>As I stood alone, all eyes on me, I knew the contradiction of the moment. This was to be my moment of glory, of triumph and exhilaration, but to have those I would have to face it alone. If I wanted to share the crowning moment of my life with the one whose love transcended death, I would have to dig down and find some righteous fury.</p>
<p>I dropped my cloak, I tempered my elation with the knowledge of the pain that stood behind me, and all the suffering that still stood ahead of me. I felt shameful anger that despite everything, I was so broken that I would continue to feel a thrill at the very treatment that will keep these poor souls from a restful night's sleep until their dying days. Everyone watched me bare and humiliated, the elf who secured their freedom as an ambassador and as a slave. Around me erupted into blue flames that outshone even the early morning sun.</p>
<p>"Freedom" I screamed, my lungs and Jodrolim's carrying my message far and wide, my arms and Jodrolim's arms flinging open the gates. My heart and Jodrolim's heart thundering in my chest as a cry of freedom rose up behind me.</p>
<p>Another parade, a new slutty dress everyone claims is elegant, a wig from a wigmaker who was heartwarmingly happy to finally have a client who didn't mind them taking credit for my hair. Now I stood on a balcony overlooking a crowd, all of whom marvelling at the recently revealed grand mural of me standing in my naked slave form, a beam of light illuminating my skin as I led our people out of the darkness. There was a little fizz in my stomach at the thought of my degraded body being immortalised in such a way.</p>
<p>At the debrief I was told how successful my plan had been. Legus Stillstar very quickly figured out what I was up to when he locked eyes on Chantelle. He quietly took her and then waited until they were back in elven territory to 'notice the switch,' blaming Gelder's modifications and Chantelle's traumatised silence for why it took so long for the truth to come to light. The story that was then sold to the public still was that my reputation as a chainbreaker made Gelder scared enough that she had to deal with me, but my iron resolve weathered the storm while I awaited my rescue.</p>
<p>The Dwarven kingdom were evasive about what happened to Gelder. It was clear that she had been removed from her post and there were rumours she had been imprisoned somewhere she couldn't cause any trouble. I made a note to track her down again some day, just to re-engage on equal terms again.</p>
<p>Legus Stillstar managed to act like a diplomat, making sure there was appropriate outrage at the disgraceful betrayal of an elven hero, the suggestion that Gelder always planned to use our bet as a cover for this, and pressuring the growing frustrations within the dwarven kingdom that Gelder's open animosity was putting the alliance at risk. Eventually the dwarven kingdom relented to the raw fury and threats of invasion and came to an agreement that Glimmerlake become shared territory and all slaves freed. There was originally a suggestion that I would become the magistrate but I turned it down, I haven't finished plumbing the depths of my deviancy yet and the road beckons.</p>
<p>So instead I had to stand here and wave for the people I freed, before my private meeting with Prince Sylvir to discuss what miracle I had planned next.</p>
<p>At the reception I kept my mind clear, I didn't have any alcohol and a few select appetisers being passed around. Naturally everyone wanted to talk to me and get in my good graces, the first elf to earn two diamond dewdrops. At the ceremony I was not only presented with a new one, but my old one had been retrieved from the forge (it had even higher magical protections than that fucking medal that still sat among my effects.) When handed both the dewdrops, I realised that their pins were fine enough to thread them through my newly pierced nipples, and I knew that would be their new home very soon.</p>
<p>Then at the end of the night, I was informed that my requested audience with the prince was to be held in an extravagant drawing room cleared for the purpose. I took a deep breath and prepared for my next plan.</p>
<p>"Ah the ambassadorial genius. I see your wig has somehow become lost in the party, no matter, I can have another sent for before we begin our discussions." The prince announced, filled with levity and glowing praise.</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>I thought about the mission I had given myself, the feeling of anger I felt as I flung open the gates and steeled my nerves for what was to come.</p>
<p>"Actually, your majesty. I deliberately removed my wig in advance of this meeting. In fact, now that we are alone I can fully transform myself to a form ready to make the point I wish to make." I once again felt Jodrolim's will bubbling within me as I unclasped my slinky dress and allowed it to drop to my feet. I unclipped my unorthodox necklace to reveal it was actually my slave chain, fastened behind my neck by the piercinf bars I was now threading through my nipples. I now stood in front of my prince naked, shaved, and disgraced. I had become the slave I once was.</p>
<p>"I've had a lot of time to reflect on my dealings with the dwarves, on the negotiations for people's lives that I conducted in smiling dining rooms over elegant meals, and one thing really struck me. In all our negotiations, all any dwarf cared about was replacing the elven slaves they lost. Not one of them spoke on behalf of the dwarven slaves they must have known that we have." I explained to the abjectly stunned royal. "By your reckoning, how many dwarven slaves do we have?"</p>
<p>The prince took a moment to regain his composure and think through my question while I stood before him without shame despite my degraded display. I had thought about how Jodrolim had given his strength to mine to secure the freedom of my brethren, and now I would put myself on the line to free his, two halves of the same fight.</p>
<p>"By... by my estimate, we have two... no three mining towns each with a thousand or so dwarves. I guess... maybe a few coastal villages who need maritime workers, oh... also there will be some farming towns in need of brute force. Altogether I... I would put the figure at four... maybe five thousand." He calculated, his smooth presentation long forgotten in the presence of my naked body.</p>
<p>"Is it making you uncomfortable seeing me like this?" I quipped, approaching the prince so my degraded body would fill his vision. "Is the sight of a hero of the realm, now absolutely stripped of all respectability, something unpalatable to you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you've made your point, you are using your own body to confront me with the realities of slavery, I get that. Are you going to be stripping down on behalf of the slaves we captured in our war with man as well?" The prince asked, throwing me for a moment.</p>
<p>"Deep down, I know one day I'll have to deal with my issues, and one of them is my fury at what men took from me. I can't fight for them yet, but I am hopeful that one day I will." I reasoned.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess I'll have to prepare for that. As for the dwarves, I can't just give a blanket order to free the slaves across all territories, there would be a huge backlash." The prince stammered.</p>
<p>"Then I guess I know what my next mission is. Give me a list of every elven territory where dwarves are kept as slaves and I will visit them one at a time. I'm sure I can be very persuasive."</p>
