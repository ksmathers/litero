<p>Once again, I sat down to write a short one-shot and ended up going waaaaaayyyyyy overboard. Hope you enjoy my (over)exertion.</p>
<p>As always, all participants are over the age of 18.</p>
<p>"Dylan, come here."</p>
<p>My older sister, Lucy, was lying on the floor of her bedroom. She was on her stomach, wearing only a t-shirt and panties. She had a pillow under her groin, folded at the corner. She held herself in a backwards arch, like doing a cobra pose in yoga. Her body trembled with effort. Her cute, round face was cherry red. Her light blue eyes glazed over and oddly empty.</p>
<p>I'd been lost in my own world, walking down the hall, when Lucy called out to me. It was a hot day, summer was just getting started, and I was already suffering under the sad reality that our new house didn't have air conditioning. My minimal outfit of a t-shirt and mesh shorts felt like a full, fur coat.</p>
<p>"You should. Try this," Lucy gasped, "Feels really good." She took a deep breath and collapsed flat on the floor. "Fuck." The word slipped out of her. Her long, golden blonde hair pooled around her head.</p>
<p>I stared at Lucy as she lost herself for a moment. My older sister's skimpy outfit revealed way more of her curvy body and tan skin than I was used to seeing. Her breasts looked particularly large in her baby blue v-neck. Her full butt was similarly flattered by her yellow, bikini-cut panties.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but compare myself to my sister. My hair was closer to brown than blonde. If Lucy was all circles, then I was straight lines. We had the same blue eyes, and our faces were similar, sort of, but that was about it.</p>
<p>Lucy came back to consciousness. "Seriously, Dylan, come here," she said, an edge of annoyance in her voice.</p>
<p>Tentatively, I stepped inside her doorframe.</p>
<p>"What's up?" I asked, playing dumb.</p>
<p>As a 19-year-old boy, just two years younger than Lucy, I knew what masturbation looked like. But I'd never seen anyone do it that way with a pillow. And I certainly wasn't prepared for my sister to openly share it.</p>
<p>Lucy and I had always been close. Unlike our friends (and our other siblings) who seemed to be suffocated by their close relationships -- fighting each other for air -- Lucy and I both basked in our shared spaces. We were playmates as kids and confidants as teens. I told my sister nearly everything and had an easy expectation that she would do the same.</p>
<p>But we weren't, you know. Like this.</p>
<p>It was awkward when we watched a movie, and a sex scene came on. I felt uncomfortable folding Lucy's underwear when I did the laundry. I noticed my sister had a nice body because she was super curvy and stuff. But I didn't, like, sneak on her in the shower or ogle at her bathing suit when we went down the shore.</p>
<p>We were, you know, normal siblings. Until that random afternoon when my sister called me into her bedroom while she was grinding her pussy against a pillow.</p>
<p>"Come on, try this with me," Lucy said. She wiggled her butt purposefully, clearly starting her process all over again.</p>
<p>"You mean, like, lying on the ground?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Not exactly," Lucy said. She looked up at me, her face pink and sweaty with exertion. "You put a pillow down. And you lie on top of it. Then you kind of press down. You know? Feels awesome."</p>
<p>I can't say why I listened. It should have been weird -- OK, it was weird -- but for whatever reason I treated it more like my older sister was inviting me to try a new game or watch a movie. Gingerly, I stepped into her bedroom. Like me, Lucy was a bit of a geek. She had a flatscreen TV with a couple consoles attached. Her tan bedroom walls had posters from Breath of the Wild and Animal Crossing. Her room was a peaceful, welcoming place.</p>
<p>But in the moment, it felt almost foreboding. Like the air itself was all charged up. As soon as I stepped inside, I was hit with the scent of my sister's honey-sweet perfume mixed with something else; instinctively familiar.</p>
<p>"Grab the one from my bed," Lucy said, breathily.</p>
<p>I took the pillow -- a sad, floppy, lime green thing whose filling had fled long ago -- and dropped it on the ground. I fluffed the pillow as best I could, then lay down on top of it. I adjusted myself till I had my genitals in what seemed like the right place.</p>
<p>"There you go," Lucy said, "Now just..." Instead of saying it, she did it. Arched herself again. Her wide hips swiveled slightly back and forth on the pillow. Again, I became very aware of my sister's body. Her broad shoulders and long arms. Large breasts and bubble butt. Pretty face and light, sparkling sapphire eyes.</p>
<p>I tried to mirror my sister. I pressed down into the pillow and wiggled a little. And, amazingly -- despite the fact that we were working with very different equipment -- I could kind of see what Lucy was getting at. Like catching a glimpse of a mirage from the far side of the desert.</p>
<p>There were a few problems that kept me from getting closer, however. One, the pillow made things too soft. For my sister, the cushion gave her something to rub against. For me though, I got the sense that I needed something firmer. Honestly, the bare floor would probably have been fine.</p>
<p>But, ironically, the other problem was that I was too hard. Everything around me -- my sister, what she was doing, what she invited me to do -- had led to the inevitable reaction. At any other time, an erection was the perfect way to start getting myself off. But not like this. Some instinctual part of me knew that if my cock was softer, it would be easier to press against the ground and, theoretically, might feel nice.</p>
<p>I looked over at my sister. Unintentionally, we'd ended up facing each other. Quite close. I could see every detail of Lucy's face, screwed up with effort. She was clearly building toward another release. She clenched, held, then flopped in a strained, desperate rhythm. Over and over, like an odd kind of exercise.</p>
<p>I stayed in place, just lightly pressing down. There was the distant sensation that maybe something could be there, but I knew I wouldn't be able to reach it in the moment. Instead, I sort of teased myself while I watched my sister take herself down the path to pleasure.</p>
<p>"Nothing?" Lucy asked, suddenly aware that I was staring at her.</p>
<p>"Kinda?" I said, "I get the feeling it might work if some things were different. But not right now."</p>
<p>"Oh, OK," Lucy said, clearly disappointed. "That's too bad. I'm glad you tried it though."</p>
<p>"Me too," I said.</p>
<p>Carefully, I got off the floor. I tossed Lucy's pillow back on her bed. My older sister was still pressing herself when I left.</p>
<p>I wandered away, feeling shell shocked. Unable to remember where I'd been headed in the first place.</p>
<p>About an hour later, I was in my bedroom -- sweating my balls off while playing Elden Ring -- when the thought popped into my head.</p>
<p>I could be doing it right now.</p>
<p>It was a random idea, borne of nothing, as if my subconsciousness had been chewing on this for a while and finally spit it out.</p>
<p>I put the controller to the side. Looked down at the grey carpet. My bedroom door was shut. The distraction of my repeated virtual deaths meant my dick was soft -- exactly where I needed it to be. I slid off my chair and dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>Like my sister had showed me before, I pressed down with my crotch and arched my back. Like lightning, there it was. This was a very different experience than I was used to. It was more work than stroking myself off, but it also felt fantastic in a slightly different way. Because I was lying on my stomach, in some ways it felt more like fucking, because I could imagine someone under me, feeling the same building pleasure.</p>
<p>Just when I felt myself begin to tire, I reached my apex. My orgasm splattered down my legs in warm, wet spurts. The pleasure overwhelmed me. The effort to reach that place had been so much. The orgasm was a wondrous final reward.</p>
<p>I lay on the floor for a while, smelling my carpet. Muscles aching like I'd done an hours' worth of exercise. I drifted in and out of a strange, altered consciousness. Only dimly aware of the world around me.</p>
<p>The family all came home around the same time for dinner. Mom had grabbed Chinese on the way back from work and we all loaded up our plates. We had a tiny, circular dining room table that my dad had found at a yard sale down the street. It was big enough for four, but not six, so Lucy and I set out stack tables in the nearby living room and ate on the couch.</p>
<p>For such a large family -- Mom, Dad, my three sisters and myself -- dinner was upsettingly silent. I remembered how meals used to be, all of us carousing around the big table, talking excitedly about what had happened that day. Here, though, the clatter of utensils and plates overwhelmed whatever urge we might have had to say anything to each other. And what was there to talk about, really?</p>
<p>I waited till everyone seemed truly lost in their own worlds, then I elbowed Lucy. She turned and glared at me.</p>
<p>"What was that for?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I did it," I said, under my breath, "I made it work. In my bedroom."</p>
<p>"Oh, awesome," Lucy said, her face shifting from slightly irritated to fully excited. Her eyes lit up like bright blue fire. "How was it?"</p>
<p>I looked down at the ground, shyly. I guess some things still felt strange to admit to my sister.</p>
<p>"Nice," Lucy said, and gave my shoulder a playful shove.</p>
<p>After dinner, our siblings left to go hang out with their respective friends, leaving Lucy and me to watch TV with our parents. It's not that we didn't have our own social groups because we did. But most of our friends had gone away to college, while we were now at County, and so we had fewer social options.</p>
<p>I suppose we could have gone out, the two of us, but it was awkward to wander around our old hometown. The thought of running into people, of having to explain what had happened -- I don't think either of us was anticipating that interaction. So, instead, we stayed on the couch and watched TV with my parents.</p>
<p>It didn't take long, however, for Mom and Dad to shuffle off to sleep, and so we found ourselves sitting together on the beat-up couch. Almost close enough to be cuddling.</p>
<p>"You want to do it?" Lucy asked.</p>
<p>"Huh?" I asked. I looked over at my sister. She was wearing a long, light pink, sleep shirt that went down to her knees -- hiding her ample curves. She gave me a winking smile, like she was telling a dirty joke.</p>
<p>"Do you want to?" Lucy asked again. Suddenly, I realized what she meant.</p>
<p>"Here? Now?"</p>
<p>"Upstairs," Lucy said. She didn't wait for my response, just stood up and glided out of the living room. I mean, was I truly going to sit and watch TV by myself at that point?</p>
<p>Back in Lucy's bedroom, I found her already lying splayed on the floor, pillow strategically placed under her. She'd lifted her sleep shirt up to her waist, exposing a pair of robins' egg blue, bikini-cut panties.</p>
<p>Lucy grunted hello, then ground into the ground. "You need a pillow?" she asked, throatily.</p>
<p>"Nah," I said. I lay down on the floor. I could feel myself stiffening already, and I knew I needed to take the opportunity before the act became impossible.</p>
<p>Lucy's hardwood floors felt even better than my carpet. We were facing each other again. Hearing my sister's gulping breaths, feeling her body tremble nearby, all of it conspired to take my experience from a solid 7 to a tremendous 10. Moments later, I was shooting hot seed into my shorts.</p>
<p>"You go?" Lucy asked. She looked about to hit the precipice, herself. Her cheeks were pinker than her shirt.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Ahhhhhhh," Lucy was overtaken by her own orgasm. Her eyes rolled back, and she collapsed. "Fuck that's nice."</p>
<p>Lucy picked up her head and met my eyes. Her look was dreamy, distant. Yet there was something focused beneath the surface. Like she was making a decision.</p>
<p>We shared a goofy grin.</p>
<p>"That's it for you?" Lucy asked.</p>
<p>"Pretty much," I said. I had no doubt I could squeeze another orgasm out of myself. But the rubbing took a lot out of me. Something about it was so much more taxing than the usual stroking off.</p>
<p>"Well, OK," Lucy said, "I'll see you in the morning."</p>
<p>I knew, right then, that she wasn't making the usual, trite statement. It was an appointment.</p>
<p>A promise.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes a while to settle into a new habit. Retraining your body, your mind, to incorporate a different routine. That was not the case for Lucy and me. We were barely past our first day of this and already our fresh tradition felt expected. As if we'd been doing it our entire lives and would continue to do so forever more.</p>
<p>Lucy called it pressing and so that's how I came to think of our activity. It wasn't always at the same time or even every day, but we managed to have regular regroups. One morning we might wake up, press together, and get ready for the day. Or after lunch, we'd have an afternoon press in between doing chores or playing games or whatever. And if we missed both of those (or were having a particularly 'active' day) we'd go for a press after dinner, right before bed.</p>
<p>Outside of our little meetups, everything else was normal. We weren't flirty with each other. We didn't even talk about what we were doing. We always wore clothes when we did it -- Lucy with some sort of shirt and panties, me in my t-shirt and shorts. We met up, pressed, and went back to our lives. Like all of this was happening in some separate, bubble universe.</p>
<p>The way everything became casual, however, was also nearly our downfall. Three times, with three separate people, we were almost caught.</p>
<p>The first was my fault. It happened a little over a week after we'd started our escapades. The family had finished dinner and was watching TV. It was one of those rare evenings when all six of us were home, and Lucy and I found ourselves sitting on the floor, in front of the couch.</p>
<p>Lucy turned to me, mid-episode, and cocked her eyebrow. She subtly jutted her chin. That was all I needed to know. I gave her a single nod.</p>
<p>It was on.</p>
<p>A moment later, Lucy said she was feeling tired and went to her bedroom. I waited what felt like a good amount of time (but was probably only two minutes) and followed her upstairs.</p>
<p>I found my sister already lying on her pillow. She gave me a big, goofy grin as I lay down next to her. The process of this had made me start to chub up, but I'd learned to (literally) push through such things. We humped the ground together, the sounds of boring TV news playing in the distance.</p>
<p>There was this strange intimacy to our act, stolen in little moments. For the most part, I stayed within myself, engaged in my own fantasies. But then I would hear Lucy make a little gasp as she hit the right spot. Or I would grunt with the exertion of the act. Sometimes we'd accidentally bump each other -- arms or legs, never anything more. It was strangely reassuring, an encouragement of the illicit actions we were sharing.</p>
<p>"What are you guys doing?"</p>
<p>I froze. I slowly turned my head to the source of the sound. Our younger sister, Lindsay, was standing in the doorway. In my haste, I'd forgotten to close Lucy's door. Damned.</p>
<p>Lindsay was 17, mousy and thin, with light brown hair (the same color as mine) that hung almost to her waist. She was wearing her usual workout outfit -- a tanktop and yoga pants. She eyed us, confused, like someone searching for an obvious word but unable to find it in the moment.</p>
<p>"Nothing," Lucy said, like this was a perfectly satisfying answer. She didn't even get off the pillow. Just spun around and stared up at our younger sister. "Go away."</p>
<p>Lindsay did not do that. Instead, she stayed at the door, narrowing her eyes like she was processing everything.</p>
<p>"It's fine, Lindsay," I said, the panic rising in my throat. "We're hanging out."</p>
<p>"We're planning your birthday gift," Lucy said. This was a particularly bad lie, since we were doing nothing that looked like planning. And Lindsay's 18th birthday was still a good two months away.</p>
<p>But while our youngest sister was super sweet, she wasn't very sharp. She wasn't a dope, just far too trusting. The kind of girl who couldn't understand that people might lie to her for their own benefit.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she said, brightly, "OK." And quickly scampered away.</p>
<p>I wasn't going to argue with our good luck. I got off the floor, gently closed Lucy's door, and returned to what we were doing.</p>
<p>The second time we almost got caught, though, was on Lucy (somewhat). It was a Saturday afternoon, a week or so later, and she found me watching TV in the living room. She was wearing a white t-shirt with a pink Tom Nook on it, as well as a pair of green sweat-shorts. Her breasts and bottom seemed liable to break out of both at any minute.</p>
<p>Lucy gave me our signal and I got off the couch. But instead of leading me back to her bedroom, Lucy shook her head.</p>
<p>"Here," she said. That one word was shocking, for all that it implied. I glanced around the room. Right out in the open? We were sure to be seen.</p>
<p>"No one's home," Lucy said, "They're all out doing errands or whatever." She grabbed a pillow off the couch -- blue, small, and squarish -- and dropped it on the floor.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>Lucy gave me a chastising look. You'd think that would be hard based on how she was lying on her groin, getting ready to fuck the hell out of that poor cushion. But, somehow, my older sister still managed to look disdainful. I shrugged and dropped next to her.</p>
<p>I have to admit, changing our surroundings did something to the whole experience. I'm not saying we got bored of the usual stuff, but after weeks of it, there was a sort of numbness to the routine of it all. Doing it in another place -- a room where we spent so much time with the rest of our family -- gave everything a sharper edge.</p>
<p>I went over the top first. Unlike Lucy's peak, mine required some post-orgasm maintenance. So, I got up to go find a tissue. Fortunately, my splooge had mostly stayed in my shorts, though I had a drop or two on my leg.</p>
<p>As I went toward the bathroom, however, I felt a hand on my chest. I stopped in place. Standing in front of me, right at the top of the stairs, was our oldest sister, Jan. My twenty-three-year-old sibling had obviously seen everything. So much for an empty house.</p>
<p>Jan raised her eyebrow at me in a way that was totally different than Lucy's come-hither gesture. It was more like drawing a dagger.</p>
<p>"Tell me you two aren't doing what I think you're doing," Jan said. Even though it was a weekend, she was dressed in a nice, pink blouse and a dark navy skirt. She had her near-black hair tied back in a severe bun. She'd done her makeup, as well, making her angular features appear almost devastatingly beautiful. I felt very much like a turd she'd found on the stairs. "Tell me this isn't what it looks like," Jan repeated.</p>
<p>I paused. I didn't know what to say, except to parrot it back. "It isn't what it looks like," I said. Like that was going to make a difference.</p>
<p>Jan's blue eyes, remarkably similar to Lucy's, hardened.</p>
<p>"It's not," I said.</p>
<p>"OK," Jan said. I braced for the impact. Instead, my oldest sister stared me down for another moment, then spun on her heel and walked away.</p>
<p>Later, I told Lucy about it, expecting her to freak out. Instead, she laughed.</p>
<p>"Don't sweat it," my blonde, older sister said, a smile still playing on her cute face. "Jan's not going to do anything."</p>
<p>"I don't know," I said, "She seemed pretty angry."</p>
<p>"Jan's always angry," Lucy said. I couldn't argue with that. "I'm sorry she caught us. I didn't realize she was home. But Jan's not the tattling type. She's happy to ignore us. Trust me. We just need to be more careful."</p>
<p>Our last brush with danger came soon after. It was by far the most chaste, yet it felt like the riskiest moment of all. Lucy and I had finished dinner and were headed upstairs for our evening session. But as we were about to go into Lucy's room, Mom called after us. Lucy and I shared a nervous look. We walked back down to the kitchen.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Mom was waiting there for us, hands on her hips, in standard mom position. The rest of the family had already scattered. The kitchen was so tiny, it made our mother look like a giant. Even more imposing than usual.</p>
<p>"You two are up to something," Mom said. Her voice was not kind.</p>
<p>The sink was running behind her, stacked to the brim with dishes. A reminder of yet another indignity we'd had to endure with the new house: it didn't even have a dishwasher.</p>
<p>"We're hanging out," I said, shrinking under my mom's pointed interrogation.</p>
<p>Mom shook her head. "It's more than that. I see you two sneaking off at all hours. Always in Lucy's room with the door shut. What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," I said.</p>
<p>"Nothing," Lucy said, "Like Dylan told you, we're just hanging out. Playing games. You know."</p>
<p>Mom's glare deepened, like Jan's had done. Her eyes narrowed, a mirror of Lindsay's from earlier.</p>
<p>"You're up to something," she said, "And I don't like it. Your father and I, this family, we're all going through a lot right now. It's bad enough as is and if you two make it worse, even the tiniest, littlest bit..."</p>
<p>"We're not," Lucy said, "We won't. I promise."</p>
<p>Mom's look didn't soften, but she let out a deep breath. "Fine," she said. She waved us out of the kitchen. "You're both old enough that you don't have to live with us anymore. So, I expect you to be on your best behavior."</p>
<p>"Of course," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Understood," I said.</p>
<p>We escaped back to Lucy's bedroom. That night's session felt strained and anxious. Rushed and unfulfilling. But we still did it.</p>
<p>And that was the larger issue. For all those close calls, for all the very real consequences that came with them, we never stopped what we were doing. We didn't step back or rethink our actions. You'd think that with everything that had gone on, with every warning sign we'd passed, that we'd learn our lesson.</p>
<p>Instead, we escalated.</p>
<p>"You ever think about stuff?" Lucy asked, "You know, when we're doing this?"</p>
<p>We were both post-peak, lying back like bomb victims on Lucy's hardwood floor. It was surprisingly comfortable after a good, hard cum.</p>
<p>"You mean, like, other people?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," Lucy said, "I mean, you're not focusing on how you're making it with my bedroom floor, are you?"</p>
<p>"Of course not," I said.</p>
<p>"You picture anyone specific?" Lucy asked.</p>
<p>"Nah," I said, "It's kind of random. Just 'a girl,' you know?"</p>
<p>My older sister rolled onto her side, giving me a dubious look.</p>
<p>But I recognized a no-win situation when I saw one. If I said I thought about Lucy, I was an incest-obsessed pervert. But if I said some other girl, then I risked hurting my older sister's feelings. So, I turned to my only defense, and turned the question back to Lucy.</p>
<p>"What about you?" I asked, "You ever think about anyone?"</p>
<p>"Not really," Lucy said in a mocking voice, "Just, you know, 'a boy.'"</p>
<p>There was a heavy pause. Each of us waited for the other to crack under the weight of it.</p>
<p>"Come on," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"You started it," I replied. Oh, so very mature.</p>
<p>"Fine," Lucy said, with an exasperated sigh. "There is this one guy at school. He's kinda tall with dark hair. Muscular. Sometimes I picture him."</p>
<p>"This guy have a name?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Probably?" Lucy said, "I've never talked to him. I see him in class sometimes."</p>
<p>"It'd be weird if he didn't have a name," I said, "Like, if he was called Random Hotguy or whatever."</p>
<p>"I'd call him Randy," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Well, that seems appropriate," I said.</p>
<p>I played at being coy, but I couldn't help but feel a little hurt as my sister described a crush who was almost the exact opposite of my skinny, short, light-haired self. I knew it was stupid to feel jealous. For one, she was my sister and so completely off limits. For another, I'd literally forced her to say something. So, what did I expect, exactly?</p>
<p>But that didn't stop me from seething in the moment. And so, I felt the need to take some measure of revenge.</p>
<p>"There is this one girl," I said.</p>
<p>"Do tell," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"She's, um, got brown hair. Brown eyes. Short. She's skinny but in kind of a cute way."</p>
<p>"And where did you find this alluring coat rack?" Lucy asked. Her face was turning sourer by the second.</p>
<p>"You know, around," I said.</p>
<p>"Like around the house maybe?" Lucy asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know what you're talking about."</p>
<p>"Please, you're obviously talking about Kara," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"I'm not perving on your best friend," I said.</p>
<p>Lucy rolled her eyes at me.</p>
<p>"Fine. Maybe a little bit," I said.</p>
<p>Lucy shook her head, dismissively.</p>
<p>"What?" I asked. "What's wrong with Kara? She's your friend, isn't she?"</p>
<p>"I just think you could do better," Lucy said. I realized it, suddenly. Lucy wasn't playing around. Her feelings were actually, honestly hurt. As if she hadn't done the same thing to me moments before.</p>
<p>"Well, what about Randy?" I asked. "I mean, the guy doesn't even have a real name. Don't you think you should set your sights a little higher?"</p>
<p>Lucy went quiet. She pursed her lips. The air in the room felt thick and heavy. Filled with anger and resentment. More than either of us could carry. After weeks of unbreakable buoyancy, this one silly conversation had popped us both.</p>
<p>I started to get off the floor, but Lucy stopped me.</p>
<p>"There is this one other guy," she said. Her cheeks went a little red.</p>
<p>I realized my sister was making a peace offering and, fortunately, I was smart enough to accept it. I let myself be held in place.</p>
<p>"He's really cute, kinda handsome," Lucy said, "Light brown hair. Nice body." She ran her eyes up and down me, like punctuating her point.</p>
<p>I let out a loud sigh and lay back down on the floor. "Seriously?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I mean, you're right next to me," Lucy said. "It's kind of hard not to. I see your face. Your eyes. You're actually quite attractive you know that?"</p>
<p>"Even though I'm short and skinny with light hair, and have an actual real name?" I said.</p>
<p>"Even though," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Well, as long as we're being honest, there is this other girl I sometimes think about," I said, "She's very pretty. Gorgeous, honestly. And her body is like, wow. She's really hot."</p>
<p>Lucy looked down at herself, dubiously. "Not too fat?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Oh my God, no," I said immediately. "She's practically fucking perfect."</p>
<p>"Wow," Lucy said. She breathed it out in a little sigh. Almost like one of the sounds she'd make when she was about to peak.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I know I shouldn't but..."</p>
<p>"It's OK," Lucy said, "I get it.</p>
<p>"Like you said, it's hard not to," I said, "In the moment. You're there, you know? Feeling you bump against me. Hearing your little noises. It's kinda awesome, actually."</p>
<p>"Kind of?" Lucy asked, but I could see she was teasing. "You sure you wouldn't rather a certain skinny brunette?"</p>
<p>"I prefer blondes," I said. A pause. "Are you OK with that? I know it's wrong and all, but."</p>
<p>"I'm fine with it," Lucy said. She put her hand on mine. Just that little touch felt electric. "As long as you're OK with me doing it, too."</p>
<p>"Yeah," I said, "Yes. I'm OK with that."</p>
<p>Everything seemed settled. The next day went on as normal. Even that night, when we held our regular pressing session, it was like nothing had changed.</p>
<p>But when Lucy reached her apex, she gasped out. "Oh Dylan," she said, "So good."</p>
<p>Then dropped limp to the floor.</p>
<p>And so, we started talking.</p>
<p>Again, never outside our little meetups. We didn't get flirty in the kitchen or tease each other in front of the TV. But when we'd press, it was like one long running conversation. Whether we were talking to ourselves or communicating with each other I can't say for sure. But we became downright chatty as we made ourselves cum.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's the spot. Right there," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Fuck that's nice," I said, "So good."</p>
<p>"Gonna cum... So close," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Ah... cumming..." I said.</p>
<p>Nothing else changed.</p>
<p>There were times when I wished for more. I imagined Lucy taking her shirt off, her massive tits trembling as she took herself to paradise. I thought about grabbing her hand when I came. Or, for that matter, us giving up on the floor and grinding against each other.</p>
<p>These were passing thoughts, fast fantasies, that usually disappeared immediately post-press. Despite our daily actions, the things we said to each other, I kept Lucy filed safely away in my 'sister' folder. I was unable to imagine ever storing her under a different category.</p>
<p>Summer stretched languid around us. Dad, Mom, and our older sister Jan all got busy with work. Our younger sister Lindsay disappeared all day to be with her friends. Family dinners were few and far between. Lucy and I mostly hung out with each other.</p>
<p>The next step was probably inevitable.</p>
<p>"Fuck that feels so good," Lucy said as she pressed down on her pillow. We were back in my older sister's bedroom, doing what we did best -- getting ourselves off while we got on with each other.</p>
<p>"You like that?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes," Lucy said, "Oh Dylan you have no idea. How good this makes me feel."</p>
<p>"I'd be damn better than a pillow," I said.</p>
<p>"And I'm sure I'm much more than a floor," Lucy said, "You want that? Feel my body -- AH! -- beneath you?"</p>
<p>"So soft and warm," I said, "Your breasts. That ass."</p>
<p>"So hard," Lucy said, "Aching. Thrusting. OH! Oh Dylan. I'm getting close. You gonna let your big sister cum for you?"</p>
<p>"Please. I'm there, too. Let go. I want to see it. Feel it. Feel you cum."</p>
<p>"Oh OH! Oh yes!" Lucy shook. Shuddered.</p>
<p>As if her orgasm sparked mine, the pleasure overwhelmed me. Hot spurts shooting down my leg.</p>
<p>"Oh, fuck that was good," Lucy said.</p>
<p>She rolled over and kissed me on the top of the head.</p>
<p>It was shocking, that sudden contact. Like another wall had been broken through. I swear I could smell the dusty, chipped plaster as my sister busted through yet another barrier.</p>
<p>I rolled over to look at her. I'm sure she saw the shock in my face. Instead, my older sister shrugged.</p>
<p>"Just thanking you," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"I didn't do anything," I said.</p>
<p>"If you say so," Lucy said, and she winked my way.</p>
<p>I started to get up. Flopped back. Like I said, that hardwood floor was incongruently comfy after an explosive orgasm. I imagined a pointy rock might feel the same at that point, honestly. That was the thing about cumming, everything around me felt soft and welcoming. My mind, however, became far sharper.</p>
<p>"What are we doing?" I asked.</p>
<p>Again, Lucy shrugged.</p>
<p>"No, seriously, what is this?"</p>
<p>"Fun," Lucy said, as if it were obvious.</p>
<p>"So, we keep doing it," I said.</p>
<p>"At least till we go back to school in the Fall," Lucy said, "Why not? You have something better to do?"</p>
<p>I had to concede that I did not. The friends that I might want to talk to had all gone off to their lives. The people I very much did not want to see were right outside our front door. It was too easy to feel trapped by a bunch of circumstances that were out of my control.</p>
<p>Lucy seemed to be feeling the same thing. She sat down next to me, leaning back on her bed frame.</p>
<p>"Look, the past year has been so hard," Lucy said, "Dad losing his job. Then losing the house. Having to come home from school and go back to County. This place. I know it's where we live but it's not home. Even the smells are so unfamiliar. I don't like it here. I don't like this. It sucks for you too, right?"</p>
<p>"It's fucking miserable," I said.</p>
<p>"Right," Lucy said, "And this is just... Look, I'm not saying it's my life or anything. It's a distraction. But it's kind of keeping me sane right now. So, I don't want to stop. We'll move on when it's time. I know we will."</p>
<p>"That makes sense," I said, "Honestly, it's helping me, too."</p>
<p>"We'll reach a certain point," Lucy said, "It'll be easy. One day we'll stop doing it and it won't even feel different. You'll look back and realize 'oh, it's been so long since we did it.'"</p>
<p>"Just like that?"</p>
<p>"Don't you think so?" Lucy said, "Besides it's not like we're doing anything serious here. We're not even touching."</p>
<p>I thought back to that kiss on the head my sister had given me. For a moment, I realized that we were both deceiving ourselves. But that's the thing about a mirage. It's all about how badly you want to see it.</p>
<p>The summer got hotter. Mom talked a big game about buying some window air conditioners, but they never materialized. Lucy and I, already down to t-shirts and shorts, were running out of ways to stay cool. I knew it was bad when Lucy said it was even too hot to press.</p>
<p>I reached the breaking point one afternoon when the knob of my bedroom door melted off in my hand. I wish I was exaggerating, but there I was, standing stupidly in the hallway, with a broken knob in my hand and no way to get back into my bedroom.</p>
<p>Instead, I went downstairs. Lucy was lazing on the couch, stretched out and miserable. She had on a pair of red mesh shorts and a white, ribbed tank. Her top was slightly pulled up, uncovering her cute tummy.</p>
<p>"This house sucks!" she said, writhing in discomfort.</p>
<p>I held up my doorknob as evidence.</p>
<p>"What's that?" she asked.</p>
<p>I explained and she giggled, then groaned. "Oh my God, we're both going to be burnt hamburger here in the house."</p>
<p>"We could go out," I said.</p>
<p>"It's hotter out there than it is here," Lucy said, "Let's watch a movie. About something cold."</p>
<p>"Do you think that'll help?" I asked.</p>
<p>But Lucy was already surfing the screen. Finally, she settled on some old rom-com called The Cutting Edge about competitive ice skating. It was barely watchable, and it didn't help me feel any cooler. But Lucy seemed happy, and it was too hot to argue. It's not like I could go back to my bedroom.</p>
<p>About halfway through -- the female lead kept saying the words 'toe pick' -- Lucy paused the movie.</p>
<p>"I want to take my shirt off," she said, in a strangely matter of fact tone.</p>
<p>"OK?" I gave my sister an odd look.</p>
<p>"You can take yours off, too," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm aware of that," I said, "It's a little different when I do it."</p>
<p>"Look, it's really hot," Lucy said, seemingly unaware of the double entendre. "And I'm super uncomfortable. Seeing me in a bra won't even make the top ten of things you've witnessed from me lately. So, I'm going to do this and you're going to be OK with it. OK?"</p>
<p>Oh, I was way more than OK in that moment. Did I mention my sister's chest was amazing? It was much more than that. Lucy had epic breasts. I knew it, despite the fact that I'd never seen more than the shape of them under her shirt. So yeah, no, I was more than alright with my sister taking her shirt off on the couch. If anything, I was sad that she'd already set the limit at leaving her bra on.</p>
<p>But this was weird right? Tell me I'm not strange for thinking it was weird that my big sister was going to take out her titties in the middle of the living room in front of her younger brother, as casually as pouring herself a drink.</p>
<p>Yet, no matter how I felt about it, my sister was doing it. Lucy reached down for the bottom of her tank and pulled it over her head. You'd think she was ripping off a band-aid, not exposing her twin holiest of holies to her kid brother. But Lucy kept it casual.</p>
<p>I more than made up for Lucy's lack of concern, however, with my own reaction. I gaped. I gawped. My sister sat back on the couch in nothing but a lacy black bra and a pair of tiny, scarlet shorts. You'd think she'd just showed me the mysteries of the universe. And, to some extent, she truly had.</p>
<p>There are no words to describe what Lucy had revealed to me. Her bra covered a good portion of her breasts, but still. Her boobs were massive. Full and proud. Yet perfectly shaped and wonderfully peachy. I know I'm doing a lousy job of describing them. I'm sure you're thinking 'dude, they're just boobs, and your sister's boobs at that.' But I'm telling you. That's my point. They were so much more than anything I can describe to you. Like discovering the sun after a lifetime of darkness.</p>
<p>And, again, I was only seeing about a third of them thanks to Lucy's lacy bra.</p>
<p>"Ahem," Lucy cleared her throat, dramatically.</p>
<p>"Sorry," I said, and did my best to stop staring. It was like trying to look away from a black hole, so strong was that pull to peek.</p>
<p>"Ahem hem," Lucy did it again, even louder this time. She gestured to my chest.</p>
<p>"Oh," I said, "Right." I didn't remember agreeing to this literal tit for tat, but I wasn't going to step away from it, either. I pulled off my t-shirt, sticky with sweat, and tossed it aside.</p>
<p>"Very nice," Lucy said, looking at me appraisingly.</p>
<p>"You know, I'm completely bare while you're still wearing your bra. It seems to me it would be more even if we were both topless," I said. I mean, can you blame me for trying?</p>
<p>Lucy smirked and shook her head. "Nice try, little brother," she said. She turned the movie back on.</p>
<p>We finished the film, both of us staying in our state of half-dress. You won't be surprised to learn that I missed most of what was on the screen. Look, I'm sure that Moira Kelly was kind of cute for her day, but compared to Lucy's luscious, stupendous, lace-covered chest, nothing else could compete.</p>
<p>I spent the entire time stealing glances when I thought my sister wasn't looking. It wasn't enough. A lifetime's pass to stare wouldn't have been enough.</p>
<p>When the movie was over, when the guy finally got the girl, Lucy looked my way. I was ready to get berated for my inability to keep my eyes off my sister's mounds. Instead, she raised an eyebrow. Pointed her chin. Well, I guess it wasn't too hot after all.</p>
<p>"Here's fine," Lucy said, sliding off the couch.</p>
<p>Instinctively I looked around. If the house hadn't been empty, I was pretty sure we'd have already been caught by now. I joined my older sister on the living room floor.</p>
<p>Lucy reached for a pillow off the couch. She didn't bother grabbing for her shirt. Oh. My. God. As if things couldn't get any better. Seeing my sister lying on her stomach -- about to pleasure herself with a pillow -- with her breasts hanging near-free in her bra? I swear I felt my sanity start to snap.</p>
<p>"You like my titties?" Lucy asked, her face cinched as she pressed down.</p>
<p>For some reason, the word 'titties' sounded strange coming out of her mouth. The sight of her humping the floor was more than enough to overwhelm my momentary pause.</p>
<p>"You look so sexy," I said. I settled into the floor. Honestly, I was too hard at that point to hump. It didn't matter. Watching Lucy was more than enough.</p>
<p>"Oh, that feels so good," Lucy said, "Seeing you staring. Am I truly so amazing, little brother?"</p>
<p>"You have no idea," I said.</p>
<p>"Think about it. Doing this. Holding me. Squeezing. Would you like that? Do you -- OH! -- want to feel my body while I do this? While I cum for you?"</p>
<p>"So bad," I said.</p>
<p>"Oh Dylan, I wish you could..." Lucy froze mid-moment. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Then why aren't you... you know?"</p>
<p>"Oh," I said. I was surprised she even noticed that I wasn't stuffing myself against the floor. "Well, um, you see. It's kinda hard to do this when I'm hard."</p>
<p>"Aw, did looking at your sister's titties give you a stiffy?" Lucy asked. Boy, she really did like using that word for her breasts. "I thought getting an erection was supposed to help you with this stuff."</p>
<p>"It does," I said, "It would. It's just, when we do it this way, if I'm too worked up, it hurts when I try to, you know, make things happen."</p>
<p>"Well, what if you did it a different way," Lucy said, "You know, the way that it would work with you erect."</p>
<p>"Lucy, I don't know."</p>
<p>"Take it out," Lucy said, "Show me. It's OK. I want to see it. Please."</p>
<p>"No bra," I said. If I was going for it, then I was going for it.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>Lucy didn't say a word. She reached back and unsnapped her black, lacy lingerie. She pulled it away and finally, her bare breasts hung free. They were better than I'd been picturing. Plump with phenomenally pert, pink nipples. I lost track of time. Of myself. My whole universe shattered by such a simple moment.</p>
<p>"Your turn," Lucy said. I noticed she'd stopped humping the pillow completely. She was waiting for me to get set.</p>
<p>I stood up and shimmied my shorts and underwear down in one go. My dick popped up, sticking straight out, like an overwound jack-in-the-box. I grabbed it immediately. Unable to control my urge to stroke myself.</p>
<p>Now, it was Lucy's turn to gasp. She stared up at my dick like it was an obelisk. A great and powerful object of desire.</p>
<p>"Wow," Lucy said. It seemed she wanted to add to that sentiment, but her brain was no longer in the business of making words.</p>
<p>I sat down on the couch. My bare bottom stuck to the canvas. Lucy spun herself on the ground so she could tilt her head up and see.</p>
<p>"You like it?" I asked, repeating what Lucy had said before. "Is my cock really so amazing, big sis?"</p>
<p>"Stroke it," Lucy said, "Show me. I need to see."</p>
<p>Like I required a command by that point. My instincts had already kicked in. I gripped my dick and worked the loose skin back and forth. I was only using my hand, and dry at that, but it didn't matter. It felt incredible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, below me, Lucy began trembling as she took herself to town on the pillow.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dylan," she said, "Feels so good. Your cock. So thick. Oh, I want it. Show me."</p>
<p>With everything that had already happened, with all that we were doing, I wasn't going to last long. Fortunately, neither was Lucy.</p>
<p>My older sister rolled up on her groin, pointed her massive tits to the sky, then stiffened. Froze in place. Eyes glazed over. Mouth open. Finally, she broke. She let out a short, sharp sob as the pleasure squeezed out of her.</p>
<p>At that same moment, my cock exploded in my hand. A huge gout of cum rocketed out and splattered on my sister's face. I cried out as my orgasm overwhelmed me.</p>
<p>Lucy rolled over onto her back. She jammed her hand into her shorts and buried it in her pussy, working it like she was trying to rip the poor thing off. She stared up at me, eyes filled with hunger despite having already reached her peak.</p>
<p>I hit her chest with my second shot of semen. Splattered her face again with my third. My sister gasped and groaned as I bathed her in my essence.</p>
<p>Finally, I puddled onto the ground, splayed out next to my sister. The last of my spend leaked out over my fingers. Lucy rolled over and kissed my forehead again. She stank of pussy and sperm. Desire and satisfaction. Brother and sister, in a way we're never supposed to experience.</p>
<p>"You got me," Lucy said, gasping for breath, "Got me good."</p>
<p>"Sorry," I said.</p>
<p>"No way, that was awesome," Lucy said. "Going to need a shower now though."</p>
<p>"Me too," I said.</p>
<p>Lucy didn't miss what I was implying. For a moment, my big sister stared at me. She had my cum in her hair. On her massive tits. Both of us were barely clothed. Was I really asking for that much more?</p>
<p>To my surprise, my older sister actually seemed to consider my offer. But then she jumped up and skipped away.</p>
<p>July rolled into August. The heatwave ended, and while it wasn't exactly comfortable, we left unbearable back in the rearview mirror. I thought, after everything that had happened, that we'd progress more. Maybe Lucy would repeat her performance and take her top off or ask me to show her my dick. But none of that happened. Instead, we went back to regular old pressing.</p>
<p>At least for a little while.</p>
<p>In the meantime, life didn't stop moving around us. With time to school getting closer, needs outside of masturbating with my sister began to take precedence. We drove to County a couple of times to make sure everything was set with the registrar and to get our supplies for the year.</p>
<p>Our little sister, Lindsay, was getting ready for her last year of high school, and we helped her get set up. Lindsay was going to join us at County after high school, so we took her with us to see the campus, too.</p>
<p>Lucy and I did our usual chores -- food shopping, laundry, cooking meals. My parents were still working like dogs, but our older sister, Jan, got a bit of a break midway through the month and we met her in the city for lunch. Jan made no mention of the previous 'incident' and certainly we had nothing to say about it.</p>
<p>In other words, we acted like perfectly normal siblings, enjoying our summer break as best we could, considering the circumstances. You'd never know we were slipping away for shared masturbation sessions every now and then.</p>
<p>Except we totally were.</p>
<p>"I want to try something different this time," Lucy announced when I came into her bedroom. It was a random Wednesday and she'd found me in the laundry room, folding clothes. She'd given me the chin jut and here we were, getting ready to get off under the watchful eye of Link and Tom Nook, eyeing us from Lucy's bedroom walls.</p>
<p>The fact that Lucy had spoken up at all already had me nervous. Sure, we talked dirty to each other during the act, but we never came out and discussed the mechanics of what we were up to. Not really.</p>
<p>I assumed Lucy meant that she wanted me to jerk off again. Which, I was totally up for. I was all prepared to let her know that I was fine with it (in exchange for a boob reveal, natch), when she swerved so hard it nearly knocked me over.</p>
<p>"I'm just thinking," Lucy said, "Instead of using the floor or a pillow or whatever, it might be nice to try it together."</p>
<p>I raised an eyebrow. Wasn't that what we'd been doing?</p>
<p>"No, I mean, like. If you were pressing on me. And I was pressing on you. It might feel even better, you know?"</p>
<p>I was too shocked to respond. What was Lucy suggesting, exactly?</p>
<p>"We'd wear our clothes," Lucy said, as if that made things better. "It would be the same as always. Sort of."</p>
<p>It was that sort of that really set it apart, wasn't it? I think some part of me was convinced, even after what we'd done during the movie, that this remained normal sibling behavior. That you could tell someone about it, and they wouldn't stare at you in horror. I mean, I wasn't going to proactively bring it up at parties or anything. But I thought it was something I could confess to if needed.</p>
<p>This, though -- what Lucy was suggesting -- was so close to actual sex with my sister, I didn't know how to respond. Would I, like, touch her? Would we kiss? Would she grab my butt while I pressed against her?</p>
<p>"Well, we'll have to touch," Lucy answered, "Definitely no kissing, though. And as to your butt, well, you do have a nice ass. But I'll try to restrain myself if you will."</p>
<p>"I don't know, Lucy," I said.</p>
<p>"Pleeeeeease," Lucy said, "If we don't like it, we can stop. I promise it'll be awesome, and I bet it'll feel way better than doing it on the floor. And it won't be anything different than we're already doing. It's almost exactly the same thing. Truly."</p>
<p>"So, you would, like, lie down. And I would be on top of you. And we would sort of, um, align?"</p>
<p>"Exactly," Lucy said. She clapped her hands. Somehow, it seemed, I'd agreed to do this without realizing it.</p>
<p>My buxom, beautiful, blonde older sister climbed onto her bed and lay on her back. She patted the comforter, like asking a puppy to jump up and join her for a snuggle. Per usual, Lucy was wearing a t-shirt and tiny shorts. Yellow and green, respectively.</p>
<p>I had on a shirt, as well, and a pair of grey sweat-shorts. The thought of lying on my sister clearly appealed to one part of my anatomy, because I was already achingly erect. For once, my hard-on was going to be an advantage when we went to press.</p>
<p>I climbed onto the bed. It was oddly soft, like trying to crawl across a Bounce House with fifty kids going to town on it. I dragged myself next to my sister. Our faces so close, our noses could practically touch.</p>
<p>"Like this," I said.</p>
<p>"Whole body," Lucy said.</p>
<p>I climbed over my older sister. She spread her thick thighs. Holy fuck. This was oh-so-very-much like fucking. The clothes did not make a damned difference, I swear they didn't.</p>
<p>Lucy seemed to be rethinking her idea, as well. Like the sudden closeness finally brought it home to her about what she was about to do with her brother. She gave me a nervous smile as I adjusted myself. But she didn't stop me.</p>
<p>Gingerly, I aimed my groin over my sister's. Then I slowly lowered it down. My hardness pressed into her. I couldn't tell if I had the right spot or not.</p>
<p>"Little higher," Lucy said. "To the left."</p>
<p>Through layers of clothing, I couldn't truly tell whether I was pressing against a leg, a tummy, or a pussy. But my sister sure knew when I hit her cleft because she let out a long, satisfied sigh.</p>
<p>"There you go," Lucy said. She brushed her hair out of her eyes. "That's the spot."</p>
<p>My older sister looked up at me, expectantly. Again, we shared an anxious grin.</p>
<p>"OK?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, OK," Lucy said.</p>
<p>I became very aware of her soft, warm body. Her breasts pressing into my chest. Her legs on either side of mine. The smell of her shampoo -- apple-y and sweet. Her full lips and cute little tongue. The endless blue-sky of her eyes. Not a cloud in sight for miles.</p>
<p>Lucy seemed to be examining me in the same way. Her eyes and body adjusting to mine. She put her hand up to touch my cheek, then ripped it away like it burned her.</p>
<p>"Sorry," she said, "Habit."</p>
<p>I didn't have a good sense of my sister's sexual experience. I knew she'd had boyfriends and I was sure they'd done more than kiss. I didn't bother asking because she was my big sister, and it was none of my business. She certainly never inquired about my (meager) dating history.</p>
<p>Now, though, intimately on top of each other, I wondered if this was something my sister had shared with someone else. We say 'virginity' like it's a singular thing and I suppose it can be. But there are all sorts of 'virginities' if you think about it -- an endless number of intimate acts we can experience for the first time. I couldn't help but wonder if my sister was sharing one of those with me in that very moment. The same way I was giving my own to her.</p>
<p>"You can press," Lucy said, "I'm ready."</p>
<p>I nodded. With my hardness firmly slotted against my sister, I ground down.</p>
<p>Lucy's eyes flashed. She giggled. Then groaned.</p>
<p>"That's. Definitely. The spot," she said.</p>
<p>"Uh huh," I agreed.</p>
<p>We pushed against each other for as long as we could, then broke. Gasping. Did it again. In some ways, this experience was almost expected. It's what I'd been picturing every time on the floor, after all. And yet it was so different than anything I could have imagined. Beyond my fantasies into something truly unimaginable. Wonderful in every way.</p>
<p>I pressed into my sister and her hands reached up and gripped my butt, pushing me down into her.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Lucy said, but she didn't stop.</p>
<p>I grabbed her shoulders for purchase, in response. For a moment, I thought about reaching lower. I was afraid that one wrong action would end things. I can't imagine how that would have happened. But in the moment, I swear it made sense.</p>
<p>Lucy's gasps and groans got faster. Our actions more frantic. We worked each other to our release. Unlike before, we didn't talk. Didn't need to. All the stimulation we required was right there, with our sibling.</p>
<p>"Close." I managed to squeak out.</p>
<p>"Do it," Lucy said, "Let it go."</p>
<p>A moment later, I felt the warm wetness of my spend spill into my shorts. There was something almost painful about it. Strained. The bliss overtook me. I felt my sister's hand on my head. Stroking my hair lovingly. I became very aware of sharing this intimate, vulnerable thing with my sister. It made everything more satisfying, yet also scarier.</p>
<p>When I got my strength back, I rolled off of Lucy.</p>
<p>"That was nice," she said, "Thank you for letting that happen."</p>
<p>"Did you...?"</p>
<p>"Not really," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," I said, meaning it.</p>
<p>"No, don't be," Lucy said, "Honestly it was totally awesome. Different. I loved it."</p>
<p>I nodded, letting myself believe her. If I thought the floor was comfortable post-cum, you can only imagine how nice it felt to be in Lucy's soft warm bed. I let my head loll against the perfumed pillows.</p>
<p>Then Lucy said something that totally blew my mind.</p>
<p>"I think it would be better if we do it without pants next time," she said.</p>
<p>There wasn't a word in that sentence that didn't make my heart race.</p>
<p>Fortunately (or not, depending on your perspective), my big sister didn't mean naked, which is what I initially thought she intended.</p>
<p>"No, we need underwear, silly!" Lucy said, clearly trying not to laugh.</p>
<p>We were in my bedroom this time. Keeping things fresh, I guess. It was a few days after our previous encounter, and I'd spent the entire time on tenterhooks trying to figure out what Lucy had meant by 'without pants.' Obviously, I'd guessed wrong.</p>
<p>"That would be way too much like actual sex," Lucy explained, as if this were a totally logical way to draw the line. "Also, to be honest we've had to cut back on some necessities because of, well, everything. You know, medical things. So, I'm like, not safe. At the moment. Having at least a layer between me and any of your little swimmers is probably for the best."</p>
<p>"Wow, I'm sorry," I said, "That sucks."</p>
<p>In all that we'd been going through, basic needs like birth control had never occurred to me. I guess being a guy afforded me a few more luxuries than I'd realized. I wondered what else the family was going without in the moment. Things that had never occurred to me.</p>
<p>"It's whatever," Lucy said, "Honestly, it's not the end of the world. Not like I have a boyfriend or anything right now. And Mom thinks we'll be able to get insurance back in a few months, so I'll be good to go."</p>
<p>"OK," I said, "Still, is there's something I can do to help?"</p>
<p>"Well, you can start by taking your pants off so we can do this properly," Lucy said. I mean, if that wasn't the sexiest thing you've ever heard, what is?</p>
<p>I smirked at my sister and lowered my bottoms, careful to keep my boxers in place. Lucy shucked off her own shorts and hopped up onto my bed. She lay back, unable to keep from making a silly giggle.</p>
<p>"OK, same as last time," Lucy said.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you that I was used to being in such close contact with my sister by then. But getting on top of her was the same disorienting experience all over again. I was dizzy like I'd climbed a mountain, rather than mounted my sexy older sibling.</p>
<p>I rested my hardness on Lucy's sex. Well, she was right about one thing, pressing with just underwear on was way different. The thin cloth seemed barely able to contain us. I swore I could feel the heat and dampness of my sister's pussy. I was certain she could feel the warmth of my hard-on. The fly of my boxers never felt so precarious.</p>
<p>I pressed and Lucy moaned. She wrapped her arms and legs around me, holding me close. I became very aware of how much we were bare skin to bare skin. Her legs on mine. I buried my head in the crook of her neck. Her scent overwhelmed me as I ground into her.</p>
<p>"Oh Dylan." Lucy humped up into me. I could tell the pleasure was taking hold of her this time. "So good."</p>
<p>Both of us were slick with sweat. My room was already hot, but now it felt like we were baking. My muscles ached. How was this so much work?</p>
<p>"Getting... close..." Lucy said.</p>
<p>I pressed down as hard as I could. Lucy made this strange, high pitched, strained noise. Then punctuated it with a gasp. The effort put me over the top as well. Both of us came hard, wrapped around each other.</p>
<p>When it was over, Lucy cackled and gave me a peck on the lips. I was so enraptured by my orgasm, by my sister's, I didn't even startle.</p>
<p>"Yup, better with just underwear," Lucy said. She pushed me off of her and I saw I'd left a pretty large wet spot on her panties. She had a few streaks down her legs, as well. The liquid was white, so I knew it wasn't only my sister's lubrication. "No further, though," Lucy said, "It would be way too dangerous."</p>
<p>I nodded my agreement. Both of us drifted off for a nap.</p>
<p>Despite everything going on with the family finances, there was one area that my parents swore we could not skimp on: my baby sister Lindsay's eighteenth birthday party.</p>
<p>We invited everyone we could think of to the house -- family, friends, neighbors -- whoever wanted to come plus quite a few people who probably didn't but showed up anyway. We rented a tent for the backyard, plus tables and chairs. We had catered food, a live band (some of Lindsay's high school friends who agreed to $3/hour, but still), the whole thing.</p>
<p>If there wasn't too much food, too many people, and too much noise there was an overabundance of one thing: alcohol. And that's what led to all the trouble.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time trying to enjoy myself. In some ways, it was nice, seeing all these people -- family and friends that I'd managed to avoid all summer suddenly felt welcome. At least mostly. Every conversation was twinged with the fear that someone was going to start interrogating me about what was going on with me or the family. It gave even the sweetest moments a sour twist.</p>
<p>About a couple of hours into it, I was walking back from the bathroom when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned and saw Lucy standing behind me, grinning from ear-to-ear. She was wearing a sleeveless, summery dress with a pink, floral pattern that showed off her curves. Lucy had a beer in her hand and, judging by the look in her eyes, quite a few more in her belly.</p>
<p>"Hey Dylan," she said, a bit too loudly, "There's someone who wants to say 'hi.'"</p>
<p>Lucy took my hand and led me out to the backyard. There had to be at least twenty people out there, impressive considering the size of our lawn. Lucy pulled me straight through the morass to the back, where a cute brunette was lying back in a recliner. She was wearing a tight, black top with blue jeans and sunglasses. Her dark hair hung past her shoulders.</p>
<p>"Dylan, you remember Kara, don't you?" Lucy said, then collapsed into giggles.</p>
<p>I did my best to say hello while also ignoring my sister. I did, indeed, remember Kara. Lying back in the sun, she was even cuter than my mind had given her credit for. The petite brunette extended her hand, and I gave it a little touch.</p>
<p>"Don't mind Lucy," Kara said, "She's had a few too many, I fear."</p>
<p>"What about you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, definitely don't ignore me," Kara said. She gave me a sly smile.</p>
<p>Lucy started laughing even harder.</p>
<p>"Jeez Lucy, take a breath," I said.</p>
<p>I sat on the end of the lounger and talked to Kara for a bit. She was back from school for a couple weeks, having spent most of the summer in Italy visiting an uncle. She had all sorts of stories about adventures on the Amalfi Coast, eating amazing food, and basically having the experience of a lifetime.</p>
<p>"What about you?" Kara asked, "How's your summer been?"</p>
<p>"Oh, just hanging out," I said, very aware of my sister's presence. I'm sure my cheeks flushed as I said it.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Lucy told me all about it," Kara said. My heart slowed. A rush filled my ears. My sister hadn't told Kara everything everything, had she? "She said you guys have been sitting around the house watching movies or whatever. Sounds miserable."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," I said, relief flooding me. "That's exactly what's been happening."</p>
<p>"Well, I can't say it's exactly been bad for you," Kara said, eyeing me meaningfully, "You look good, Dylan. You filled out."</p>
<p>"Oh, um, thanks," I said, "You do too. Even cuter than I remembered."</p>
<p>"Cuter, huh?" Kara said.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"OK, OK, meet and greet time is over," Lucy said, breaking in. Her voice abruptly serious. "Come on Dylan, we need to go give Lindsay her birthday gift."</p>
<p>"Let's give it to her later," I said. Lucy glared at me so hard, I felt my bones begin to crack.</p>
<p>"What is it with the names in your family, anyway?" Kara asked, oblivious to the implied violence in front of her. "Lucy, Dylan, Lindsay. And what's your older sister's name again?"</p>
<p>"Jan," I said, "My parents are huge classic rock fans."</p>
<p>"Janice Joplin, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Bob Dylan, Lindsay Buckingham." My sister ticked the names off her fingers like it was rote.</p>
<p>"No Stevie, huh?" Kara said, clearly making a joke.</p>
<p>Both Lucy and I eyed each other. There had been a Stevie, but Mom had lost him in the last trimester. It occurred to me -- that was truly when my family's troubles had begun. One long, slow, downhill slope from there. I'd never realized it went that far back, but there it was.</p>
<p>"I'm going to get a drink," Lucy announced. She jumped up, grabbing my arm. "And so are you."</p>
<p>"Sorry," I said, as my sister dragged me away. "It's been a rough summer."</p>
<p>I tried to get back to Kara, but Lucy wouldn't let me.</p>
<p>"Why would you introduce us if you don't want us to talk?" I asked. We were both standing in the kitchen. My older sister had stepped up to mixed drinks, finishing a rum and coke way too quickly for my liking.</p>
<p>"I thought it would be funny," Lucy said, "You know, after what you told me last month. But instead, you had to go and make it all weird."</p>
<p>"Weird?"</p>
<p>"Flirty," Lucy said, "That's not cool. You can't just, like, pick up my best friend, OK?"</p>
<p>"I kind of feel like she was being flirty with me," I said.</p>
<p>"Whatever," Lucy said, putting her cup down forcefully. "It's not OK so don't do it."</p>
<p>I should have let it go at that. I can't play dumb; I knew exactly what the problem was. And if Lucy had been flirting with one of my friends I'd have been equally upset. But in the moment, well, Kara was super cute. And I hadn't lied before, I really had crushed on her pretty hard in high school. To have her get all bothered about me, that was the kind of ego boost I couldn't back off of.</p>
<p>Like Lucy had said, our time together was going to end. We weren't in some forever relationship. So, what if I tried to play the field a little? Was it so wrong to want to be a boyfriend instead of a beating-off little brother? And yeah, maybe I'd had a little more to drink than I'd let on, as well.</p>
<p>So instead of being a supportive sibling and letting it go, I pushed the issue. "I can do what I want," I said, "You're not in charge of me."</p>
<p>Lucy scowled at me. "Fine, go back to your slut," she said. I waited for the argument. Wanted it. Instead, my older sister gave me one last angry look, then flounced off. "See if I give a shit."</p>
<p>I did go back to find Kara, but I was too pissed off to make anything of it. We sat on the lounger and talked about nothing. Not ten minutes later, the skinny brunette told me she had to head out. She gave me her number, but with only a couple weeks till she went back to school in California, it was basically worthless, and she acknowledged as much.</p>
<p>"Stay in touch," Kara said, giving me a quick kiss on the cheek. "I'll be back for Thanksgiving, and you never know."</p>
<p>By then, I was too miserable to care. My big victory had turned to ashes. All I could think about was what I'd said to my sister. How much I'd lost for what little I'd gained.</p>
<p>When Kara left, I rushed back into the house to find Lucy. But she'd melted into the crowd. Finally, after about thirty minutes of searching, I found her slumped into the couch in the family room.</p>
<p>"Heeeeyyyyyy," she slurred out when she saw me. "It's my favorite brother."</p>
<p>Oh damn, she was far drunker than before.</p>
<p>"Look, Lucy, I want to apologize," I said, the words spilling out of me.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, favorite brother," Lucy said, "Come sit with me."</p>
<p>I nestled next to her on the couch. Lucy immediately lolled over me, clumsily wrapping her arms around my shoulders. Her soft chest pressed into mine.</p>
<p>"Ummm, Lucy?"</p>
<p>My sister ignored my half-protest. We were cuddling very intimately on the couch. The room was filled with other people, some of them our friends and family. This was way beyond sibling-level affection, and I was too worried about getting caught to be relieved that my earlier transgressions seemed to have been forgotten.</p>
<p>My sister squeezed me tight, then shifted so our faces were nearly touching. Lucy moved in to kiss me. Not a kiss on the cheek like her best friend had given me, nor a little peck on the lips like Lucy, herself, had once done. My older sister had shifted straight into make out mode.</p>
<p>I did my best to slip from her grip before Lucy could complete the kiss. She was surprisingly strong, but I managed to escape. She grabbed me again, though, and held me centered. She leaned in again, this time pressing her lips to my ear.</p>
<p>"I want you to make love to me," Lucy said. Her tongue tickling on my sensitive flesh.</p>
<p>"What?! Lucy, no," I said.</p>
<p>Again, I pushed her off me. Did I want to have sex with my sister? My conscious mind, my rational aspect, had already decided no. That what we were doing might be dangerous but full-on incest was straight up wrong and so wouldn't happen.</p>
<p>But in my heart (and other places further south), I had to confess that the answer was yes. Yes.</p>
<p>In the moment, though, that choice didn't matter. Lucy was too smashed for me to trust her. I didn't want her having regrets. Instead, I forcefully pushed her off me. My sister fell back into the couch.</p>
<p>"I want to FUCK!" Lucy cried out, throwing her arms in the air. I looked around the room, but fortunately no one else seemed to hear her. Or at least they were polite enough to pretend they hadn't.</p>
<p>"Lucy, please be quiet," I said.</p>
<p>"Quiet me," Lucy said, "Stick that big brother dick inside and shut me up. Make me scream your name. Give it to me, Dylan. I need it."</p>
<p>"No," I said. I held my sister forcefully by the shoulder.</p>
<p>"You don't want me?" Lucy asked. She shifted from lusty to sniffly in a second. It was a frighteningly fast transformation.</p>
<p>"You're drunk," I said.</p>
<p>"I'm fine," Lucy said, starting to stand up. "I thought you cared about me, but I guess I was wrong."</p>
<p>"I do care about you," I said, "I do want you." God it was hard to confess to it, but I knew I had to. It was freeing to finally speak it. Like jumping out of a plane. Thrilling and terrifying all at once. Heart racing. Stomach twisting. "But not like this."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"You've had too much to drink," I said, "I won't take advantage of you. If you feel this way, sober, in the morning. We'll do it."</p>
<p>"I want it now," Lucy said, pouting. "This is your one chance, Dylan. You turn me down, you'll never get this pussy. My big tits. My sweet body. Don't you want it little brother? Don't you want to fuck sissy? Give it to her good? Fill her up with all your naughty little sibling spermies?"</p>
<p>"I do," I said. Well, maybe not that last part. Getting my sister pregnant seemed like a really bad idea. But the rest of it? Yeah, I was up for that. But not if my sister might not mean it.</p>
<p>"Then do it, or I'll find someone else who will," Lucy said.</p>
<p>Again, I searched the room while my sister spoke, desperately hoping that no one could hear. I needed to get her out of there before she got herself in serious trouble. I wrapped my arm around her back and lifted her off the couch.</p>
<p>"Where are we going?" Lucy slurred as I slowly walked her back towards the stairs.</p>
<p>"Time for bed," I said.</p>
<p>"Finally!" Lucy said, "Took you long enough."</p>
<p>"Not like that," I said, "You need to sleep it off."</p>
<p>"What's the matter, bro, am I not hot enough for you?" Lucy asked, then belched. Her breath smelled like a still.</p>
<p>"Let's just get you some rest, OK?"</p>
<p>I helped Lucy up the stairs and led her back to her bedroom. The further we went, the slumpier she got, till I practically had to carry her through her doorway. Carefully, I lowered her onto her bed. She grunted lightly as she hit the mattress and then sighed, smacking her lips with sleep.</p>
<p>For a moment, a protective and perverse part of me considered stripping her out of her party outfit. But I decided it was probably safer to let her sleep it off in her dress. I ran off to the bathroom, grabbed a wastebasket, and put it next to her bed.</p>
<p>"If you need to throw up," I told my sister. She was already halfway to dreamland.</p>
<p>"You have to fuck me," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. I wasn't even sure if she was aware she was talking to me.</p>
<p>"In the morning," I said.</p>
<p>"No," Lucy said, grabbing my arm so tight, it felt like an eagle latching onto a branch. Her eyes went wide and suddenly she was wide awake. "Now! Do me right this second or it's over between us Dylan. You can go back to stroking it all by your sad self. I swear to God, it's now or never."</p>
<p>"Fine, we'll do it now," I said.</p>
<p>Lucy smiled at me, then softened. She let her head lay back on the pillow again. "Thaasss a good boy," she murmured. "Ravish me."</p>
<p>"I just need to get a condom real quick and I'll come right back."</p>
<p>"OK," Lucy said. Her eyes were already fluttering shut. "Come back and give it to me. So good."</p>
<p>I extricated my arm and tiptoed back from the bed. Lucy's eyes were shut. She was still murmuring, but I was pretty sure she was passed out or close to it.</p>
<p>When I got to the door, she repeated my name. I froze.</p>
<p>"I love you, Dylan," Lucy said, absently.</p>
<p>"I love you, too," I said.</p>
<p>"No, I mean I love you love you," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "Me too."</p>
<p>A moment later, my sister went completely silent. I waited to make sure, then slipped back outside of her bedroom.</p>
<p>I returned to the party, but I wasn't feeling it. Things were starting to break up, anyway. Eventually, after just about everyone had left, I climbed into bed. I was exhausted, but wide awake. My mind raced with everything that had happened with Lucy -- all that we'd said and done. And hadn't done.</p>
<p>Eventually I guess I fell asleep because the next memory I have is of someone knocking on my bedroom door. It felt like they were beating on my skull. Too much alcohol and not enough sleep had left me in quite a state.</p>
<p>Carefully, I got up from bed. I realized I'd never changed out of my slacks and dress shirt from the night before. I limped to the door.</p>
<p>Lucy was on the other side, looking quite a wreck herself. Her dress was half off her shoulder and her golden blonde locks were sticking up all over the place, like a cruel parody of the big hair you'd see in an 80s TV show.</p>
<p>"Hi," Lucy said, looking down at her feet. "I think I threw up last night. In a trash can."</p>
<p>"I left it there for you," I said.</p>
<p>"I thought so," Lucy said, "I don't remember a lot of last night."</p>
<p>"You got drunk," I said.</p>
<p>"Figured that part out," Lucy said. She pushed past me and then dropped onto my bed. I was pleased to see (and smell) that she was at least vomit-free. She snuggled into my pillows. "I hope I didn't do anything too embarrassing."</p>
<p>"You really don't remember?" I asked. I sat down next to her. My sister quickly shied away. Like I'd shocked her.</p>
<p>"I remember drinking a lot," she said, "Last night was hard. It was super uncomfortable to be around those people and realize they aren't our friends anymore. You know? Like, when we needed help, where were they? But when we throw a party, they all show up."</p>
<p>"I know," I said, "It was hard for me, too. Do you remember bringing me over to say 'hi' to Kara?"</p>
<p>"Sort of," Lucy said. She snuggled into my pillow more. "I remember Kara and I were talking, and she saw you. She said you'd gotten, like, super-hot. I'm sorry, Dylan. I thought about what you'd told me before. About how you'd think about her when we... It made me jealous. I know it shouldn't have. It's not fair, but it did."</p>
<p>"It's OK," I said, "I think I'd feel the same way if one of my friends was perving on you."</p>
<p>"Or if Randy Hotguy was at the party, putting the moves on me?" Lucy asked. She gave me a smirk and, despite it all, she looked so beautiful lying on my bed in the morning sun.</p>
<p>"Yeah, fuck that guy," I said.</p>
<p>"Well, I kinda couldn't handle it with Kara," Lucy said, "So I told myself it was funny, instead, and tried to make a whole joke out of it. And then you were flirting with her for real and I got really upset. Like, even more than before."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," I said, "I shouldn't have done that."</p>
<p>"Of course, you should have!" Lucy said, giving me a shove. "She's a hot girl and she's totally into you. You don't owe me anything, I'm your sister. I don't have any right to get in your way."</p>
<p>"Still, though," I said, "I could tell it was hurting your feelings."</p>
<p>"Yeah, so I went to go drink more after that," Lucy said, "And then I woke up in my own bed. I guess you helped me. I didn't, um, do anything else, did I? Nothing embarassing?"</p>
<p>I looked down at the hardwood floor. "You're fine," I said.</p>
<p>"Oh no," Lucy said, "I didn't hook up with some dude, did I? Or worse, one of our stupid, ugly cousins?"</p>
<p>"No, nothing like that," I said.</p>
<p>"Come on Dylan, what happened?"</p>
<p>"You don't remember any of it?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I swear I don't," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"I, um, well I found you sitting on the couch. And you kind of, um, propositioned me."</p>
<p>"Propo-wha?"</p>
<p>"You told me you wanted to have sex. With me. Right there."</p>
<p>"Oh shit."</p>
<p>"You were, um, kind of explicit, being honest," I said.</p>
<p>"Oh God, I'm so sorry," Lucy said, "Look, Dylan, that whole thing about 'truth-in-alcohol,' you know that's not true, right? Like, I don't want to. It's not that I don't think you're... Oh, Goddammit."</p>
<p>"It's OK," I said, "I get it. You were drunk. I knew it too. You don't have to explain yourself."</p>
<p>"But you didn't," Lucy said, "I mean, we didn't have sex."</p>
<p>"Even though I kind of forced myself on you?"</p>
<p>"Not gonna lie," I said, "You didn't make it easy." I intentionally eyed my sister's body and she immediately understood. "But no. I figured, if it was something you wanted, it could wait till we were both sober."</p>
<p>"Thanks Dylan," Lucy said. She sat up and kissed me on the cheek. All things considered, her breath wasn't all that bad. "I'm sorry I said those things to you. I shouldn't have. Look, I don't want to hurt your feelings. You know I care for you a lot. And what we've been doing, I mean, it's awesome. But we can't do that. No matter what I said in the moment."</p>
<p>"No, I get it."</p>
<p>"You're not mad?" Lucy asked.</p>
<p>"No, I agree," I said, "That's too far. Even for us."</p>
<p>"OK. Thanks. Seriously," Lucy said, "I know a lot of guys wouldn't... Anyway, I'm lucky to have you in my life."</p>
<p>"I'm lucky to have you, too."</p>
<p>We shared a quick, chaste hug. It felt nice to hold my curvy sister in my arms. I could feel myself responding so I stepped back. An erection was not at all appropriate for that moment.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go clean up," Lucy said as we broke. "I need to apologize to Lindsay for getting smashed on her birthday. Buy Mom and Dad a replacement trashcan. Make a fresh commitment to Jesus."</p>
<p>"I support your new life choices," I said.</p>
<p>Lucy got up and tousled my hair. "You should clean up, too," she said, "You look like crap."</p>
<p>Things slowly settled back into normal. Well, almost normal, in any case.</p>
<p>We spent the day cleaning the house -- it was quite an undertaking after the evening before. Lucy was clearly not the only person to have gotten a little out of hand.</p>
<p>As I was wiping down the dining room table, and my sisters all working on the living room, my mom pulled at my elbow. She motioned for me to join her in the kitchen. She looked very serious -- her mouth turned down like it was meant to make that shape.</p>
<p>"I saw what happened with you and your sister last night," Mom said.</p>
<p>"Mom, I can..."</p>
<p>"I just want you to know," Mom continued, breaking through me like a battering ram. "I'm really proud of you."</p>
<p>"Wait, what?"</p>
<p>"Lucy was way too drunk last night. You saw what was happening and stepped in. Took care of her."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," I said, "Yes, I did."</p>
<p>"You're a good brother," Mom said, "I know this has been hard on you. It's been rough on all of us. But throughout it all, I think you've managed to do the best with it. You've been steady, a rock the whole family can rely on."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Mom," I said. I hadn't realized that she saw me that way. I'd never thought about things from that perspective.</p>
<p>"You've given up a lot. I'd understand if you needed time, you know, to let your guard down, or whatever. Blow off some steam. But in the meantime, I want to thank you. For everything."</p>
<p>"It's fine," I said.</p>
<p>It truly was.</p>
<p>The next day marked the last week in August. My parents and Jan went back to work. Lindsay started going out with friends for her last, pre-high school, hurrahs. For our part, Lucy and I hung out but not like before. She insisted she didn't remember what had happened the night of the party, but the change in our relationship was there, just the same.</p>
<p>Finally, a full three days following the incident, my sister jutted her chin my way and we ended up in her bedroom. We didn't touch each other or speak; we went back to the basics. A quick press and that was it. But it felt like a breakthrough.</p>
<p>"Turns out being behaved is kind of boring," Lucy said with a shrug after we'd both peaked. I had to agree with her, of course. I assumed that was it, and we'd go back to this way of existing for a little while longer.</p>
<p>But something was different. The idea of intercourse had entered our minds. We'd joked about it before. Taunted and teased. Now though, it felt more like a when than an if. Even though neither of us would admit it to ourselves. Let alone each other.</p>
<p>I was walking past my sister's bedroom when I saw her. Lucy was wearing a pair of red, bikini cut panties, a yellow t-shirt, and nothing else. She was lying on her tummy on the floor, facing the far wall, her legs kicked up in the air. Golden hair pooled on the carpet. She had on her headphones, listening to music, and was lost to the world. But to me, in that moment, it looked exactly like she was pressing.</p>
<p>I don't know why I did it. Well, I know why. But not why that moment or why that way. I stepped into my sister's room. I knelt behind her. And before she became aware of my presence, I climbed on top of her, lowering my shorts-clad crotch onto her panty-covered bottom.</p>
<p>Lucy gasped, then stilled. I waited for her to throw me off, to tell me no, but she didn't. My older sister held in place. My hard-on poking into her perfect ass.</p>
<p>I took it as permission and pressed down. I heard Lucy gasp as the first bits of pleasure filled me. The softness of her bottom, the warmth of her body, it was perfect for what we were doing. My sister arched herself upward to meet my thrusts.</p>
<p>"Dylan," she said, and I knew that she was about to put a stop to this. I lifted myself off her ass. "This would be better with just underwear."</p>
<p>I froze. Obviously, I wasn't expecting that. I took off my shorts and tossed them to the side. Now in boxers, I leaned back down on top of my sister. Grinding down, I had to admit this did feel way better. The danger of it only amplifying what we were doing.</p>
<p>We lay like that, moving against each other. When we'd done this before, there had always been this sense of urgency. Even when we had all afternoon to get off, we always raced through.</p>
<p>This time, though, was different. We took our time. I don't know whether it was the position we were in, or the feelings we'd expressed, but we didn't rush. It was almost leisurely. The two of us slowly grinding against each other, savoring every sensation.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>But something else was also happening. The previously mentioned precarious nature of the fly of my boxers meant that, as I humped into my sister's ass, my penis was starting to pop free. I could feel the fabric of my sister's panties tickle the skin of my dick with each press.</p>
<p>Lucy must have felt it too. She reached back with her hand, stopping our coupling. I thought, once again, that she was drawing the line.</p>
<p>Instead, she pulled her panties down her legs and tossed them off. She lay back down on her tummy.</p>
<p>"Lucy, are you sure?" I asked. The argument roiled inside me; I could almost picture a chivalrous knight fighting a crazed barbarian. A funny metaphor for what I was feeling. And I'm sure you can figure out who was winning.</p>
<p>My sister tapped her headphones, as if to say that she couldn't hear me over her music. I supposed that was my answer. I took off my own underwear. Both of us were now naked from the waist down. I lay down on top of my sister. My cock nestled in that most precarious of places.</p>
<p>Bare skin to bare skin. I could feel the heat of her pussy, emanating out like a tiny sun. My hardness against her soft, wet spot. I didn't need to move; this was already beyond anything I'd ever felt.</p>
<p>But I did move. I pressed down. Lucy rubbed up at the same time. The two of us groaned in unison. We didn't need words. We humped against each other. Totally connected. Well, almost totally. Our bodies decided to fix that distinction for us.</p>
<p>The first time, the head of my penis grazed my sister's pussy so slightly, I hardly noticed.</p>
<p>The second time, my dick actually held for a moment, right at the entry to Lucy's pussy, before slipping away.</p>
<p>The third time, my cock actually went inside. No more than an inch. Barely the head of my head. And yet.</p>
<p>Both of us froze there. Right on the precipice of penetrative sex. I waited for my sister to tell me 'no.' I waited for my own conscience to cry out. None of that happened.</p>
<p>I pushed forward a little further. My older sister lifted her hips to ease my passage. My head snuck in. Halfway down my shaft. I pulled back. Thrust again. Lucy grunted. Finally, I was fully buried inside my sister's body.</p>
<p>For the first time since the process started, Lucy turned and looked back at me. Her expression was unreadable -- a mix of total joy and absolute concern. Fear, desire, sadness, exultation. All in one. I was feeling it too.</p>
<p>I drew back slightly, then pushed forward. My sister's face twisted as the sensation overtook her. Eyes rolled back. Lips curled. She turned forward, resting her head on her arms.</p>
<p>We rolled against each other. Together, truly, for the first time. I heard Lucy make all those familiar noises I'd known from before -- the little gasps and groans. Squeaks and mewls. But now they were coming because of me.</p>
<p>"So good," she gasped.</p>
<p>I couldn't respond, already wrapped up in my own pleasure. The heat of my sister's pussy, her warmth and wetness, it was like nothing I'd ever experienced. Amplifying everything from simple sex to something beyond what we have words for. Intimate beyond intimacy.</p>
<p>I was fucking my sister. I couldn't get past that fact. It was integral to the experience. The wrongness of what we were doing. The rightness of it. Everything about the physical act was overwhelmed by the emotional part of it.</p>
<p>I reached my hands down and found my sister's amazing breasts. Over her shirt, was still more than enough. I squeezed those massive mounds, using them like handholds, as I humped my sister from behind. I didn't ever want this to end.</p>
<p>"Getting... close," Lucy said. Her voice strained. God, I wanted her to cum so bad. But her words had a secondary effect.</p>
<p>"Me too," I said. I was very aware, then, of what we were doing. Had done. The consequences racing towards me, but I couldn't look away.</p>
<p>"Don't stop," Lucy said.</p>
<p>Our movements became frenzied. Moving in synchronicity; racing in opposite directions -- Lucy trying frantically to reach her orgasm, me trying desperately to escape mine.</p>
<p>"Don't stop," Lucy said it again. "Don't you dare stop."</p>
<p>"Trying..."</p>
<p>Lucy's body undulated under me. Even though I was on top, she was clearly in control. She arched and shimmied. Rubbed and cinched. Moved her body on my cock like I was only an object. Faster. Faster.</p>
<p>Finally, she stopped. Stilled.</p>
<p>"Ohhhhh" the word slipped out of her like steam. Pitch rising till it left my spectrum.</p>
<p>I'd seen Lucy's orgasm so many times, I could replay it in detail on the back of my eyelids. Heard it so often, I could write it as a symphony. Even smelled it, her femininity filling my nostrils as she flooded.</p>
<p>But I'd never felt my sister's cum before.</p>
<p>Her pussy clamped down, sealing shut like it was one of those vacuum storage bags. Air tight. Her butt slammed downward. Her back arched. We don't need to invent a cock-milking machine. My sister already has the perfect one built in.</p>
<p>"Lucy, I'm..." My inner knight took one final, desperate swing.</p>
<p>"Dooooon't. Stooooop," Lucy said, a low deep rumble I could barely make out.</p>
<p>It didn't matter what she'd said. It was already too late. The pleasant tingle in my penis turned into a spark, racing fire down my shaft and straight into my sister's unprotected pussy.</p>
<p>I let out a long, strangled cry. A river of sperm burst into my sister's snatch, while an ocean of illicit bliss rolled over my body. I jammed my dick as deep as it would go. Squeezed Lucy's breasts so hard, there would be bruises after. Pressed as hard as I could as plume after plume of pleasure arced out of me.</p>
<p>Vaguely, I was aware of the sister beneath me, enduring her own ecstasy. She told me after, feeling my hot cum splash against her cervix had triggered a chain reaction, taking her already extant orgasm and exacerbating it. Like pumping gasoline into a fire.</p>
<p>Lucy burst. Her brain blew out. Her body shivered and shook. Wordless, primal sounds escaped her lips. She came like she was crazed by it. Like I'd unlocked the higher function of her pleasure centers. Both of us awash in the chemicals of reproduction. Oxytocin and dopamine. Endorphins and adrenaline.</p>
<p>My cock finally gave up trying to find more cum to pump into my sister's fertile pussy. It didn't shrink, so much as it lay down, exhausted. Lucy's body went limp. I fell with her. Her soft skin felt almost too hot. We rolled off each other, sweaty.</p>
<p>"Oh fuck," Lucy said. I couldn't tell if it was in celebration or regret. Maybe a bit of both.</p>
<p>She rolled over and sat up. Absently, she dipped her fingers in her pussy. They came out covered in white goop.</p>
<p>"Oh fuck," she said it again. "Oh, fuck me."</p>
<p>Reality raced over me. That post-cum rationality burst forth. What we did. What we'd done. Whatever post-sex satisfaction I had earned was obliterated by guilt. I'd just had sex with my sister. Committed incest. Inseminated her unprotected pussy. All of it. My most forbidden dream. My totally enrapturing nightmare.</p>
<p>"Lucy, I'm sorry," I said, "I didn't mean to." My apology felt so stupid in my own mouth, I couldn't imagine how idiotic I sounded to my sister.</p>
<p>Lucy didn't say anything. She rolled over and held me tight, like cradling a crying baby. Her bare bottom pressed against mine. I felt a stream of my own semen drip out of her pussy and land, warm, on my thigh. The tickle of her pubic hair on my rapidly shrinking cock.</p>
<p>"It's OK," Lucy said, shushing me. "It's alright."</p>
<p>We stayed like that, half naked in her bedroom, holding each other close for as long as we could. Neither of us knowing what to say. What to do.</p>
<p>Staring down a suddenly very uncertain future.</p>


<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>Welcome to part TWO of the Pressing Matters series!</p>
<p>Last time, Dylan and his older sister Lucy started masturbating together. Things got out of control and there were consequences. Have the siblings learned their lesson? (clearly not)</p>
<p>And yes, I'm well aware that this is the second story I've written around Thanksgiving. I guess there's something about turkey that I find something truly erotic.</p>
<p>All participants are over the age of 18.</p>
<p>"Hey, come here."</p>
<p>My sister, Lucy, and I were lying on the floor of her bedroom. Lucy had a pillow under her, slightly folded so it was pressing at her crotch. I was on the bare ground, grinding my groin into the hardwood floor like doing a cobra pose in yoga. My body trembled with effort. Both of us must have looked so silly, our faces red with effort. Eyes glazed over and oddly empty.</p>
<p>Our youngest sister, Lindsay, stood at the opening of Lucy's room, staring at us with a mix of shock and curiosity. Our eighteen-year-old sister was thin, with brown hair hanging down to her waist. She was wearing her standard outfit of a tank top and yoga pants. Her arms crossed under her barely-there breasts.</p>
<p>"Come here," Lucy said to our sister. "Try this. It feels really good."</p>
<p>My older sister and I had spent our entire summer doing this. We called it pressing. Lucy -- blonde and buxom, two years my elder -- had started it. But I was a no less willing participant. We would hang out in the house like normal, then sneak off to her bedroom to hump the floor. For three straight months, we did it at least once a day and sometimes way more than that.</p>
<p>It was just dry humping. Even when we started doing it on top of each other, it felt mostly chaste. But one fateful afternoon, I took things too far.</p>
<p>Lucy had been lying on the floor of her bedroom. Her body so curvy and inviting. It had been an accident, at first, when my bare dick slipped into my older sister. But we kept fucking very much on purpose.</p>
<p>That probably would have been our new routine. Both of us agreed that it felt amazing. Except for one problem. We lost control (even more than we already had, believe it or not) and I ejaculated inside her.</p>
<p>Lucy wasn't on birth control. Our family's recent financial downturn had meant giving up a lot of necessities and apparently the pill was one of them. We spent an anxious month, and no small amount of our skimpy savings, on pregnancy tests. Thankfully, inexplicably, my boys managed to miss the target. Lucy's period showed up right on schedule.</p>
<p>But the reality of what we'd done -- I'd inseminated my own sister's unprotected pussy -- was the best form of birth control we'd ever encountered. Just like that, the sexy times stopped. No pressing. No nothing.</p>
<p>Other things got in the way, as well. We both were fully into our college classes by then. We made new friends at school. Life continued on. But none of that would have mattered if we'd really wanted to go back to our old ways. And we didn't.</p>
<p>September turned to October, the leaves went from green to orange/red, but my sister and I stayed away from each other. What had happened, what we'd almost created, was enough to scare us straight. I assumed forever.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, as November arrived and brought the icy winds of impending winter with it, our previous thaw began to melt away. One day, I caught Lucy pressing in her bedroom, door wide open, and decided to join her. A few hours later, Lucy found me in my own room, and we did it again. Without talking about it, without ever making a conscious choice, we were right back to our old routine.</p>
<p>The rest of the family didn't notice any of our trials and tribulations. Our older sister, Jan, was working full time and then some. So were my mom and dad. Our younger sister, Lindsay -- who'd turned eighteen a week before our 'incestuous almost-impregnation incident' -- was so swept up in her senior year of high school, I doubt she'd have noticed if Lucy and I were cooking meth in her bedroom.</p>
<p>Except, she did notice. Because Lucy decided to call Lindsay's attention right to us.</p>
<p>Like I said, we were lying on the floor of Lucy's bedroom, doing our usual afternoon press after classes and before we had to make dinner. Lucy had left her door open, but I didn't think anything of it until our skinny, brunette sister walked past, then froze in our doorway.</p>
<p>I started to say something, but the embarrassment of it stuffed the words back in my throat. Fortunately, Lucy was conscious enough to save the day.</p>
<p>"Hey, come here," Lucy said.</p>
<p>Seriously, we were so lucky that my older sister was able to think on her feet and ensure that Lindsay didn't... Wait. WHAT?! The reality didn't so much dawn on me as it steamrolled me right over. Did Lucy just invite our younger sister to join us?!</p>
<p>Lindsay stood in the doorway, staring like she was seeing two horny ghosts. She had to know what we were doing. My little sister was innocent sometimes, but she wasn't stupid.</p>
<p>"Seriously, it feels really good," Lucy said. The way our older sister was so casual about this was maybe the strangest part of all.</p>
<p>"I don't know..." Lindsay said.</p>
<p>"Tell her, Dylan," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"It's nice," I said, unable to get much more vocabulary out than that. Remember, I was mid-hump when Lindsay had interrupted us. And while my mind had gotten an ice bath of epic proportions, the message had yet to make it to the rest of my body.</p>
<p>My younger sister was certainly cute. She was petite, skinny, with an elfin face and an adorable smile. Lindsay was one of those artsy, granola types -- all about health and wellness. She'd been vegan since she was twelve and did barre at least three times a week. And so even though she wasn't curvy at all, she was nicely defined. Especially her pert, bubble butt.</p>
<p>"Get in here," Lucy said. Her demand was ridiculous, but it did the trick. Lindsay scampered into Lucy's bedroom like she was the one who'd been caught doing something naughty. "Grab a pillow off my bed."</p>
<p>Lindsay did as she was told. She found an empty space on the floor, her head meeting ours in the middle, and placed the pillow in the spot where her groin would rub against it. I was too entranced by what was going on to go back to my own ministrations. I noticed Lucy seemed equally enthralled.</p>
<p>Our younger sister wiggled her backside as she settled onto the cushion.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's it," Lucy said as Lindsay's perky butt settled down. "Like that."</p>
<p>"Uh huh," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>She looked so serious, it was almost funny. My younger sister wriggled around a bit more, then froze.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Lindsay squeaked in surprise.</p>
<p>"See?" Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Uhn." Lindsay grunted. "Uh huh."</p>
<p>Her sister clearly settled, Lucy got back to her own grinding. For a moment, I lay there and stared as both my sisters humped the pillows on the floor. It was hard to pick who was more exciting to watch.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Lucy's curvy body screamed sex. Her massive tits and wide hips. But then Lindsay's lithe little body was no less alluring. And this was the first time I'd ever seen her like this. She had these little trembles, like small seizures, as she slid against the pillow on the floor.</p>
<p>Lucy got my attention and, wordlessly, made it clear that I needed to stop staring. I realized she was right. If Lindsay caught me looking this stopped being something we were sharing and became more of a performance. This magical, masturbation bubble we'd created would *pop* like a balloon on a hot day.</p>
<p>I quickly focused on my own pleasure. It didn't take long for me to build back to where I was before. I did my best, however, to hold myself back from the big finish. I wanted the girls to go first.</p>
<p>Lucy was the first to peak. I heard her now-familiar low, throaty groan as she took herself over the top. Eyes rolled back in her head.</p>
<p>"That's... it..." the words squeezed out of her like she was a strange, buxom accordion</p>
<p>A moment later, Lindsay let out a cute little squeak.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she cried out, her whole body shaking like she'd been shocked. Tongue lolled out of her mouth. Finally, she collapsed, lifeless, to the floor. She let out a long, soft, "Ahhhhhhhh."</p>
<p>After that, I figured it was safe for me to spend and so I did. The pleasure arced through me in short, sharp spurts as hot jets of semen spattered in my shorts. I rolled onto my back and stared up at Lucy's ceiling. Her floor so strangely comfortable.</p>
<p>"Nice right?" Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Yeah..." Lindsay said, dreamily.</p>
<p>I assumed, stupidly, that that would be the end of things. I don't know why I thought the three of us would do it that one time and Lindsay would be done with it. I don't know how I could have so easily mistaken an entrance for an exit.</p>
<p>Still, you can see there's a certain logic to my thinking. After all, if you were asked to list the most likely occurrences in my life, regular masturbation sessions with two of my sisters would have been pretty low, right? Probably buried somewhere between 'get my own unicorn' and 'find a million bucks abandoned on the sidewalk.' And yet, that's exactly what happened, with the kind of casual inevitability that usually accompanies events like 'tuna sandwich for lunch.'</p>
<p>That very evening there was a knock on my bedroom door. I was lying in bed, watching something dumb on my phone, and starting to get good and sleepy. So, I was surprised by the sound, to say the least. I was wearing a pair of pajama pants and nothing else, so I pulled on a t-shirt before I answered.</p>
<p>My parents were both passed out and Jan, my oldest sister, was out with friends. Lucy, the most likely candidate to be bothering me at that hour, was never so overt as to knock on my door. She'd find some other way to get my attention if she needed it. There was only one other person it could be: my little sister Lindsay. But that didn't make any sense either, we didn't have that kind of relationship. Yet when I opened the door, there she was -- wearing a frilly, sleeveless sleep shirt and staring at me in the near-darkness.</p>
<p>If her appearance was a shock, you can only imagine my reaction to what Lindsay did next. She went across the hall and knocked on Lucy's door. My curvy, blonde sister opened it, looking at both of us like we were the world's weirdest Jehovah's witnesses.</p>
<p>"I want to do it again," Lindsay said, acting exactly like the young, petulant sibling she was.</p>
<p>In an evening of unexpected events, this was the one I was probably the least prepared for. I was no stranger to a late-night press with Lucy. We'd been doing that for months. But neither of us had ever spoken about it aloud. That was straight up crazy. Who came out and invited someone, verbally, to a mutual masturbation session?</p>
<p>I looked over at my older sister. Lucy was wearing a simple t-shirt and shorts. Her eyebrows were raised in confusion. Her mouth, however, slipped into a smirk. Without another word, the buxom blonde girl motioned for the both of us to join her in her bedroom.</p>
<p>Just like that, as if this was an everyday occurrence, Lucy closed her door behind us, tossed her younger sister a spare pillow, and flopped onto the floor.</p>
<p>Not long after, the three of us cascaded into our personally supplied orgasms. This time, I was the first to go. I think the whole scenario had me worked up more than usual. As I went over the top, the heat of my spend shooting down my bare legs, I felt at least one pair of eyes on me. I assumed it was my younger sister, Lindsay, but it might have been my older sister, Lucy. Or maybe both.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know. In the moment, I didn't care. It just added another level to the already high peak I was reaching.</p>
<p>"That's so hot." I heard my baby sister whisper through the haze of my post-orgasm ecstasy.</p>
<p>"I know, right?" Lucy said.</p>
<p>A moment later, the room filled with the low groans and sharp gasps of my sisters cumming, themselves. I was too fogged out to notice who did what. Not that it made the experience any less alluring.</p>
<p>An arm bumped against my body as Lindsay settled in next to me. Lucy's leg kicked against mine. All three of us lay there on the floor, warm and post-cum cozy.</p>
<p>The next time I blinked, I saw it was 3am. I peeled myself off the wood floor and limped back to my bedroom. My leg hairs sticky with dried cum.</p>
<p>The next day, Lucy volunteered to drive the three of us to school.</p>
<p>"Dylan and I are both going to County and Lindsay's high school is kinda on the way," she explained to my parents as we packed up our things that morning. "Besides, I want to help you guys out more if I can."</p>
<p>"That's very sweet of you," Mom said.</p>
<p>"We really appreciate it," Dad said.</p>
<p>Jan stood in the kitchen, arms crossed primly, eyeing the three of us like she was sure we were all spies.</p>
<p>We piled into my older sister's sad Honda Civic -- Lindsay in the front with Lucy, me in the backseat -- and drove off. We hadn't even left the driveway before Lindsay started into it.</p>
<p>"Last night was a lot of fun," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>I felt the air leave the car. My stomach twisted. Like I said, Lucy and I had been pressing regularly all summer. So masturbating with my siblings, didn't feel that different. But we definitely didn't ever talk about it. That was the act of an insane person.</p>
<p>"I'm glad," Lucy said, calmly. Her clipped response was a clear 'be quiet,' but Lindsay didn't hear it.</p>
<p>"I think we should do it again," Lindsay said, "Maybe this afternoon when we all get back from school."</p>
<p>"OK, honey," Lucy said, patting our younger sister on her skinny leg.</p>
<p>After we dropped Lindsay off, I climbed into the front seat with Lucy, and we drove off toward County.</p>
<p>"What was all that about?" I asked, pulling on my seatbelt.</p>
<p>"What?" Lucy said, slightly distracted.</p>
<p>"You know with the," I began, fumbling for the words. Did I really need to explain this? "The afternoon. And stuff."</p>
<p>"Let her be enthusiastic," Lucy said, smiling at me placatingly. "It's fun."</p>
<p>I shrugged, but inside I was still sullen. It's not that I was upset that Lindsay was involved in our thing. Like I said, it was kind of nice to have a new participant. But the way she was so open about it? That made it all weird and I didn't like it.</p>
<p>I comforted myself that it was just conversation. As long as we quietly went about pressing, I supposed I could live with a little chatter.</p>
<p>"I want to see your thing," Lindsay said. She beamed at me, broadly. Like a kid asking for a lollipop at the supermarket.</p>
<p>We were all in the living room after school. Unlike usual, when Lindsay would spend all afternoon lounging around at some friend's house, she'd hurried straight home. I was done with my classes for the day, and I'd camped out on the couch while Lucy brought our sister home from school</p>
<p>I'd been watching TV, coming down from the day, when our youngest sister rushed right into the house, threw down her things, then tossed a pillow onto the floor. She didn't even bother to say hello.</p>
<p>"Well?" she asked, staring up at me, impatiently.</p>
<p>I turned to Lucy, standing in the doorway. We shared a look somewhere between impressed, apprehensive, and excited. I don't know if even Lucy had anticipated that involving our baby sister would bring us to this point. Our illicit activities had already felt risky without Lindsay's incredible enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Still, we flopped to the floor. The three of us crowded so close together we had to shift so our elbows wouldn't collide as we pressed. We'd barely even begun when Lindsay took things up yet another notch.</p>
<p>"Fuck that feels good," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>OK, so a little dirty talk during wasn't all that new. Lucy and I, when we were in the full throes of our self-pleasure summer, had started doing the same thing. We hadn't gotten back to it since our autumn restart, but it made sense that we would try again at some point.</p>
<p>But Lindsay wasn't idly talking to turn herself on.</p>
<p>"Fuck, I want to see it," she said.</p>
<p>"You are seeing it," I said. I did my best gesture at how the three of us were getting off in plain sight.</p>
<p>"Not this," Lindsay said. She looked pointedly at my crotch. "That. I want to see your thing. While we do it. That would be so hot."</p>
<p>I turned to my older sister. Lucy shrugged at me. I couldn't read her expression at all. Lindsay's look, however, I understood implicitly.</p>
<p>"Take it out, Dylan," my baby sister said, twisting her hair in her fingers. "I bet Lucy wants to see it, too."</p>
<p>I assumed Lucy would be the levelheaded one, although I can't imagine why. I mean, all the evidence I had was that my older sister was equally as crazed as my younger. But, for some reason, I continued to assume that Lucy was going to put the brakes on things. Instead, she did exactly what I should have anticipated by now.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Dylan, show us your cock," Lucy said, "Stroke it for us."</p>
<p>Well, I wasn't one to let down my sisters. I got off the floor and sat on the couch. I was about to slip off my pants, but I stopped. Through the haze of my sibling-induced arousal, I managed to have a moment of inspiration.</p>
<p>"You have to show me something, too," I said.</p>
<p>Both girls paused. They turned to look at each other, eyes searching. As I've said, my two siblings looked very different. Lucy was full and curvy. Her face was on the round side with full lips and a slightly upturned nose. Lindsay, on the other hand, was all angles. She had a sharp chin and a thin mouth -- almost the opposite of her older sister, really. And yet, in that moment where they glanced at each other, my sisters looked so much alike, it was uncanny. Their blood relation abundantly clear.</p>
<p>"Tops," Lucy said, and Lindsay nodded her head.</p>
<p>Both girls reached for their shirts and bras then tossed them aside. They were still on their stomachs with me sitting above them, so I didn't get a full glimpse. It didn't matter. The grandeur of the view -- it was like eyeing the Andes and the Himalayas all at once.</p>
<p>I'd seen Lucy's full, glorious boobs before, but that didn't make them any less amazing. They were so large, yet perfectly formed. There was something inherently unreal about them, as if such wonders could only exist in fiction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was getting my first glimpse at Lindsay's little mounds, and they were no less incredible for being so much smaller than her sister's. Lindsay's tiny tits were incredibly perky, almost sharp with light pink nipples.</p>
<p>My sisters made the exact same 'ahem.' Both girls had been looking at me expectantly for a while, but can you blame me for not noticing? They shared a knowing, goofy grin.</p>
<p>I took the hint and pulled down my jeans and boxers. My dick popped out, eager. Whatever softness I might have needed to press on the floor was lost in the excitement of everything else. I was as hard as I'd ever been, like I'd installed my own personal coatrack.</p>
<p>If I'd stared a bit too long at my sisters' chests, they more than made up for it by the way they ogled my dick, entranced. Lindsay's mouth hung open, her eyes wide. Lucy's own blue orbs sparkled; her mouth twisted into a hungry grin.</p>
<p>"Ahem," I said, mimicking my sisters.</p>
<p>"Just give us a minute," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, don't rush us," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>"Fine," I said. I felt so on display, my dick somehow both flagged and flag-poled harder at the same time.</p>
<p>Finally, my sisters settled back in and started to rub themselves on the floor. They kept their heads tilted upwards, though, staring at my cock.</p>
<p>"Stroke it, Dylan," Lucy said, "Get off with us."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I want to see it shoot," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>I did as I was told, as if I needed the encouragement. Watching both my topless sisters hump the floor, their bare tits trembling, was more than enough to make me want to work myself. The way they seemed to be enamored of my erection only increased the urge. It was like being told to have a heartbeat -- it was going to happen no matter what they said.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>I grabbed my dick and started stroking it. I hadn't masturbated in this way in so long, the sensation was almost foreign. The oddly unfamiliar feeling only increased my arousal at that moment.</p>
<p>With everything going on, it didn't take long for me to reach my peak. I grunted as the pleasure raced up my shaft, exploding across my body. My first burst of cum arced onto Lindsay's back. I expected my skinny sister to be grossed out, but instead she giggled as the warm liquid splattered her.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's so awesome," she said, staring wide eyed at my dick. My next shot hit her again and she writhed.</p>
<p>"Give me some of that," Lucy said. She arched upwards, presenting her massive tits as my target.</p>
<p>I was barely able to move at that point, wrapped in my rapture, but I did my best to aim my dick and managed to splat my sister's boobs (to be fair, they were hard to miss). I kept cumming between my sisters, till finally, I fell back into the couch.</p>
<p>Lindsay was the next to go, shuddering and shaking in that cute way of hers. She let out several sharp, high-pitched gasps as she gave in to the pleasure. Already her orgasm was so familiar.</p>
<p>Finally, Lucy went off with a deep grunt. Her head tipped forward. Blue eyes rolled back in her head. She let out a long "Ahhhhhhhh" as the ecstasy slowly leaked out of her.</p>
<p>The three of us lay in the living room for a while, staring at the walls. Finally, Lindsay popped up off the floor.</p>
<p>"That was awesome," she said, "But I think you got some in my hair."</p>
<p>"Sorry," I said, still in post-orgasm stupor. "You have a lot. Of hair."</p>
<p>Lindsay pulled her long, brown locks around her and stared at them, picking at all the sticky spots. She'd stayed topless and there was something incredibly sexy about how the strands covered her tiny tits.</p>
<p>"I think you got some on my boobs, too," Lucy said, grinning at me lasciviously. She lifted up one of her massive mounds and eyed it, mirroring her sister.</p>
<p>"To be fair, you have a lot of tits," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>Lucy laughed and conceded that that was true. I stayed on the couch, looking dumbfounded at what I had wrought and wondering what else could possibly happen next. In some ways, we'd already gone farther than what Lucy and I had done in the summer. And that had ended so badly. I couldn't bear the thought of it happening again.</p>
<p>But I couldn't entertain the idea of stopping any of this either.</p>
<p>That night at dinner, my parents announced our plans for Thanksgiving the following week, which were unsurprisingly low key. Mom was going to get a couple of roast chickens from Costco, and we were going to stay around the house, all six of us.</p>
<p>"Your Aunt Becky invited us to her place but that's a six-hour drive," Dad said, "And the gas money is out of our budget."</p>
<p>We all agreed that it wasn't worth the extra expense.</p>
<p>"Actually," Lucy said, "My friend Kara is going to be back from school, and I was hoping she could join us. Her parents are away at some ski resort thing."</p>
<p>"Which one is Kara?" Dad asked, "I don't think I remember her."</p>
<p>"Daaad," Lucy whined, "You know Kara. We've been friends for, like, ever."</p>
<p>"If you say so," Dad said, with a dismissive shrug.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, remembered Kara quite well. She was my older sister's best friend, and I had a bit of a crush on her. We'd had an 'encounter' at Lindsay's birthday party and Lucy had gotten upset, drunk, and horny all in succession. I was both incredibly excited and extremely nervous at the thought of seeing that girl again.</p>
<p>"Kara's more than welcome to join us," Mom said, "But make sure she knows things are going to be modest."</p>
<p>"Oh, she'll just be happy to have the company," Lucy said. She gave me a strange look that I couldn't read. What was my older sister up to, exactly?</p>
<p>After dinner, we cleaned up and then the family watched TV in the living room. Thinking about what had happened earlier that day on that couch made me paranoid about what might have been left behind, but no one seemed to notice. Instead, we all sat there, acting normal, as if half the family wasn't having incestuous circle jerks behind the other half's back.</p>
<p>Our show ended. One by one, my family went off to bed, leaving me and Lindsay.</p>
<p>"That was fun this afternoon," Lindsay said, casually, after Jan went upstairs. "I loved seeing you shoot off like that."</p>
<p>I looked at my sister in shock. Was she out of her mind randomly talking about that stuff in the living room? Anyone could have heard her, yet she said it like she was talking about a sandwich I'd made, rather than about how I'd spread my mayo all over her back.</p>
<p>"What?" Lindsay said, reacting to my expression.</p>
<p>"We're not supposed to talk about it."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean why..." I paused, so flustered I couldn't find words. "Because it's not appropriate."</p>
<p>"So, it's OK to do it, but not to talk about it?" Lindsay asked.</p>
<p>"Exactly," I said. Alright, so maybe I was twisted up in my own argument there.</p>
<p>"That doesn't make any sense," Lindsay said. She folded her arms around her little chest, pouty.</p>
<p>I shrugged. Someone had to be the keeper of propriety here. My little sister's enthusiasm was fun, yes, but she was going to get us all in trouble.</p>
<p>"Look -- what we're doing," I said, "We shouldn't be doing it, right?"</p>
<p>"Why not?" Lindsay asked that question again. Like it was the height of philosophical dialectic.</p>
<p>"We're. I mean it's. Fuck." Language was leaving me so fast, I could only grasp at the words as they raced past me. It left me with a frantic, meaningless ramble.</p>
<p>"It feels good," Lindsay said, "And it's fun. So, I don't see a problem. I mean, you're not stopping, right?"</p>
<p>I had to concede all of that.</p>
<p>"And if it's OK to do then it must be OK to talk about, too," Lindsay said, "Right?"</p>
<p>I struggled to refute her logic, even though it didn't actually make any sense.</p>
<p>"I've been learning a lot about my chakras," Lindsay said, "They're these elements of energy inside of us that we can harness in order to be more whole, happier beings. When we inhibit the flow of that energy, that's where anger and unhappiness come from."</p>
<p>"Right," I said, making my disdain clear. My sister was into all kinds of hippy dippy stuff like that, most of which I assumed came from vaping too much pot with her friends. Of course, the exercise part of it had an amazing impact on her body, so I wasn't complaining too much.</p>
<p>"Chakras feed into all kinds of things -- my desires, my emotions, my ability control myself and my life. I feel very in tune with myself when we press together. Completely immersed in the flow of us. It's very enlightening."</p>
<p>Enlightening. Self-induced orgasms with her siblings. Got it.</p>
<p>"I'm a human being with physical wants," Lindsay said, "I'm not going to make myself feel bad about something that feels so good. And you shouldn't either, OK?"</p>
<p>I looked at my pretty little sister. Her bright, green eyes so soft and caring. The cute smile playing on her thin lips. She eyed me in a way that made me feel cared for, safe, in a crazed world. Our lives had been so upside down the last few years and yet Lindsay had found a way to find order in that chaos.</p>
<p>Besides, if I won this argument, exactly what was going to be my prize? Would we stop pressing? I wasn't that stupid.</p>
<p>So, I agreed with my younger sister. "Yes," I said, "OK."</p>
<p>"Good," Lindsay said. She clapped her hands, happily. "Because I want to see your thing shoot again. That was awesome."</p>
<p>After Lindsay took her little tits out of her tank top, I was more than happy to oblige. This time, I showered her chest with my seed. She bounced up and down like it was the world's greatest magic trick.</p>
<p>"Holy fuck that's so hot," she said, rubbing my spend into her tiny pink nipples. I assumed she'd want to rub one out herself, but instead my little sister just skipped off to bed. I stared after her, trying to figure out how I'd gotten tangled up, unable to find my way back to reality.</p>
<p>Despite our new dedication to open discussion, the next week passed without much excitement. We all hunkered down for exams before the break, I think, and it took away most of our energy. The three of us pressed together a few times, but it was a quick thing with none of the 'performance' of our earlier sessions.</p>
<p>Then break started and we got caught up in prepping for Thanksgiving. Despite my mom's insistence that everything was going to be as cheap and easy as possible, we still ended up spending all our time on cooking and cleaning. The fact that we were having a guest, I think, made Mom feel way more self-conscious about how we were living.</p>
<p>The house we were renting was old, almost certainly haunted, and it collected dust everywhere -- like someone was using a sifter of sand in every room when we weren't looking. It made every cleaning project an extra chore, more like exhuming a body than keeping our own living quarters clean.</p>
<p>But we did our best to stay cheerful as we went through it. Holidays were particularly stressful with everything that had happened, so we all worked extra hard to keep each other engaged.</p>
<p>Finally, Thanksgiving Day arrived. The table was set. The dog show was onscreen. We were all ready to settle in for a day of overindulging in food, alcohol, and television.</p>
<p>Kara arrived shortly before 2pm, even her knock on the door was bubbly and cheerful. Lucy hurried over to answer it, and immediately embraced her petite friend in a hug so big, it threatened to swallow the girl.</p>
<p>My sister finally released Kara, and the brunette immediately caught my eye. Reflexively, I stared down at my shoes. Kara was super cute. She was petite with dark brown hair and a tight little body. Her build was kind of like my younger sister, Lindsay, although she was skinny, rather than lithe or toned.</p>
<p>The last time we'd met up, at Lindsay's birthday party, Kara had given me her number. We'd texted a few times, but mostly it went nowhere. Now I was regretting the lost opportunity. With her deep brown eyes and wicked smirk, Kara was very much in my crush category. All the sibling masturbation sessions couldn't quench that fire.</p>
<p>Kara walked over and gave me a light kiss on the cheek. I looked immediately at Lucy, waiting for the jealousy monster to leap out from her lips, but instead my older sister just grinned at me. Like she knew a really good secret.</p>
<p>Soon after, we sat down to the meal. There was enough food for all, but I would never have described it as a sumptuous feast. Weird how even our indulgences were a reminder of all the things we could no longer indulge in.</p>
<p>Everything started OK. My Dad asked Kara how school was going, and she did a good job keeping things light. My sisters chimed in, and we were having a pretty good time. But then one innocuous question stopped everything dead.</p>
<p>"So where are your parents during the holiday?" Mom asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, they're off at the ski resort," Kara said.</p>
<p>"Ski resort," my dad said. It was not a question.</p>
<p>"Yes, it was this whole thing," Kara said, "Dad said that money was tight, so he reserved at this place that isn't as nice as usual and Mom freaked out."</p>
<p>"Yes," Dad said, "Important to be financially responsible."</p>
<p>The room went dead silent. I think Kara realized what she'd been saying, but it was too late. The cloud of our family's failures hung over us, thick and murky. I felt it, heavy, in my chest.</p>
<p>We'd been those people, once. Never as rich as Kara, of course, but doing well enough to have a nice home, new cars, and a good vacation. Dad didn't set out to lose his job, we all knew that, but it happened anyway. Suddenly we were scraping by.</p>
<p>Dad had found another job for about a quarter of the pay. Mom went back to work and Jan cut grad school short to start earning money. The only reason Lucy and I weren't working was because Dad insisted that school was more important and wouldn't allow it. Watching him gather up those last shreds of his pride was almost worse than seeing it obliterated in the first place.</p>
<p>So, hearing Kara talk about having to accept the 'lesser' chalet while we stared at two sad, skinny chickens at a busted up table in a sad, old house -- I guess it hurt a little. With conversation stifled and the meal mostly gone, we turned to the one thing we still had plenty of: alcohol.</p>
<p>We'd ended up with a half dozen bottles of wine and we proceeded to methodically murder them all. It didn't make dinner less awkward, but it helped us remember less of it in the morning.</p>
<p>After dinner, the inevitable began to take its effect. My Dad found his way to the football game and Jan joined him. Mom ended up napping in a corner. That left Lindsay, Lucy, Kara and I to sloppily clean up.</p>
<p>At one point, while I collected the dishes and Kara and Lindsay were washing in the other room, Lucy sidled up next to me, nudging my side.</p>
<p>"Kara's been eyeing you all night," she said.</p>
<p>"That's nice," I said, absently.</p>
<p>"You should make a move," Lucy said, "I think she'd go for it."</p>
<p>"Last time, that did not turn out too well," I said, looking at my sister meaningfully.</p>
<p>"It's fine," Lucy said, "I won't get mad."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Lucy said, "Kara's a nice girl and she could do a lot worse. Besides, I feel like one of us should score on Thanksgiving, since it looks like the Cowboys can't do it."</p>
<p>"Thanks," I said, meaning it.</p>
<p>Our lives had been so cursed, dating hadn't felt like an option. And while I enjoyed my little meetings with my sisters, they also put me in an uncomfortable spot for other relationships. What had happened when I flirted with Kara last time, I was not going through that again. So having the green light from my sister left my engines revving hard.</p>
<p>Once we were done cleaning up, I made my way over to Kara. I was about to suggest she come see my room for some lame reason (it was the best excuse I could think of), but Lindsay beat me to the punch.</p>
<p>"We should do something," my little sister said, "The rest of the family is busy, so let's hang out."</p>
<p>"That could be fun, I guess," I said, mentally cursing my cock-blocking baby sis.</p>
<p>"We could play a boardgame," Kara said, "I think I saw some in one of the bedrooms before."</p>
<p>"Oh hell no," Lucy said, "That's only going to lead to trouble."</p>
<p>"What if we did our thing?" Lindsay suggested.</p>
<p>Both Lucy and I swung our heads toward our sister so fast, I'm surprised our necks didn't snap in unison. What did she just say?!</p>
<p>"I don't think that's a good idea, hon," Lucy said, taking the side of reason for once.</p>
<p>"I bet Kara would really like it," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>Oh my God. I was going to grab my sister's chakra and wrap it around her neck. I knew we'd all probably overconsumed, but as far as I could tell, Lindsay was suggesting this soberly. This was beyond a disaster; it was a twenty-car pileup with a nuclear-powered van in the middle of the wreck. Everything was on fire, irradiated, and melting down to the atoms.</p>
<p>"Is this some game you guys play?" Kara asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah, ha ha, a game," I said. I took Kara's arm and started to steer her away. "Come on, I want to show you this cool thing I've got up in my bedroom."</p>
<p>"Yes, Dylan's bedroom is a great idea," Lindsay said. "OW!"</p>
<p>I looked over in surprise and saw that Lucy had pinched our little sister's arm, hard. I can't say I blamed her.</p>
<p>"What was that for?" Lindsay asked, rubbing her arm.</p>
<p>"Never mind," Lucy said. She turned and smiled at Kara. "Little sisters, right? So annoying."</p>
<p>"I have two older brothers," Kara said with a shrug, "They're weird, but mostly harmless."</p>
<p>"Are they both skiing with your parents?" I asked, desperate to change the subject. You know it was a bad sign if I was willing to bring that up again. It truly felt like the safer of the two conversations.</p>
<p>"Kevin is," Kara said, "But Kenny's over at his fiancee's house for the holiday."</p>
<p>"Oh cool," I said. Most. Awkward. Small talk. Ever.</p>
<p>"So, what's this thing you want to do, Lindsay?" Kara asked, "I'm intrigued."</p>
<p>"Oh, it's awesome," Lindsay said, "You'll love it."</p>
<p>"I think our little sister has had a little too much to drink," I said to Kara. Then I turned to my sister. "Right, Lindsay?"</p>
<p>"I'm fine," Lindsay said, calmly. "Let's go up to the bedroom like Dylan suggested."</p>
<p>Notice how I was now implicated in all this? Yeah, that was just lovely.</p>
<p>Lindsay cajoled us all into following her upstairs. She marched straight into my bedroom, grabbed one of my pillows, and followed it to the floor.</p>
<p>"Um, what are you...?" Kara stared from outside the door frame. We all did.</p>
<p>"It's simple, see," Lindsay said, "You rub yourself up against the pillow and it starts to feel really good.</p>
<p>"Oh wow," Kara said.</p>
<p>"Oh my," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Oh no," I said.</p>
<p>"And the three of you, um, do this together?" Kara asked.</p>
<p>My stomach rushed to the floor, broke through the foundation of the house, and headed right for the Earth's core. I wished to God I could follow it to my burning oblivion.</p>
<p>"Yup!" Lindsay said, casual as anything. "It's great on its own, but together makes it way more fun."</p>
<p>Kara was now staring straight at Lucy and me. I couldn't read the expression on her face. I desperately didn't want to. Whatever was behind those eyes, I didn't want to consider it. Just run and hide. Then die. Preferably quickly.</p>
<p>"She's not wrong," Lucy said, shrugging slightly, "It is fun. Right Dylan?"</p>
<p>Fuck me. "Uh, yeah," I said, "I mean, I guess. If you're into that kinda thing."</p>
<p>"And you are into it?" Kara asked.</p>
<p>Thus, there I was, trapped between not looking like a masturbating, incest pervert in front of a girl I liked or taking my sisters' side. And, in this case, I didn't truly have a choice now did I?</p>
<p>"Yup," I replied, "I guess I am."</p>
<p>Kara pursed her lips while tilting her head. "OK," she said, "Well, I suppose I should give it a try."</p>
<p>And then, like it was no big deal, she skipped into my bedroom, grabbed another pillow, and dropped down next to Lindsay on my hardwood floor. My little sister gave Kara a grin and patted her arm, like a friendly welcome.</p>
<p>Based on their descriptions, you might think that Kara and Lindsay looked alike. After all, both were short, petite brunettes with small breasts and perky butts. The most obvious difference was the hair, Lindsay's was long and straight whereas Kara's was wavier and cut to her shoulders. Further, Lindsay, thanks to her endless exercise obsession, was limber, while Kara was merely petite. And while Lindsay had more of a girl's face, Kara's appearance was softer and womanly. They were both super attractive, for sure, but the differences between the two were stark as they both lay down on the floor.</p>
<p>Lucy glanced at me, then looked at the two women in my bedroom. Even my sister, who usually seemed so in control of these things, was flummoxed by how all this had come together.</p>
<p>"I guess I'll get a pillow from my room," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Sometimes he strokes it for us, instead," Lindsay told Kara, weirdly matter-of-fact. "It's really hot."</p>
<p>"I'll bet," Kara said. She had a very different, yet still completely unreadable, expression on her face.</p>
<p>"I love it when he shoots," Lindsay said, "That's the best part."</p>
<p>"We should probably stick to pressing for now," Lucy said, returning with a pillow under one arm. This was not getting any more normal. The only explanation was that I'd cracked my skull at some point during dinner and this fever dream represented the death throes of my logical mind.</p>
<p>Lucy joined the other girls on the floor. She gave me a head nod. Well, seeing as I was already underwater, I supposed I might as well drown. Not needing a pillow for my own process, I simply lay down on the floor, facing my two sisters and my crush. The three of them looked so hot, splayed out in front of me.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>I remained in denial, though, because I was sure we were all going to lay there. I mean, this was well and good, but we weren't going to all masturbate on the floor. That was crazy.</p>
<p>But, of course, that's exactly what we did.</p>
<p>Lindsay started first, pressing her little butt down and gradually grinding herself back and forth on the pillow. Lucy followed, arching her back and pressing herself downward. Kara looked to her left and right, like taking notes. Then the pretty brunette girl, a woman I'd lusted after for years, did something sort of in-between what the two siblings were doing.</p>
<p>"Oh..." Kara said, "That's interesting."</p>
<p>"I know right?" Lindsay said, "Like you can kind of see how it would work but once you do it, the whole thing seems way more obvious."</p>
<p>"And pleasurable," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Yep," Kara said, "Definitely." Her dark brown eyes glassed over, and I could see she was already gone.</p>
<p>Watching this should have had me hard, but the nerves of everything kept me soft. Ironically, that was the perfect place for me to be in order to get my press on. I squeezed my glutes, letting the pressure build. Kept my muscles tight for as long as I could, then relaxed. Once I recovered, I started again.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I knew it was a bad idea to look at the girls in the room with me. On the other, I couldn't imagine doing this without watching Kara and my sisters get off. It was too good an opportunity to turn down.</p>
<p>"Ah. Sssssso good," Kara said. Her voice choked and strained. Fuck, that girl was gorgeous. I'd fantasized about her for almost as long as she'd been friends with Lucy. Seeing her there, edging to her orgasm, was nothing short of incredible.</p>
<p>"Yuh-yeah," Lindsay agreed. My cute little sister looked so adorable getting herself off. That illicit mix of innocent and alluring only made it all the more amazing.</p>
<p>"Getting... close," Lucy said. I'd seen this with my sexy older sister so often, yet it never failed to be fantastic.</p>
<p>There was no chance I would last long. Fortunately, my companions still managed to beat me to the punch. They fell in order, like dominoes. Lucy was the first to go, eyes rolling back in her head with a long, low groan. Lindsay toppled next, letting out her usual little high-pitched squeak. Finally, Kara shuddered, froze and released a stuttering, choking gasp.</p>
<p>"Ah-ah-AH!" She fell forward, burying her head in her arms.</p>
<p>I'd just seen my crush girl orgasm for the first time. It didn't matter that I was in a room, masturbating, with my sisters. I didn't care that Kara's cum had been self-supplied. It was glorious. I couldn't have gotten a greater wish from a genie.</p>
<p>I spurted before I even realized I was there. It hit me so fast, so hard, I moaned out loud. The heat of my seed spurting into my underwear. When I looked up, my vision out of focus, I saw Kara staring right at me. Our eyes locked. Finally, the pleasure overcame me, and I let my head drop.</p>
<p>We all lay there like the dead for a moment. It felt like someone should say something. It seemed like silence was the best policy.</p>
<p>Kara got up first, breaking the spell. "Well, that was, um, interesting," she said. She brushed her hands on her jeans.</p>
<p>"I'll see you out," Lucy said, weakly. She stood up on trembling legs.</p>
<p>"No need," Kara said. She quickly headed out of the room and down the steps.</p>
<p>My sisters and I shared a knowing look. Incredibly, we'd all managed to fuck things up even worse than they already were.</p>
<p>I spent the night running disaster scenarios through my head. In the best case, Kara simply kept quiet and never spoke to any of us again. In the worst... there were too many 'worsts' for me to track.</p>
<p>When I got up the next morning, I found Lucy sitting at the table. My blonde sister looked like she'd had about as much sleep as me.</p>
<p>"This is bad, right?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Really bad," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Fucking Lindsay."</p>
<p>"We could have stopped her," Lucy said, "This is on all of us."</p>
<p>"Kara's your friend," I said, "Maybe you should talk to her?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm pretty sure she and I will be talking plenty soon enough," Lucy said. The tone of her voice made it clear that it was not going to be a jolly conversation.</p>
<p>Lindsay came down a few moments later. She had on a tank top and yoga pants. Her eyes were sunken, but she acted surprisingly upbeat as she made herself a morning cup of herbal tea.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about last night, guys," she said. "I really thought Kara would enjoy it." You'd have thought she was talking about watching a horror movie or trying an exotic cuisine. Not rubbing off together in front of a friend.</p>
<p>"Lindsay this has to stop," Lucy said, "It was fun, but we can't do this. We're already risking too much."</p>
<p>"But..." I could tell Lindsay was about to do the whole chakra speech, but common sense finally came in and stopped her.</p>
<p>"I know. I'm the one that started it," Lucy said, "But it was a mistake. This isn't going to end well for any of us."</p>
<p>Lindsay hung her head. She slowly nodded. I could tell she was disappointed -- hell, so was I -- but there was no arguing this. We'd done something dumb, and the only recourse was, once again, to stop putting ourselves in the position.</p>
<p>Lucy's phone beeped and she looked down at it.</p>
<p>"It's Kara," she said, sullenly. "She wants to come over and talk."</p>
<p>The Friday after Thanksgiving is usually an off day, but Dad and Jan were both able to get extra pay by going into the office. Mom decided to brave the crowds at the mall to see if she could take advantage of the sales. That left myself, Lucy, and Lindsay alone in the house, once again. At least that meant Kara couldn't get us into too much trouble. Or maybe I was delusional again.</p>
<p>I tried to think about what I would do in her situation. Freak out? For sure. Call the cops? Jeez, I hoped not. I assumed that Kara would want to back away quietly. So why was she coming back to the house? I could only think of two possibilities. She was going to scream bloody murder at us for dragging her into it. Or she was going to threaten to tell someone -- parents, police, local press -- and blackmail us. Both possibilities felt equally possible and completely disastrous.</p>
<p>"Maybe it'll be OK," Lucy said, the two of us sitting nervously on the couch. She had on a pink, fuzzy sweater and dark blue jeans. We shared a dubious look. "I mean, she got off, too. Right?"</p>
<p>There was a loud knock on the door. Lucy stood up to answer it like walking to the lethal injection. A slow, reluctant stride. Lindsay gave me a nervous look. I shrugged back at her.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Lucy said as she opened the door. Her happiness so forced it hurt me.</p>
<p>"Hi," Kara said. I noticed she wouldn't meet my sister's eyes. Instead, she tucked her hair behind her ear and walked into the house.</p>
<p>All of us stared at Kara as she made her way to the couch and sat down. Like looking at a tiger who'd randomly rambled into our living room. Lucy and Lindsay joined us, and now all four of us sat there. The silence was deafening.</p>
<p>"Do you want anything to drink?" Lucy asked.</p>
<p>"No, I'm still feeling last night," Kara said.</p>
<p>OK, last night came up and she didn't say anything about it. Maybe this was a good sign. Perhaps she was going to pretend that nothing happened. Oh, who was I kidding? This was a nightmare, and it was only getting darker from here.</p>
<p>"So," Kara said, letting the word hang in the air like an axe above our necks. "Do you want to maybe do the thing? You know from last night?"</p>
<p>And somehow the room got silent-er. I didn't think that was possible. Like muting a show that was already quiet. If we could have heard a pin drop before, now it felt like we could hear the molecules of the pin vibrating.</p>
<p>Did Kara just...? I couldn't even think the words.</p>
<p>"Seriously?" Lindsay asked. She couldn't hide the thrum of excitement from her voice. "That would be awesome."</p>
<p>Kara nodded. Her face slightly flushed. I realized that she wasn't anxious with anger or upset with disgust. The pretty brunette was straight up horny. I think all of us were too relieved to question why.</p>
<p>"I'll get us girls some pillows," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"OK to do it here?" Lindsay asked.</p>
<p>"Sure thing," Kara said. Then she looked right at me. "But I want to see Dylan shoot this time."</p>
<p>Our first go went so quickly, it was over before I could take stock of it. The women all writhed on the floor, then stared up at me, rapturous, as I inseminated the Kleenex. It was fast and fun, but I was barely recovered from the scare of that morning so I couldn't fully enjoy it.</p>
<p>"Your brother's got a nice one," Kara said, as if I wasn't in the room to hear.</p>
<p>"I know, right?" Lindsay said, "I love watching him cum."</p>
<p>"Feels even better when he spurts it on you," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Well, fuck, I have to try that," Kara said.</p>
<p>We took a break for lunch (we're not depraved), then headed up to my bedroom. This time, I managed to convince the girls that they needed to be topless if they wanted to see my spend and they happily obliged.</p>
<p>Kara's tits were larger than Lindsay's and quite nice, with light brown, puffy nipples. They had a slight upward curve to them as well. Should I admit that, despite the wonder of seeing my crush's bare chest, I preferred my sister's titties? Welp, I guess it's too late now.</p>
<p>So now there were three hot, topless girls getting themselves off on my floor while I stroked myself next to them.</p>
<p>"Do you think about him, your brother, while you do this?" Kara asked Lucy, both of them red-faced and sweating.</p>
<p>"...Sometimes," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Fuck that's hot," Kara said.</p>
<p>"What about you?" Lucy asked Kara. "Do you think about it?"</p>
<p>"You mean Dylan?" Kara asked, "Or my own brothers?"</p>
<p>"Both."</p>
<p>"...Sometimes."</p>
<p>Kara's admission seemed to set Lindsay off because she came a moment later. Her usual high-pitched squeal was more of a scream. Lucy and Kara both shuddered after her. Then all three women looked up at me, expectantly.</p>
<p>They didn't have long to wait. A moment later, the pleasure raced up my dick and splattered the three of them. I got them on their backs again, mostly. But I was pleased to see a few drops dripping down Kara's chest.</p>
<p>All three of us lay back, panting. For some reason, I felt the awkwardness slide over us again. What were we doing? How was this actually happening? I knew that reality would break in at any moment, the spell would crack, and we'd all be left with nothing but disappointment and shame.</p>
<p>"You're right, Lus," Kara said, "It is better when he cums on you."</p>
<p>The third time(!?) was even better(?!?!?!?!). Rather than join the girls in pressing, Kara decided to sit on the other side of me and get herself off with her fingers. We made a little masturbation sandwich that way, me stroking my cock, my sisters lying on the ground, and Kara on the other side. Her legs spread wide, hiding nothing.</p>
<p>She already had her top off and for this round, Kara stripped down naked. I was surprised to see that her pussy was covered in dark, curly hair -- completely untrimmed. There was something arousing and naughty about that.</p>
<p>I guess the situation, the exposure, got to the pretty brunette because she orgasmed almost immediately.</p>
<p>"That was. A good one," she gasped out. Then she kept going.</p>
<p>I sat back and lazily stroked my cock while the three girls got themselves off. Despite already exploding twice that day, I could tell I was on a hair trigger. Seeing Kara's bare pussy put me at another level.</p>
<p>"God, that cock looks good," Kara said, staring right at me. I couldn't stop the smile that ran across my face. For a moment, I thought that maybe it meant she was going to do more. I was wrong. But only sort of.</p>
<p>"I know right?" Lindsay said, "I love watching him while I get off."</p>
<p>"You should stroke it for him," Kara said, "Feel it."</p>
<p>"You mean," Lindsay said between gasps. "Get him off?"</p>
<p>"Don't you want to?" Kara asked, "Have your brother's hot, hard cock in your hands? Feel it thicken and tremor when it shoots. Know it was you that made that happen?"</p>
<p>Lindsay stopped rubbing and looked down at the ground, shyly. I thought for sure that Kara had taken things too far.</p>
<p>My little sister leapt to her feet and practically tackled me. Her little tits swung as she rumbled over. We both groaned as she grabbed hold of my dick.</p>
<p>Lindsay's strokes were far too fast and clumsy but it hardly mattered. Her enthusiasm more than made up for it. I saw she was also working herself with her free hand. For a moment, I thought about reaching over but I was too in her control to move.</p>
<p>"That's a good little sister," Kara said, "Making your brother cum."</p>
<p>As you can imagine, I didn't make it much further after that. Lindsay giggled as my cock swelled in her palm. She made sure my first burst hit her chest, then aimed the next down at Lucy. As soon as my seed spattered her back, my older sister was swallowed by an orgasm of her own.</p>
<p>I lost track of things for a moment, the ecstasy overwhelming my senses. I was vaguely aware of the groans of pleasure as the girls also got off. Happy moans and blissful giggles. I waited for consciousness to drift back, but instead I just felt warm and sleepy. Finally sated, the four of us passed out on the floor.</p>
<p>We woke up before anyone came home, thank God. I can only imagine the reaction if someone saw us. Mostly naked, covered in boy and girl cum, splayed out practically on top of each other. We looked like we'd had an orgy and, honestly, we kind of had.</p>
<p>All of us slowly dressed, then limped down to the kitchen. Whatever was left of our awkwardness had been wiped away by three, hardcore, stroke sessions.</p>
<p>"You want to come by again tomorrow?" Lindsay asked as Kara gathered her things.</p>
<p>"I'm heading back to school, sadly," Kara said, "I'll be back for Christmas, though."</p>
<p>"Cool," Lucy said. Her casual acknowledgement that we would be continuing through the winter holidays was almost as arousing as what we'd all done together. A promise of our future promiscuity</p>
<p>The best friends hugged goodbye. then Lindsay and Kara shared an awkward little wave.</p>
<p>"This was fun," Kara said, "I might have to start up something similar back at school."</p>
<p>"Not at home?" Lindsay asked, teasing.</p>
<p>"Yeah, maybe that too." She was so quiet, I couldn't be sure she actually said it.</p>
<p>Then Kara shut the door behind her. As it clicked closed, I realized that she'd never said goodbye to me. For a moment, I felt sad. Kara was my crush girl and after everything that had happened...</p>
<p>I looked over at my two sisters. They were smiling at me, desirous. Maybe I was better off without Kara, after all.</p>
<p>The next day was Saturday. Jan was out doing Jan-things on a weekend trip with friends, but my parents were both home all day, making it hard for us to get away with anything. It was probably for the best; I think we all needed a day to recover after Thanksgiving's debauchery.</p>
<p>But there was a further finality to everything. Kara, our newest and most surprising co-conspirator, was already gone. Our own break was almost over. And while I was convinced that Lucy, Kara and I would continue on, I knew that things were going to change. So, I went into Sunday pretty confident that any sibling sexy-time was going to be on pause for a while.</p>
<p>Repeat it with me now: I was wrong.</p>
<p>Sunday morning, I should have seen the signs. First thing, before the rest of the family woke up, Lindsay caught me making breakfast. She touched my chest, then let her hand slink down lower. Her fingers dandled near my groin.</p>
<p>Despite everything we'd already done, I nearly jumped out of my skin. Yes, in the heat of everything on Friday, my little sister had stroked me off. But in the cold morning light, right in the middle of the kitchen, it still felt weird. And dangerous.</p>
<p>"We need to do stuff again," she said, grinning at me broadly, "Soon."</p>
<p>I knew better than to argue it with her at this point. So instead of protesting, I tried to play it off with a joke.</p>
<p>"You want to give our chakras a little recharge?" I asked.</p>
<p>Lindsay's hand slid lower. "Actually, I was hoping we could align them," she whispered in my ear. She grabbed my cock through my pants. I was hard as hell, of course I was, and she gave me a steady squeeze.</p>
<p>I didn't need a yogi to tell me what my little sister was implying. Hell, Yogi Bear could have solved that riddle. The hornier part of my mind (aka the majority) leapt for joy. But the smaller, smarter part, held back. I'd been there once before, with Lucy, and that had gone about as badly as possible.</p>
<p>I jumped away, separating myself from my little sister.</p>
<p>"I don't think that's a good idea," I said.</p>
<p>"You always say that," Lindsay said, pouting, "But then I always prove you wrong."</p>
<p>"No, it's not like that," I said, "Lucy and I, we..." I froze. Was I revealing a confidence to my sister? Something I wasn't supposed to share?</p>
<p>"What happened with you two?" Lindsay asked, "It seems like you both are into things, even more than me. But you keep yourselves controlled."</p>
<p>"We made a mistake," I said, "I don't think I should say anything more."</p>
<p>"It'll be different," Lindsay said, "I don't get jealous. And I don't care about physical stuff. It's just our bodies. It's natural."</p>
<p>"Are you on birth control?" I asked. I know, I said the think-y part out loud. But at that point, I knew I needed to act the older brother.</p>
<p>Lindsay tilted her head at me, confused. "You know I'm not," she said, "We had to stop all the prescriptions. But I trust you. I know we'll be safe."</p>
<p>I gave her a dubious look.</p>
<p>"Seriously? What happened?" Lindsay asked. Her usually sunny disposure had gone grey.</p>
<p>"Nothing," I said, "Ask Lucy."</p>
<p>"I'm asking you," Lindsay said. She pressed against me, and not in the fun way.</p>
<p>"Oh! I hope that's fresh coffee I smell!" Mom called down from the stairs. A moment later, she flounced into the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Pot's ready now," I said.</p>
<p>"I knew we had you kids for a reason," Mom said. She reached for a mug and filled it.</p>
<p>When I looked over to find Lindsay again, I saw she'd already left the room.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the morning out doing chores. OK, fine, I spent it hiding from my sister. Still, it was the thought that counted.</p>
<p>When I came back home, it seemed that the house had emptied. Thinking I was safe, I plopped down on the couch and turned on the TV. Not a second later, my other masturbating sister was sitting right next to me.</p>
<p>Lucy gave me a quick, pained grimace as she plopped down on the couch. She was in her now-usual-for-the season sweater and jeans -- a black top this time that looked good with her golden hair.</p>
<p>"Lindsay talked to me," she said.</p>
<p>"Oh," I said.</p>
<p>"She seems to think something happened between you and me," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"We're fine," I said. I gave her an almost believable smile. "More than fine."</p>
<p>"Maybe I shouldn't have included her," Lucy said, "At the time, it seemed like a good idea."</p>
<p>"A lot of bad ideas seem smart when we're in the middle of that kind of stuff," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes," Lucy said, she chewed at her lower lip. "I never blamed you. For what happened."</p>
<p>"You could have," I said, "Probably should have."</p>
<p>"No, that's not right," Lucy said, "What we did, we did it together. I'm not sad that it happened, either. I mean, not the end part. That was..."</p>
<p>"A mistake," I interrupted.</p>
<p>"Hell yeah," Lucy said, "Big-o mistake-o."</p>
<p>"Humung-o."</p>
<p>"But the rest of it," Lucy said, "The only thing I regret is that we did something that made it stop. Lindsay's crazy but she's right about one thing: there's nothing wrong with what we're doing. It's fine. It's fun."</p>
<p>"Unless we get caught," I said.</p>
<p>"We won't," Lucy said, "We'll be careful."</p>
<p>I think I wanted to believe her so much, I let her convince me. It was becoming a bad habit on my part.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"There's stuff we shouldn't do," I said.</p>
<p>"Agreed," Lucy said, "But as long as we keep things within the boundaries...?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "I'm good with that."</p>
<p>As if I could have possibly answered any other way.</p>
<p>With work coming the next day, my parents called it an early night. Jan, apparently, was planning to go straight from her weekend thing to work the next day, so we were on our own. Lindsay, Lucy and I sat on the couch and watched TV, innocent as ever.</p>
<p>But once the lights were out, and the house was quiet, we turned off the television and slinked upstairs. We didn't say a word. We didn't need to. Lucy opened her bedroom door and we stepped inside, like soldiers ready to do our duty.</p>
<p>As if they'd agreed on it before, both of my sisters stripped off their tops as soon as the door was shut. Lucy's massive melons burst forth, as full and fantastic as ever. Lindsay's little lemons jiggled joyously as they were freed from her lacy bra.</p>
<p>I knew my cues, so I stepped out of my pants and underwear. My dick, already impossibly erect, pointed outward. Like it was trying to select a sister.</p>
<p>Lucy reached for a pillow to put it on the floor, but my little sister grabbed for something far different. Her thin fingers wrapped around my dick. I was too surprised to shout.</p>
<p>Lindsay saw the way Lucy was looking at her and shrugged. As if to ask, what's the big deal?</p>
<p>Lucy thought about it for a second, then moved her shoulders the same way her little sister had. Lindsay had already stroked me off once (and Lucy had done far, far more) so I guess there wasn't much to argue.</p>
<p>I sat down on the floor. Lindsay sat next to me, never letting go of my dick.</p>
<p>"I can't wait to try this out," she said, with an almost contagious enthusiasm.</p>
<p>I thought to point out that she'd already had a go once before, but decided that the time for arguing details was not when my sister was getting ready to jerk me off. So, instead, I smiled at her and offered to return the favor.</p>
<p>Lindsay looked down at herself, realizing that meant stripping down completely. To my surprise, she actually seemed shy.</p>
<p>"That's OK," she said, "Another time."</p>
<p>"Well, if that's being offered count me in," Lucy said.</p>
<p>I couldn't hide my grin as my curvy sister stepped out of her pants and sat next to me, completely naked. She spread her legs, then took my hand and put it right between them. Her muff was warm and already quite wet.</p>
<p>"Fuck, that's hot," Lindsay said. She kept her hand on my dick, but she wasn't moving it. Instead, she stared, agape, while I slowly began fingering our older sister.</p>
<p>"Um, Linds," I said.</p>
<p>"Get to work, little sis," Lucy said, far more pointedly.</p>
<p>Lindsay grinned. She squeezed my cock even tighter, then slowly started to stroke.</p>
<p>"Like this?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I little less tight," I said.</p>
<p>"OK, awesome," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>She began rubbing my cock up and down. The way she did it, like it was the most exciting privilege in the world, made up for any technical shortcomings.</p>
<p>I hoped my own excitement would be enough for Lucy, too. We'd gotten so into dry humping before, that we'd never bothered with manual stimulation. Still, I had a pretty good idea of what I was doing -- I knew how to hit the high notes, as it were -- and so I focused on that. Slotted a finger in Lucy's sex while I used my thumb on her clit.</p>
<p>Lucy groaned. I gasped. Lindsay giggled.</p>
<p>The three of us formed a building, bonding chain. Lindsay stuck her free hand into her jeans and started to stimulate herself, completing the circuit. Now each of us was moving closer to our ecstatic ends.</p>
<p>I noticed, almost laughing, that we'd aligned ourselves into a strange sibling order. The younger stimulating the older. I was fingering my big sister, while Lindsay worked her big brother. For a moment, I wondered if that meant that Lucy should also be pleasing Jan, but I pushed that thought out of my head. Our serious older sister was not going to be joining these sessions. She was a potential impediment, not an eager participant.</p>
<p>And then, just when I thought things couldn't get any hotter, my sisters started talking.</p>
<p>"That's it, Linds," Lucy said, "Stroke that big brother dick."</p>
<p>"His fingers feel good in your pussy?" Lindsay asked.</p>
<p>"Fuck yeah," Lucy said, "You should have let him work you over."</p>
<p>"Next time it'll be my turn," Lindsay said, "And you can get him off. You want that? Feel Dylan's cock spurting in your hands?"</p>
<p>"In my mouth," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Lindsay said. She eyed my dick like she was thinking about it.</p>
<p>"Be a good girl and suck his dick," Lucy told her. Much more commanding. "Show him how much you need his cum."</p>
<p>"I want to," Lindsay said, "Want it. Inside me."</p>
<p>"Yeah, swallow it all up," Lucy said, missing the implication of Lindsay's words. "Take his load like a good little sister."</p>
<p>For a moment, I could see where Lindsay's brain was headed. I saw her fingers start to unsnap her jeans, and I knew she was about to tumble over the precipice. The one place we definitely could not go.</p>
<p>So, I took my other hand, the one not buried in my big sister's pussy, and lightly pushed down on the back of Lindsay's head. Yes, I know, it's hard to argue I was being heroic by forcing my sister to suck me off. But I still say it was the better option.</p>
<p>Lindsay obediently let me lower her. She opened her mouth and gulped my cock in one, wet stroke.</p>
<p>"Fuck, that feels good, Linds," I said, unable to control the words coming out of my mouth.</p>
<p>Lindsay's long brown hair hung cool around my legs. Her innocent face contorted into a perfect cocksucking expression. She made happy little sucking sounds as she tasted, tested, at my dick.</p>
<p>Lucy groaned in frustration as my fingering slowed, but what did she expect was going to happen? Fortunately, the combination of all the stimulation so far meant I wasn't going to last on Lindsay's tongue.</p>
<p>She slurped sloppily up and down my dick, and that was all it took.</p>
<p>"Oh God!" I cried out, the only warning I could give.</p>
<p>"MMmmmmm!" Lindsay groaned as my cock thickened, then jolted out my first burst of cum.</p>
<p>Lindsay took my first shot and coughed. She fell back. My next blast hit my cute sister right in the face. A big glob of white across her forehead and cheek. Dripping off her nose.</p>
<p>I was so lost in my orgasm by then, I lost track of everything else. My sense of the world around me dimmed. It felt so good, firing off. You'd think I hadn't cum for months, rather than a day and a half.</p>
<p>Distantly, I was aware of something warm engulfing my cock, again. Somehow, I knew it wasn't Lindsay. I forced myself to focus on saw Lucy, now bent over, suckling at my slowly shrinking cock.</p>
<p>"Yeah, sis, clean him up," Lindsay said, "Be a good girl for your baby brother."</p>
<p>Lucy didn't rise to the tease but kept running her tongue over me. It was too sensitive to feel good, exactly, but I wasn't going to stop my sister either.</p>
<p>I flopped back against the wall. Post-cum satisfaction washed over me. This was, without a doubt, perfect. Both my sisters sucking me off. Me getting to play with their warm, wet pussies. I was in heaven. And I could tell that things were only going to get better from there.</p>
<p>I looked up at Lucy's door and saw it was open. Standing there in the opening, mouth agape, was our older sister, Jan. She stared at the scene before her with a disgust strong enough to melt stone.</p>
<p>Next Time: things escalate even further than I could have imagined.</p>


<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>Last time, Dylan and his older sister Lucy started masturbating together. Then their younger sister Lindsay and Lucy's best friend, Kara, joined in. But now that they've finally been caught, what will come of their conspiracy?</p>
<p>All participants are over the age of 18</p>
<p>"I know what you've been doing," Jan said, glaring at me.</p>
<p>We were standing in the hallway by the bedrooms. My oldest sister stood with her hands on her hips. Nearly as tall as me, Jan's inky black hair was tied in its usual tight bun. She had her head tilted to the side -- a glare etched into her sky-blue eyes.</p>
<p>It was late November, the Sunday after Thanksgiving. For the past four months, I'd been engaging in a spectacular celebration of self-love with my sisters. A few moments before, in fact, the three of us had concluded an epic session where we'd ended up rubbing each other off in a wild daisy chain of mutual masturbation. Like an overcharged orgasmic circuit.</p>
<p>It had all begun in the summer, when my busty, blonde, older sister, Lucy invited me to join her in humping the floor. Then, as the weather got colder, my thin, brunette, younger sister, Lindsay and I had started stroking ourselves together. The only sibling who hadn't been involved in our incestuous fapping festival was Jan.</p>
<p>Except, now she was. And in the worst way possible.</p>
<p>Back in the hallway with Jan -- my oldest sister glaring at me with undisguised disgust -- I stared down at the floor, doing my best to look sheepish. I knew there was no point in arguing it. I'd been caught (quite literally) red handed.</p>
<p>There was no argument for what we were doing, either. No explanation that made any sense. What we'd been up to was beyond perverse. It was really, truly wrong. Of course, that was also the attraction of it. But I wasn't going to tell my oldest sister that.</p>
<p>Instead, I stood there, avoiding Jan's gaze, and hoping to hell she would go easy on me.</p>
<p>"I know what you've been doing," Jan said, a smirk edging across her thin lips. "And I want in."</p>
<p>Jan had always been distant from the rest of us. Like she was one of the adults rather than a kid. She had a kind of aloof maturity -- even when we were all very much not mature -- that set her apart. The age thing played into that. Whereas we were kind of clumped together (Lucy was 21 to my 19 to Lindsay's 18), Jan felt oddly older at 23. It was more than that, however.</p>
<p>Even in high school, Jan dressed prim and proper. We didn't attend a private school, but Jan always had a uniform: dark skirt and hose, white dress shirt, her hair tied up so tight it strained at the roots.</p>
<p>When Jan left for college, I honestly thought that was the last we'd see of her. She came back for holidays, but even then, she was more of a shadow than a sibling. After Jan graduated school, she really did almost disappear. She had a promising career, a lovely apartment in the city, and a fiance for whom the best description was 'appropriate.'</p>
<p>But when things went in the crapper -- when Dad lost his job and we had to give up our house and our lives in payment for his mistakes -- Jan moved back in with us to help out. Coincidentally or not, Jan's engagement broke apart at around the same time. While Lucy, Lindsay, and I attended school, Jan went to work. She wasn't Mom or Dad, and she didn't play at being them. Jan seemed more like a cool aunt or a hip neighbor or something like that.</p>
<p>My oldest sister was an oddly distant mystery. A foggy mirage, staring at us from some other remote place, even when she was sitting at the same table and eating the same meal.</p>
<p>Which only made my sister's reaction that afternoon all the more alarming. I don't think Jan intended it as a threat. Especially in retrospect, I know that she wasn't trying to menace me. It's just how it felt, in that moment, when she held me under the knife.</p>
<p>The next day was a Monday, and we all returned to our routines. Mom, Dad, and Jan all left before the rest of us were awake. Once again, Lucy dropped Lindsay off at the high school, then drove the two of us to our own classes at the community college.</p>
<p>The whole drive, the car was oddly silent. We didn't mention how we'd busted through all kinds of barriers the day before. How Lindsay had sucked my dick. How I'd fingered Lucy to a spectacular finish. How we'd egged each other on the entire time. What we'd done had been beyond anything we'd shared before. And what was worse (better?) it had only felt like a warmup for something way more intimate.</p>
<p>We'd been so easy with each other the day before. It made the discomfort of our morning commute seem even more oppressive. To be fair, not talking was normal for Lucy and me. Our shared sessions had always been a strange, unspoken agreement.</p>
<p>But the silence was downright odd for Lindsay who often liked to go through things blow-by-blow (pun definitely intended) like a hot John Madden, reliving every moment in detail before announcing her plans for more mischief later in the day.</p>
<p>I honestly didn't know what was going on. And I couldn't ascribe the awkwardness to Jan because I hadn't told my other sisters what had happened. Partially because our oldest sibling had asked me not to. Also, though, because it felt like it was my issue to deal with. I didn't want to drag my other siblings down into the morass we'd made.</p>
<p>After we dropped Lindsay off, I came out and asked Lucy about it. The awkwardness, I mean.</p>
<p>"I think we're all settling back in," Lucy said, "With school and stuff. We always tend to be a bit more laid back around the breaks, right?"</p>
<p>"I guess so," I said, "I just hope I didn't do anything wrong."</p>
<p>"Oh no," Lucy said, a lascivious little smile playing on her lips. "In fact, I'd say you did everything right."</p>
<p>I let out a large sigh of relief. I wanted to believe my older sister was correct. I really did.</p>
<p>"Look, we've got three more weeks of school," Lucy continued, "But after that we have a whole eleven days off. I counted. We need to keep our heads down for a little longer. Then we can celebrate for real."</p>
<p>After classes, we came home. Any concerns I might have had following our morning commute were quickly put to rest when Lucy, Lindsay and I did the most normal thing possible: we went for a quick press in the living room before heading off to do homework. It was both weird and reassuring that such a lewd act was the thing to settle my nerves rather than stretch them out.</p>
<p>But there was still the problem of what my oldest sister wanted. I know, it probably seems obvious (in retrospect it was fucking obvious) but at the time I truly didn't know what to make of it.</p>
<p>I want in. What did Jan mean by that? Was she going to join Lucy, Lindsay and I and rub herself off on a pillow? I couldn't picture it.</p>
<p>I mean, if I thought about it (and to be fair, it wasn't the kind of thing I'd ever thought about till that moment), I wasn't even sure Jan masturbated at all. Not that I was keeping track of such things. It was just that my older sister didn't seem the type. Oh sure, she had several serious boyfriends -- one in high school, two in college, then Mr. Milquetoast-the-fiance-that-was-no-longer -- and so I imagined she'd done lots of stuff.</p>
<p>But thinking about my oldest sister abandoning herself to illicit pleasure? This was the girl who'd once celebrated going on a thrilling water slide by saying 'hm' and heading back to her chair to read a book. Jan wasn't exactly a slave to her baser desires. I wasn't sure she even had baser desires. So as 'duh' as I'm sure her comment seems to you all, the idea that my sister was going to rub one out with all of us seemed pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p>But, if not that, what could Jan's words mean?</p>
<p>It's hard to explain how fraught and broken this all felt. The exultation of what I'd shared with Lucy and Lindsay the day before mixed with the curiosity and concern of what Jan had said soon after. Like honey mixed with ghost peppers, burning as it slid so sweetly into my stomach.</p>
<p>I was left to ponder it for hours. That night, we had dinner as a family (Lucy and I on the couch with stack tables). I caught Jan's eye at one point, and she arched an eyebrow. But nothing more. We washed up after, then broke to our separate rooms.</p>
<p>I sat at my desk and opened books to study. Midterms were only a few short weeks away, as Lucy had reminded me, and I needed to get to work.</p>
<p>The day was already quite dark. The house grew quieter, except for the little creaks that this old place always let out. Like the specters had to settle in, as well. At a certain point, I realized that whatever Jan had meant, I wasn't going to find out that night. Or maybe ever. It all seemed so impossible.</p>
<p>Right as I was about to give up and go to sleep, I heard my cell phone buzz. I picked it up and looked at the screen. One word from Jan.</p>
<p>"Come"</p>
<p>Slipping into Jan's bedroom felt odd. My oldest sister's forbidding nature made her personal space seem all the more foreboding. Even back in the old house, after Jan had left for college, I was uncomfortable going anywhere near her stuff. Like she'd left a curse on it all or something.</p>
<p>I closed the door behind me carefully, my breath sharp and thin in my chest. Jan's bedroom was as dark as the rest of the house, but I could still make out her spare, utilitarian furniture and oddly bare walls. And, most importantly, I saw my oldest sister, lying back on her bed in a plain white t-shirt and pink, plaid pj pants. She had a book on her lap, like she was up to nothing outside of normal.</p>
<p>Jan saw me enter and a wicked grin filled her face. She raised her eyebrow in that usual inquisitive way, then sat up. Jan was tall, nearly my height, like Lucy. But she was willow thin like Lindsay. Each of us a slight variation on the other in a way that made us look quite unique yet all from the same source. Weirdly familiar and oddly distinct. Siblings, in other words.</p>
<p>Jan patted the bedside next to her and I sat down. For a moment, we both just sat there. I swear I felt the air around me tighten. Even breathing was an epic undertaking.</p>
<p>"Well," Jan said.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Well?" Jan asked.</p>
<p>For a moment, I was taken aback. This whole time, I'd been assuming that my oldest sister would drive. That she was taking the lead because she was the one who'd demanded it, right? And wasn't Jan always in charge anyways?</p>
<p>But I realized that wasn't true. I'd been the one who'd begun all this (well, technically, Lucy had started it but that was nitpicking). If there was an expert in shared sibling stroke sessions, that person was me. Jan asking in wasn't a threat, it was a request. And now that she'd RSVP'd, it was only natural for her to assume that I'd be starting the party.</p>
<p>I cleared my throat, apologetically. "Usually we'd..." I gestured to the floor.</p>
<p>"Don't be ridiculous," Jan said. There was the oldest sister I knew and loved/feared.</p>
<p>"OK, well, um. I mean. I'm not sure how you like to, you know. Go." I know, great public speaker me. I could run for governor with that kind of eloquence and clarity.</p>
<p>Jan sighed, a sound that let me know she was both disappointed in my performance but also not at all surprised that I'd flubbed it in the first place. She reached over to her nightstand, lifted up a bunch of papers, and retrieved a purple dildo. I'd have been less surprised if she'd pulled an elephant out of there.</p>
<p>The fact that Jan had a toy at all was already a huge shock. The fact that it was so outrageous and lewd, clearly not a beginner item, nearly blew my brain right out the back of my head. I mean, this was a dildo.</p>
<p>It was bright, Barney-purple, and so long it would shame a porn star. And thick. And covered in ridges and bumps. And curved in ways that I couldn't imagine would feel good. And... It looked like a farce's idea of a sex toy -- so over the top that I started to wonder if my oldest sister was messing with me.</p>
<p>Wordlessly, Jan got off the bed. She took her desk chair and wheeled it over to the side, so she was facing me. Then, like it was nothing at all, she shucked off her bottoms, revealing a trim, tidy pussy with a stripe of dark pubic hair. Jan sat down and spread her legs. She held the dildo precipitously over her pussy. The purple, plastic cock of Damocles waiting to plunge.</p>
<p>Jan cleared her throat again. It was not a pleasant noise. I pulled down my sweats and boxers. While my big head had been off in the clouds, my littler one had clearly been thinking of something different (Sisterpussy! I could practically hear it screaming). My dick popped out epically hard and already pulsing.</p>
<p>I sat back on the bed, my cock pointing upward like there was something super interesting on the ceiling that it needed me to see. I don't know what I expected from my sister after my big reveal. But I definitely didn't anticipate the way the usually aloof woman licked her lips, smiled, and said, "Nice."</p>
<p>Jan flipped a switch and her already absurd phallus jumped another level as it started to buzz and shake. The toy practically undulated in her hands. A moment later, she let out a little gasp as it made contact with her clit.</p>
<p>I might have been off in space -- completely stretched between shock and arousal -- but I knew my cue. I grabbed my cock and started to slowly stroke it. I felt myself already on edge and I wanted to make sure I got to watch Jan go first.</p>
<p>In that moment, I realized how apex sexy my oldest sister was. Jan didn't have Lucy's killer curves or Lindsay's libidinous personality. But Jan's body -- those long shapely legs, the hint of her taut bubble butt, that tight little twat. My oldest sister was an absolute smoke show, and I was already regretting not telling her to take her top off.</p>
<p>The fact that Jan was usually so serious, so reserved, only made this moment where she surrendered to her own sexuality feel even more exciting and raw. Seeing her private self -- the way her lip curled and her eyes unfocused; how her knees raised and spread almost subconsciously. Jan was like a living aphrodisiac reclining in a desk chair.</p>
<p>God DAMN I'd underappreciated the opportunity I had before me. Then, as if it wasn't already too much, Jan started talking.</p>
<p>"Such a naughty little brother. Stroking that big cock in front of your sister."</p>
<p>I'd have done a spit take if I'd been drinking. Jan's words were so fucking hot, my dick almost did its own kind of spit take right there.</p>
<p>Jan's voice went low and raspy. It practically thrummed with need. She could have told me to jab a pencil in my eye with that tone and I'd have agreed without hesitation. Fortunately, she only wanted one thing.</p>
<p>"You're not supposed to do that -- oh! -- little bro," Jan said.</p>
<p>She continued to tease at herself with her toy. The dildo no longer seemed silly at all. No, that lavender monstrosity was now deadly serious. And all I could think about was how badly I wished I could take its place.</p>
<p>"Nasty, wicked boy," Jan continued. I wondered if she had even an inkling of how much power she had over me in that moment. "Watching your big sister get off."</p>
<p>I figured she probably wanted me to talk back but when I started, she shushed me.</p>
<p>"Bad enough you're rubbing that big dick for me," Jan said, "Watching me make myself feel so good." That last word devolved into a low groan. A throaty "ohhhhhhhhh" that, on top of an already incredible performance, might have been the sexiest thing I'd heard yet.</p>
<p>We sat there, getting ourselves off. The room filled with our shared grunts and groans. The slicking sound of my palm stroking loose skin. The droning hum of my sister stimulating her clit.</p>
<p>"You getting close, little brother?" Jan asked, "You going to cum? Naughty boy spurting his stuff in front of his sister?"</p>
<p>I could only nod my head in agreement.</p>
<p>"OK," Jan said, "Let it all out. It's OK, it's our secret. I won't tell. It's OK to let your sister see.... OH! OhhhhhhhhhhOH!"</p>
<p>Jan shuddered. She shook. With a trembling hand, she reached up for her left nipple and squeezed it, hard. Her bright blue eyes rolled back in her head. Her legs went stiff as her toes curled back and her whole body clenched.</p>
<p>It was more than I could take, and I erupted. The pleasure raced through me sharp as lightning and full as thunder. An arc of white spurted across our bodies, landing on Jan's leg.</p>
<p>I thought she'd get grossed out, but as my sperm hit her flesh, Jan's orgasm seemed to go to another level. She choked out a little ecstatic sob. My next shot, I didn't see where it went. The bliss overwhelmed me, and I lost track of anything except the pumping, pulsing pleasure as it engulfed me, body and soul.</p>
<p>When my eyes gained focus, I found myself gasping for air. My dick was slowly softening in my hand. Sticky from my spend.</p>
<p>Jan was staring at me, a bemused expression on her face. A strand of her dark hair had escaped her bun and she blew it away from her eyes, only for it to settle back where it'd been before. She let out a little sigh.</p>
<p>"Well, that was fascinating," Jan said, "Let me get you a tissue."</p>
<p>I could tell Jan's normally serious nature, her mask of indifference, was slowly slipping back on. But it was incongruent with the way she stumbled around her dark bedroom looking for a box of Kleenex. Finally, she handed me a wad. She took some for herself and I watched her run it from her calf to her thigh.</p>
<p>"You let out a lot," Jan said, "You must have been super backed up."</p>
<p>I didn't have the heart to tell her that, actually, this was already the second time I'd spent with a sibling that day. Instead, I just nodded. I was weirdly proud of myself for cumming so much. Like I'd accomplished something laudable solely by producing copious semen on command.</p>
<p>"Whew! I needed that," Jan said. She chuckled, a soft thing, then lay back down in bed.</p>
<p>I stared at my sister, a bit in awe. She went back to reading her book. Her face so expressionless. And yet the woman I'd seen a moment before was still there, right beneath the surface. It was so fucking hot, yet also oddly intimate.</p>
<p>"Have a good night," Jan said.</p>
<p>It was the only post-mortem I'd ever get from her. I stumbled back to my bedroom, shell shocked. My God. Whatever I'd pictured when Jan had pulled me into her bedroom after catching us. Well, it certainly wasn't that.</p>
<p>There was no doubt in my mind now, the next few weeks were going to be an epic experience.</p>
<p>The next few weeks were boring as hell.</p>
<p>Like Lucy had predicted in her car that morning, we all got swallowed up in the responsibilities of school, work, and life. Lucy, Lindsay and I would press every couple of days (we were busy, not insane). Two more times, Jan called me into her room on a quiet night and we rubbed off in front of each other. But my sister kept her panties on, left her crazy dildo in her drawer, and barely made a sound. Even as she climaxed.</p>
<p>If I'm making it all sound banal that's because, honestly, it kind of was. Well, in the moment it was hot as hell. It was still masturbating with my sister. But, similar to the pressing I did with Lucy and Lindsay, it felt both very rushed and also quite routine. Like brushing our teeth together or something like that. If anything, jerking off with Jan made me feel more like a prop, a porn video she could call up at will, then swipe away once she was finished. I can't say I wasn't using her the same way.</p>
<p>At the same time, like my mind had been partitioned, I couldn't stop thinking about what had happened that first night -- the dirty talk and all that. I know that sounds ludicrous. We were, literally, getting off together. And I was rubbing it out with my two other siblings every few days, as well.</p>
<p>But I spent a good amount of my free time fantasizing about all the other stuff we could be doing when we actually had time to enjoy it. That's beyond covetous, it's fucking crazy. But knowing that and stopping it are two different things. As any addict will tell you.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>I think part of it was the anticipation. In that way, it was almost fun. Before, when my sisters and I had hit dry spells, I'd worried we might be reaching the end of our adventures. But this time I had no doubt we'd be back to doing things as soon as school let out. I just wanted that time to come as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, as the holidays grew closer -- as midterms finished and classes closed, and a light dusting of snow covered the roads in anticipation of Santa's arrival -- we all started to awaken from our sexual slumber. Like a group of incest-obsessed, libido-driven, hibernating bears awakening to meet the dawn.</p>
<p>Two days before the break, Lindsay caught my arm as we did the post-dinner dishes. She didn't have to say a word, I could see what she wanted by the glint in her eye. But, being my younger sister, she said it anyway. Right out loud.</p>
<p>"I want to do our thing," Lindsay said. Her fingernails bit into my bicep, right through my sweater. Instinctively, I looked around for Lucy (we'd been kind of a package deal), but my older sister was out with friends. "Just us is OK."</p>
<p>"What thing is that exactly?" Mom asked, eyebrow arching in a mirror of her oldest daughter.</p>
<p>Like I said, Lindsay and I were standing right there in the kitchen. And my little sister had been none too quiet about her request. Talking loudly over the running water and all. God, but Lindsay had a way of getting us in trouble.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she also had the ability to talk herself right back out of it.</p>
<p>"Videogames," Lindsay said, flightily, tilting her head.</p>
<p>"I thought you didn't like that stuff," Mom said, "You gave me that whole speech about how it's all empty and meaningless. Spiritually bankrupt." My mom did air quotes as she spoke the last two words.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but then Dylan showed me this neat game where you grow vegetables and you have to collect different seeds, but they only grow during select seasons and they change each day so..."</p>
<p>And my sister was off to the races. I don't know if her rambling was on purpose or just the way her brain worked but it didn't matter because in moments it was clear our mom had completely checked out of the conversation. It was such a good cover that I could almost forgive my sister for causing the chaos in the first place.</p>
<p>Once Mom was subdued, we finished washing and Lindsay led me up to her bedroom. She carefully closed the door, then flopped down on the floor. Without even a preamble, my little sister took her top off. Now she only had on a purple sports bra with striped, black-and-white yoga pants.</p>
<p>"Come on Dylan, don't waste time," Lindsay said, "I need your energy to weave with mine."</p>
<p>"Uh huh," I said, not buying into my sister's mumbo jumbo any more than I needed to get off. "Everything?"</p>
<p>"Heck yeah, everything!" Lindsay said. She pulled her bra up over her head, revealing her little, pinkish breasts. Then she stripped off her bottoms as well, leaving her completely bare. Lindsay's pussy was completely shaved; it looked so full and welcoming. Damn, my baby sister had a great body. Lithe like a sculpture, yet soft and warm and oh-so-sexy.</p>
<p>Lindsay let out a little happy gasp when my dick popped free. She reached out to grab it, instinctual, but stopped herself. I tilted my head at her, but my little sister didn't explain. Instead, she brushed her impossibly long brown hair out of her eyes, reached between her legs, and started rubbing.</p>
<p>"That looks so good, Dylan," Lindsay said. Her green eyes focused on my dick like it was the center of the universe.</p>
<p>"You look so good," I said. I know, again, judging my vocabulary while my dick is in my hands isn't the fairest thing in the world.</p>
<p>It didn't take long for either of us to get off. Lindsay let out her usual high-pitched squeak as her body folded in on itself. I wasn't far after, spurting hot seed all over my sister's incredible little body.</p>
<p>"Oh Goddess," Lindsay groaned, "I can't wait to have your stuff inside me."</p>
<p>The next morning, one day before break, Lucy jutted her chin at me over breakfast. I couldn't hide my confusion. My older sister couldn't possibly mean she wanted a press. Sure, my parents and Jan had already hit the road. But didn't we have school?</p>
<p>"My finals are finished," Lucy said, "And you don't have a test till this afternoon."</p>
<p>"Oh," I said, "Right." Was it weird that my sister knew my schedule better than me? Was it weirder that that wasn't even in the top five of weird things between me and my sister? "But what about Lindsay?"</p>
<p>"She told me she already got hers last night."</p>
<p>I did my best not to blush. "Still, don't we have to drive her to class?"</p>
<p>Lucy's mouth quirked, but it quickly shifted into a big, dirty grin. "Yes," my older sister said, "Yes we do."</p>
<p>The three of us got in the car. Lindsay didn't question why it took two siblings to take her to school. Maybe it was my imagination, but she seemed a little spacier after our evening session. Like the lingering fumes of her orgasm were still leaking out of her.</p>
<p>After we let Lindsay go, Lucy headed back home. But after my older sister took a few turns in a different direction, we found ourselves rolling down a quiet road. I recognized we were going towards the nearby nature preserve. Though I didn't think Lucy was looking to go bird watching.</p>
<p>We turned down a gravel path and parked in a spot on the side of the road. It was early in the morning on a weekday; the little lot was empty. Lucy switched off her car and stepped out, stretching in the frigid air. I climbed out on the other side and eyed her.</p>
<p>Lucy was wearing a long white coat that went down past her knees. She had on a matching, knit white hat. Her blonde hair hung down in braids on either side of her face. Lucy's cheeks were already ruddy, making her blue eyes seem to sparkle even more than usual. It was cold enough that I could see her breath.</p>
<p>We trudged down a rock path, past bare trees and snow-dusted rocks. Our footsteps crunched loudly on brown leaves. The place was beyond empty; even the animals had decamped for the season.</p>
<p>Turning past a boulder taller than the two of us combined, we came to a tiny, open picnic area. Several wooden tables were scattered next to rusty, metal barbecue stands. The clearing was surrounded by tall, thin trees.</p>
<p>The scene was peaceful, quiet, but my sister was anything but. Lucy shoved me back onto the top of a picnic table. She reached for my belt, and in seconds, my pants and boxers were around my ankles. The wooden table felt icy on my bare butt. But my cock knew what was coming and was already at attention. I swear I could see steam coming off it.</p>
<p>Lucy stood over me. She unbuttoned her coat but left it on. Then she stepped out of her pants. My older sister's amazing blonde pussy was right in front of my face. Despite everything we'd done, I'd never gotten a good look before. Like my other sisters', it was perfect (and I'm aware of what a weird thought all that is).</p>
<p>For a moment, I thought Lucy was about to full-on mount me, breaking a barrier we'd set up months before. But my older sister wasn't all the way back to that place. Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>Lucy did climb on top of me, but her head was by my crotch, putting her sweet, soft sex in the right place for my tongue. There was no need for further explanation. We went at each other like we were crazed. Wild.</p>
<p>The cold had a part in it for sure. Every time my dick slipped from Lucy's warm mouth, I swore it was going to freeze right off. But it was more than that. We needed each other. Craved the lewd, depraved intimacy of it. The wet, loud, sloppy slurping that removed any doubt that we were animals in heat.</p>
<p>Before, Lucy had cleaned my dick after Lindsay had sucked me off. But she'd never actually given me head. My cock had been in my sister's pussy but never my tongue. Yet the two of us plunged into oral pleasures in public like practiced savants. We brought each other off with the ardor of the starving. When my sister came -- her clit jammed under my tongue -- her shout echoed through the thin winter air. My own cum spurted out of me, hot, soon after. Lucy gulp, gulp, gulped it all down.</p>
<p>We lay on top of each other, panting. Suddenly, I felt exceptionally cold. Lucy leapt off me and threw on her pants. I did the same and we raced, shivering, back to the car. Lucy laughing hysterically as she fumbled the keys to finally fire up the engine. She blasted the heat as high as she could.</p>
<p>I looked over at my sister, trembling. She shot me a similar expression. This was utter madness. Complete, ecstatic, blissful insanity. I didn't ever want to let it go. The heat finally kicked in and I stopped shaking. Lucy sucked in a deep breath and let it out as a sigh. As we stared out the windshield, a few snowflakes drifted languidly onto the glass.</p>
<p>"I'm happy," Lucy said out of nowhere.</p>
<p>"Anything in particular?"</p>
<p>"No," Lucy said, "All of it. None of it. The last few years have been... I'm just happy."</p>
<p>"Me too."</p>
<p>Another pause. Lucy seemed to be tumbling something around in her mind. Finally, she oriented it in a way she was comfortable with and let it slide out.</p>
<p>"Remember Randy Hotguy?"</p>
<p>"That dude you had a crush on at school?" I remembered him.</p>
<p>Lucy had brought him up as an example of someone she thought about when we pressed, back in the beginnings of all this. She didn't know his name, he was a random hot guy, so we named him that. Kind of as a joke.</p>
<p>"He asked me out yesterday."</p>
<p>"Really? That's, um. Yeah, wow. That's great."</p>
<p>"I turned him down," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"What? Why?"</p>
<p>"You know why."</p>
<p>I supposed that I did. But we weren't supposed to say those things out loud, were we?</p>
<p>"Look, I don't know what this is," Lucy said, gesturing between the two of us "But I know that I want it."</p>
<p>"Me too," I said. I hadn't even realized it till that moment. But I knew that it was true. It couldn't be love, not between siblings. Not in that way. But here we were, and I didn't ever want it to end.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"And everything else? All the stuff that comes with it?" Lucy asked.</p>
<p>"We'll figure it out," I said, more confident than I felt. "What about Lindsay?"</p>
<p>"What about her?" Lucy asked. She flipped down the sunshade and opened the mirror, checking her face for any evidence of my spend.</p>
<p>"I guess she's part of this now," I said, "We all are." I didn't dare say the J-name out loud. At least, not yet.</p>
<p>"I don't mind Lindsay," Lucy said. A little smile played on her face. "As long we're, you know, us."</p>
<p>"Lindsay wants to have sex," I said, "Not just what we've been doing. You know. All the way. She keeps talking about it."</p>
<p>"Well, I mean. I don't know if it's a good idea," I said, "She wants me to do it. To finish. You know, in her."</p>
<p>"I don't blame her," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"You don't think it's, like, a bad idea?" I asked, "Beyond the sibling thing. What with the risk and all?"</p>
<p>"I think it's none of my business what you and Lindsay do together," Lucy said.</p>
<p>I gave my sister a jaundiced eye.</p>
<p>"Fine," Lucy said, "I guess what I mean is, it's not up to me. But personally? I think you should go for it."</p>
<p>"Seriously?"</p>
<p>"You've done almost everything else with her," Lucy said, "What's the big deal, honestly?"</p>
<p>"Even after what happened with you and me? When I... When we almost..."</p>
<p>"I think a lot about that too," Lucy said, "I have a lot of regrets."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," I said, "I screwed up. I'm so stupid. I can't tell you how awful I feel about all of it. The danger I put us in."</p>
<p>"Stop," Lucy said. She put her fingers on my lips. "The only thing I feel bad about is that we stopped."</p>
<p>That night, I couldn't sleep. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, searching for answers to questions I didn't even know how to ask. My hot younger sister (who was very much not on birth control) was outright demanding intercourse. My gorgeous older sister was straight up searching for a real relationship. Both requests felt impossibly foolish yet undeniably inescapable. I should have felt like I won the lottery. Two beautiful women wanted to be with me and neither minded the other, to boot. But don't most lottery winners also end up horribly depressed and miserable?</p>
<p>My phone buzzed and I looked down. For some reason, it showed me the text that Jan had sent two weeks before.</p>
<p>"Come."</p>
<p>Then I realized -- my phone wasn't notifying me about an old message. I'd gotten a new one. I popped out of bed like it was burning hot.</p>
<p>The house was silent. Everything was pitch dark. The next day was Christmas Eve, and I could make out a few branches of our undecorated tree at the end of the hall. I turned to my oldest sister's bedroom before I got there -- I knew a much better present was waiting inside.</p>
<p>Once again, I found Jan in bed, reading a book. She had her dark hair up in the usual bun and she was wearing her reading glasses. She had on a silky, black top that, if I didn't know any better, I'd swear was lingerie.</p>
<p>Jan nodded and took off her glasses when I came in. She slid out from under the covers to reveal a pair of matching dark shorts. She didn't say a word, just sashayed over to the desk chair and put it into place. Then she reached into her drawer and pulled out her lavender companion. I smiled and, this time, it wasn't from mirth. I was legitimately happy to see the fellow. It meant that I wasn't here for a quick stroke. We were going to have FUN.</p>
<p>As if to confirm my thoughts, Jan stood up and immediately stripped down. I hadn't seen her naked the last time and it was, truly, a revelation. Jan didn't have Lindsay's toned tummy. And she lacked Lucy's massive breasts. But my oldest sister's body was beyond what I could have imagined. Her breasts were full, yet perky. Her hips flared out at a perfect curve. Her long legs and trim flank -- it was like finding a goddess living in my sister's bedroom.</p>
<p>As a grand finale, Jan reached back and undid her hair. It fell past her shoulders in waves like liquid onyx.</p>
<p>Fuck. Me.</p>
<p>"What?" Jan tilted her head. She'd caught me drooling, no doubt.</p>
<p>I responded by stepping out of my own clothes. There was nothing I could say that would explain to my oldest sister exactly what she'd shown me. And while I knew my own body couldn't compete, it was the only card I had to play. Fortunately, Jan eyed my dick with the same perverted wonder that I'd just given her. She grinned, wickedly.</p>
<p>Jan sat down on her desk chair, spreading her legs like a swan's wings. She dipped her dildo to her clit, then flicked it on. The room filled with a buzz and a gasp.</p>
<p>I took my place on Jan's bed, facing her. My cock firmly in hand. I gave it only the most cursory of strokes. I was going to enjoy this show for as long as possible. Plus, I had another plan in mind. One I'd been working on for the last two weeks, hoping I'd get another shot at this.</p>
<p>"Such a naughty sister," I said.</p>
<p>Jan's eyes went wide. Her leg kicked.</p>
<p>"Bad little girl, showing your little brother your pussy."</p>
<p>She gasped. Her eyes rolled back. Just like that, a few well-placed words, and already I'd made my sister cum. A tiny one to be sure, but no less magnificent for all that it meant.</p>
<p>"You like that, little perv? Watching me cum?" Jan asked. Her azure eyes were alight -- now that it was clear that I got the game, it was time to take the gloves off and play.</p>
<p>"Sick sister, you want your baby brother's cock, don't you?" I started to stroke myself faster, practically waving my dick at my sister like a scarlet cape at a bull. "You're not supposed to want that."</p>
<p>"Gross brother, staring at sissy's pussy," Jan snarled, "You want to -- OH! -- stick it in me, don't you? That's incest."</p>
<p>"You wish," I said, "You'd love to feel your brother's long, thick cock fill your forbidden cunt. You're practically pissing on the floor you want it so bad."</p>
<p>"Oh... OH!" Jan's legs kicked out. She reached with her free hand and pinched her left tit purple. She let out a long, anguished squeal of delight as her orgasm overtook her. This wasn't the little bump of before, it was a mountain. And my older sister howled as she soared off the cliffside.</p>
<p>By the time she came down, she was bathed in sweat and her own slick juices. Her thighs shiny. Dark hair stuck to the side of her face. Jan dropped her dildo to the floor. She looked beaten, but her eyes were so intense -- so filled with erotic energy -- they looked ready to power a whole city block.</p>
<p>"Do it," Jan said, her voice ragged and thin. "Cum on your sick sister. Cover me with your thick, incestuous seed."</p>
<p>I jammed at my cock with abandon. All my patience from before was working against me. I stood up, pointing my dick in Jan's face. Stroked like an animal.</p>
<p>"You want that brother dick," I said. Forcing out each word felt like a phenomenal effort. "That sibling spend. You want my load on your face. On your tits. In your unprotected pussy."</p>
<p>"Oh GOD!" Jan's legs kicked out. She hadn't even touched herself, but the orgasm showed up anyway. Her eyes rolled back in her head, hard.</p>
<p>My own ecstasy grabbed hold of me. I spurted onto my sister. A thick glob of pearlescence spattered her right on her face. The next hit lower, on her lovely breast.</p>
<p>"Uhn...naughty boy." Jan gasped out. "Cumming all over your big sister."</p>
<p>Jan tumbled out of the chair and onto the floor, still shaking on the ground. I stood over her, as if my sister was a precious flower and I was watering her with my cum. Like she was an inferno, and this was the only way to put her out.</p>
<p>I lowered myself to the ground next to Jan. My cock was now soft and sticky in my hand. The bliss continued to roll over me. We sat there on the hard, wood floor. Barely touching. Glorifying in our shared ecstasy.</p>
<p>My breath slowed. The orgasm drained out of me. I felt awkward but satiated. Jan snuggled up next to me. She wrapped her long arms around my shoulders. I tried to think of the last time my oldest sister had hugged me. The only answer I could come up with was 'never.'</p>
<p>"Such a good little brother," Jan said. She kissed my cheek, lightly. I realized she smelled a bit like licorice. "Making your big sister feel so good."</p>
<p>Jan let go of me and climbed back onto the bed. I started to make my way to the door. I don't know why it all came to me at once, how odd all this was. Lucy and I had always been close. Even before the pressing. So, it felt natural to me, in a very unnatural way, that we'd fallen into things together.</p>
<p>With Lindsay, I don't know. I guess that didn't make much sense either. But my younger sister had a way of making upside down seem right side up. It was merely a matter of seeing things from her perspective. Of course we'd fool around. Whyever not?</p>
<p>I couldn't say the same with Jan and I guess that got to me. Was this just fun? Or something far more dangerous?</p>
<p>"What are we doing here, really?" I asked my oldest sister.</p>
<p>I turned around to face her. She was under the covers. Her black hair was already back in its bun. Her nose buried in her book. Jan cocked her eyebrow in that signature expression of hers. Like a sexy Mr. Spock.</p>
<p>"We're masturbating?" Jan said.</p>
<p>"Yes, I get that," I said, "I mean, like, what are we doing?"</p>
<p>Jan let out a long sigh, like I was the most exasperating person in the whole universe. As if my question wasn't actually so overloaded with merit that it might tip us all over.</p>
<p>"I'm stuck home," Jan said, "I have nothing to do except work. And seeing you, Lindsay, and Lucy together? Well, I guess you three found a way to make the time pass. Better than reading books, anyway."</p>
<p>"It has its benefits," I said, with a wry smile.</p>
<p>"So why can't I enjoy it, too?" Jan asked.</p>
<p>I nodded my head. That made sense in a very Jan way.</p>
<p>"So, this is all because you're bored," I said, "And a little jealous?"</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"Something like that," Jan said, like that was the most natural response in the world. "You don't have to worry about feelings with me, Dylan. I don't do angry or jealous or sad. I don't come with those settings. You know that better than maybe anyone."</p>
<p>"So, there's nothing more to this," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes, my evil plan to ensnare my younger brother," Jan said, tenting her fingers like an animated maniac, "Please. I don't even know how that would play out. I saw you guys doing something and I wanted in. Nothing more. OK?"</p>
<p>"Besides," my oldest sister said with a wicked grin, "It's fun to be bad."</p>
<p>I blinked awake the next morning, feeling warm and cozy. I heard voices coming from downstairs. The thought raced into my mind: it was Christmas Eve. I'd made it.</p>
<p>This wasn't the big day, but that didn't matter. Lindsay's school was closed. Lucy and I were done with classes. Jan's office was shut till after New Year's. We were about to have an absolute orgy of incestuous delights. Santa could crash into a mountain for all I cared.</p>
<p>The voices from downstairs got louder. I realized that I wasn't hearing the soft sounds of family celebrating the upcoming holiday. They were shouting. Arguing. This was a full-on fight.</p>
<p>Despite my better judgement, I spilled out of bed, pulled on PJ pants and a white t-shirt, and raced downstairs. I found my entire family in the living room, standing on opposite sides like they were spoiling for a brawl.</p>
<p>My father was already halfway out the door. Mom trailed behind him.Jan, Lindsay, and Lucy were on the other side of the living room. Everyone turned to look at me when I reached the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" I asked, stupidly.</p>
<p>"All of you need to learn to be grateful for what you have!" Mom screeched. She and Dad slammed the door behind them. I swore I could hear them storming down the front steps. Even the rumble of Dad's car sounded angry as he drove off.</p>
<p>The living room was silent. I turned to look at my sisters.</p>
<p>"What just happened?" I asked, again being dumb.</p>
<p>"I offered to help decorate the tree," Lucy said. Her blue eyes were wide. Her bottom lip trembled.</p>
<p>"Dad went batshit," Jan said. She was holding a cup of coffee in her hand so hard it was shaking slightly. Her fingers were white with the tension of it.</p>
<p>"I noticed," I said.</p>
<p>"Seriously, that was nuts," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>"Lucy offered to help decorate the tree," Jan said, "Like she said."</p>
<p>"Then Dad lost it," Lindsay said, "Started shouting about how we should be happy with what we have."</p>
<p>Lucy sniffled. "I didn't mean it that way, I swear. I just wanted to be helpful."</p>
<p>"We know," Jan said, firmly. She'd told me the day before she didn't 'do' angry. Well, she sure seemed pissed off in that moment. "Dad went into this whole rant about how we all need to respect his hard work and stop being 'ungrateful little...' Well, you know."</p>
<p>"It got worse from there," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>"Seriously?" I asked.</p>
<p>All three sisters nodded.</p>
<p>"He said a lot of hurtful things," Lucy said, "About us being spoiled and selfish and, um, stuff."</p>
<p>"I'd happily go to work," I said, "He's the one that forbid us from doing it."</p>
<p>"Well, apparently he's angry about it, anyway," Jan said, "Along with a host of other crap."</p>
<p>"What did Mom do?" I asked.</p>
<p>"You saw that part," Lindsay said, "She took his side. Repeated everything he said and piled on."</p>
<p>"All because Lucy offered to help with the tree," I said, shaking my head.</p>
<p>"I'm pretty sure this is about more than Christmas," Jan said.</p>
<p>Lucy slumped against the wall, looking distraught. "I swear I didn't mean it," she mumbled to herself.</p>
<p>"So, what do we do now?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I'll apologize to them both when they get home," Lucy said.</p>
<p>Jan rolled her eyes. "We already did that, and it didn't do anything."</p>
<p>"So what do you suggest?" Lucy asked.</p>
<p>"Girls, we're not going to get anywhere better by fighting each other," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>"Dad's being a dick and Mom's acting like an ass," Jan said, "There's nothing we can do. Just wait for them to cool off."</p>
<p>That didn't seem like much of a solution. If anything, it felt like that was only going to make things fester further. But I didn't feel like it was my place to tell my sisters what to do.</p>
<p>So, instead, we all sat in the living room, looking at each other like we'd been through a bombing. Which I suppose was sort of true. We stayed that way for a while, saying very little. I was confused, bewildered. The girls were all devastated. A poisonous mix of embarrassment, regret, and indignance (you can probably guess who was what).</p>
<p>What should have been a celebration now felt like a funeral.</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the day quiet, like tiptoeing through a crime scene. I didn't need to study, but I stayed in my room anyway. I thought about everything I'd been anticipating. All I could hope was that a few hours would pass, and my family would be in a better place.</p>
<p>My parents came home, and we had a chaste, uncomfortable dinner. Lucy spoke up to apologize, but Dad waved her off.</p>
<p>"Don't bother," he said, with all the aggression of a threat. Mom glared at us over our forkfuls.</p>
<p>Christmas morning, I thought we'd see things thaw. But no such luck. We opened our gifts quietly, in corners, then shuffled off to our rooms. The day before, I'd thought that maybe this would blow over and we'd be back to fooling around. Now, I wasn't sure if we'd already ended the holiday before it barely had a chance to start. My most anticipated week was looking like it was going to be nothing more than a long march through misery. God help me, I actually started to look forward to going back to school.</p>
<p>That afternoon, with the house so quiet you'd think it was empty, I was watching videos on my phone when it buzzed. I swiped over to the text app.</p>
<p>Another message from Jan. Actually, the same message from Jan. I had three of them now.</p>
<p>Come</p>
<p>Come</p>
<p>Come</p>
<p>There was something seriously dirty about it (I could hear my sister in my head, chanting those words), and for the first time in days, I actually smiled.</p>
<p>For a moment, I stopped myself. Things were already tense. Was this really such a great idea? Then I realized: things were so tense, this was a fantastic idea!</p>
<p>Carefully, I opened my door and slipped down the hall. I doubted anyone was going to notice, but getting caught now felt like it carried extra consequences. I had on sweatpants and a t-shirt. I guess, if someone saw me, I could say I was going to the bathroom.</p>
<p>I opened my oldest sister's door. She was sitting on the edge of the bed, staring at me, seriously. I wondered if she'd been waiting that way the whole time. Jan had on the same, black lingerie from the time before. On my sister, it looked oddly professional. Like she could have worn the outfit to the office, if she chose.</p>
<p>Like an overdue Christmas miracle, my cock sprang to life. Jan's face broke into a grin. She shucked off her shorts. I took off my pants. Was this going to be one of our quickies or would we take the time to play around?</p>
<p>"Bad little brother," Jan said, "Making me touch your cock."</p>
<p>Sure enough, my oldest sister reached out and grabbed my dong, pulling me within comfortable reach. She stroked me up and down.</p>
<p>"Do it, sis," I said, my brain racing to take in all of what this meant. "Make me feel good."</p>
<p>"Oh, but it's so wrong," Jan said, "Stroking off my brother."</p>
<p>I reached for Jan's breasts beneath her silky top. The slipperiness of them under the silk was something else. I found her nipples and pinched, slightly. Jan groaned.</p>
<p>"Bad... little... brother..."</p>
<p>I wasn't going to last long in my oldest sister's grasp. The talking, the unfamiliarity of her fingers, the way her oh-so-serious face was twisted with desire -- she didn't need much skill to get me off. The fact that Jan was also, actually fantastic at this was the cherry on top of our incestuous sundae.</p>
<p>Jan reached behind her, where her violet friend was waiting. She took the dildo with her free hand and started to work it into her pussy. The buzzing monstrosity stretched her nether lips, lewdly. Oh my God. It was happening. All of it.</p>
<p>I was going to cum any second. Would Jan let me spray on her chest? Her face? And what then? Was I going to finger my oldest sister's pussy? Or even better, get her off with my tongue? I was so entranced by all the possibilities of what was about to happen, that I lost track of what was going on in the moment.</p>
<p>Until I heard a gasp.</p>
<p>It wasn't one of pleasure, or desire. A short, sharp, high-pitched intake of breath. It didn't come from Jan. The sound led my eyes to the bedroom door. It was cracked open. A pair of green eyes stared back at me. Mouth open in shock.</p>
<p>Lindsay.</p>
<p>My cock went from 60 to 0 in seconds. From about to cum to completely soft. Shit.</p>
<p>"What?" Jan looked up at me. Then back at the door. Our eyes met. Both of us thinking the same exact thing.</p>
<p>Shit. Shit. Shit.</p>
<p>I threw on my pants and scrambled out of Jan's room. I went right to Lindsay's door and knocked. No response. I was about to shout her name, but I stopped myself. This was already so, so bad. Drawing attention only made things way worse.</p>
<p>I walked back to Jan's room, dejected. My sister was dressed and sitting back on her bed; the perfect expression of disinterest.</p>
<p>"What have we done?" I asked her.</p>
<p>She didn't have an answer for me.</p>
<p>I'm sure you're thinking that it wasn't that big of a deal. How could Lindsay be upset about catching me doing something that she, herself, had been up to?</p>
<p>But that was sort of the problem right there. Lindsay and I had been doing all kinds of dirty stuff together. We had an implied trust, if not an overt one. And I'd shattered it by not sharing what was going on with Jan. Having a threesome with your wife doesn't also give you permission to have a mistress on the side. In fact, it makes the betrayal feel all the deeper.</p>
<p>"Let me explain," I said, the next morning over breakfast.</p>
<p>"There's no need," Lucy said, looking protectively over at Lindsay. Apparently, my sisters had shared the news.</p>
<p>"It's just, Jan and I..."</p>
<p>"I saw everything about you and Jan," Lindsay spat.</p>
<p>"I should have said something," I said, "Before."</p>
<p>"Whatever," Lucy said. She and Lindsay both glared at me in the exact same way. It was uncanny in a very upsetting way. "Don't let us stop you."</p>
<p>As bad as the day before had felt, this was worse. For one thing, I was right in the center of it this time. But moreso, what happened with our parents was upsetting but not permanent. Hell, half of me was convinced that the whole reason all of this sibling-sex-stuff had started was as a way of feeling better about our situation with Mom and Dad.</p>
<p>But getting caught with Jan had more a direct effect on our activities. Our trust. Time wouldn't heal it and apologies didn't help. I'd managed to mess things up even worse.</p>
<p>When I went to talk to Jan about it, she shut me out, too. "I think it's better for us to let things cool off for a bit," she explained, before closing her door in my face.</p>
<p>I didn't need a translation to know that 'a bit' meant 'for the rest of our natural lives.'</p>
<p>And just like that, everything we'd been heading towards was gone -- poof! -- like an oasis flipping back to endless desert.</p>
<p>The holiday week dragged on. Every day was a reminder of what should have been but wasn't. I tried a few more times to talk to my sisters, but they completely shut me out. It's not like I didn't understand what I'd done. I just desperately wanted, needed, to fix things. And Lucy, Lindsay, and Jan made it clear -- I couldn't.</p>
<p>The thing with my parents didn't untangle itself either. Mom and Dad rededicated themselves to work and when they were home, everything felt like dry tinder. Like even the smallest spark would lead to an explosion. So mostly we ignored each other. Not talking, by the way, really helps make relationships work. Like gasoline on a fire.</p>
<p>I spent as much time separated as I could. In my room or out for walks. Most of my friends had moved away from town and the ones that hadn't, well, what would we talk about, exactly? The fact that I was back at home instead of away for school? Or that our family was broke and barely getting by? Or how about the fact that my mutual masturbation club with my sisters had imploded? Yes, I was better off by myself for sure.</p>
<p>Finally, on Friday, I got a knock on my bedroom door. Lucy was standing there, eyeing me coldly. She had on a blue sweater that accentuated her eyes. I couldn't hide the relief on my face at seeing her.</p>
<p>I was so surprised to see my buxom blonde sister, that I forgot how to speak. Before I could sputter out my apology/explanation/plead for mercy, Lucy spoke.</p>
<p>"I don't want to talk about it," Lucy said, straight off.</p>
<p>"We got an invite from Kara," Lucy said. Her affect stayed flat.</p>
<p>Kara was Lucy's best friend from high school. I'd had a crush on her, and it turned out, she was maybe interested in me, as well. Over Thanksgiving, we'd kinda, sorta, accidentally introduced her to our incestuous playtime. I hadn't heard from her since, though, and I assumed it was because she'd had doubts about everything we'd done. I wouldn't blame her.</p>
<p>"She's having a big holiday party at her house," Lucy continued, "She invited all of us, even Jan."</p>
<p>"Even me?"</p>
<p>"Especially you," Lucy said. The disdain stayed stamped on her face.</p>
<p>"It's fine, you guys have fun," I said. I went to shut the door.</p>
<p>"Dylan," Lucy caught it before I could close it. For a moment, I saw a bit of worry slip out.</p>
<p>"I know, OK," I said, "I know. I fucked up. Big time. With all of you. Just have fun. I'll be fine."</p>
<p>"We're all super upset right now," Lucy said, "But that doesn't mean I... Look, Kara specifically asked me to invite you. I'm angry, sure, but I'm not cruel. She wants you there. And I think it'll be nice if we all go."</p>
<p>"Will it help if I let you smash my head into a wall while we're there?" I asked.</p>
<p>Lucy smiled, like she didn't want to but couldn't stop herself. "It's worth a try."</p>
<p>All four of us piled into Jan's car and she drove us to the party. Yes, even my oldest sister agreed to go. I think we all wanted out of the house. On top of what I'd done, the incident with our parents was still looming over us. A chance to pretend at normality for a while really appealed. Or, at least the opportunity to get sloppy drunk.</p>
<p>I was wearing a dark sweater with grey slacks. Lucy, Lindsay and Jan all had on dark dresses. We looked formal, like we were going to church rather than a celebration. I guess it matched our moods. For a moment, I let myself think that maybe everything would be OK. That this was a sign of the ice breaking.</p>
<p>Kara's house was massive. A mansion at the top of a hill on the end of a cul-de-sac. I'd known that Lucy's best friend was well to do, but this was ridiculous. Even when things had been going good for our family, it had never been like this.</p>
<p>We parked on the street and walked up to the door. The place was already jumping, Christmas music blaring. Flashing lights and one of those giant skeletons wearing a Santa hat on the lawn.</p>
<p>Kara, herself greeted us at the door. The cute brunette was wearing an ugly Rudolph sweater and with a reindeer horn headband. She gave us all hugs, saving an extra tight squeeze for me.</p>
<p>"I'm so happy you all made it," she said, still looking me in the eyes. I wish I could tell you that with everything else going on in my life, my body was unable to respond to this overt flirting. But I cannot.</p>
<p>Kara led us inside, pointing out where we could get drinks and how to find the bathroom. The place wasn't too crowded, but it'd take an army to make that house feel overstuffed.</p>
<p>When she was done, Kara grabbed Lucy's arm and led her back to the kitchen. My other sisters immediately split off, leaving me holding a red, plastic Solo cup and standing awkwardly in the living room. I found a couch to sit on and stared off into the distance.</p>
<p>I ran into a few people I recognized from high school. I had the same, awkward conversation with five different people. Yes, living back at home. No, County College wasn't too bad. No, no girlfriend. Yes, just hanging out and playing videogames.</p>
<p>However, it was sort of nice to socialize. People were very polite; far less judgy than I'd have imagined. A few were actually supportive. But it still mostly sucked.</p>
<p>At one point, I decided I wanted to go find Kara. Yes, I know it was self-interested and probably stupid. But the truth was, a girl I had a serious crush on had expressed interest and I wasn't going to give up the opportunity. Not so much despite what was happening with my siblings but because of it.</p>
<p>But, as I wandered the whole lower floor of the house, I couldn't find her. The woman who'd insisted I show up to her party, who'd flirted with me hard, was nowhere to be seen. I started to wonder at the whole setup. Why was I even here? Why had all my siblings been invited? None of it made sense.</p>
<p>I ended up downstairs in the finished basement, standing to the side and watching basketball on a big screen TV with about eight other dudes. It wasn't a game I cared about, but I must have gotten involved because I didn't notice I'd drawn someone's attention until I felt a hand on my elbow.</p>
<p>I turned to see a redheaded, fairly attractive, twenty-something woman in a shimmery, green dress. Her eyes lit up as I turned her way.</p>
<p>"You're Lucy's little brother, Dylan," she said.</p>
<p>I was surprised at her recognition. I didn't know her from high school, did I?</p>
<p>"No, I'm Wendy. Kenny's fiancee," she said, "He's Kara's older brother?"</p>
<p>"Oh right," I said, "Kara mentioned you both at Thanksgiving."</p>
<p>If Wendy had any idea about what had gone on over that holiday, she made no sign.</p>
<p>"I didn't realize Kara's brother was here," I said.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, the whole family wanted to host this," Wendy said, "Well, the parents are off in Cabo. But everyone else is around here somewhere. Actually, that's why I came over to talk to you. I was wondering if you'd seen Kenny anywhere. I haven't been able to find him."</p>
<p>"I haven't," I said, "I was actually looking for Kara before,e but I didn't find her either."</p>
<p>Somehow, I still didn't put it together.</p>
<p>Wendy and I shared a shrug and agreed to look for them together. We wandered around, weaving past unfamiliar faces, but we didn't see either sibling. Instead, we found mine. Jan, specifically.</p>
<p>"I'm over this," she told me, forcefully. She grabbed my elbow tight enough to hurt. As if I hadn't already gotten her message. "We need to find the Ells and the fuck out of here."</p>
<p>I gave Wendy a polite goodbye and let my oldest sister drag me along.</p>
<p>"I hate high school parties," Jan said, pulling me from room to room.</p>
<p>"I'm pretty sure everyone here is in college or older," I said.</p>
<p>"It's still a high school party," Jan said. I knew what she meant.</p>
<p>We found Lindsay out in the backyard, sitting on a folding chair in front of a stone firepit with about five other people. They were all passing a joint around. I thought for sure my younger sister would argue for more time, but she leapt out of her seat and hurried over as soon as she saw us.</p>
<p>"This place is getting my chi all tangled," Lindsay said, as if that was a basic observation. "Also, the pot sucks."</p>
<p>The three of us continued our methodical search of the house. I assumed we'd find Lucy with Kara, after all the two of them had gone off together. But instead, my buxom blonde sister was standing by herself in the kitchen, nursing a beer.</p>
<p>"Please tell me we're leaving," Lucy said, "I've been hit on by five different guys and the best pickup line by far was 'hey bitch, nice tits.'"</p>
<p>"That bad, huh?" I asked.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>"Do yourself a favor," Lucy said to me, "Don't ever be a girl."</p>
<p>"That's the best advice I've heard all night," Jan said.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry guys," Lucy said, "I thought this would be fun. A break from, well, everything."</p>
<p>"It's OK," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>"Honestly, this whole thing has been weird," Lucy continued, "Kara disappeared about a minute in, I haven't seen anyone I know. I'm not even sure why she bothered inviting us."</p>
<p>"Yeah, the whole thing's been odd," I said, "Like one long joke with no punchline."</p>
<p>"I'm pretty OK with missing the punchline," Jan said.</p>
<p>"I want to find Kara and thank her for inviting us," Lucy said, "Then we can go."</p>
<p>"Send her a text," Jan said, "Seriously."</p>
<p>"I'll feel guilty if we don't at least try," Lucy said, little-girl-pouty.</p>
<p>Jan let out a sigh but nodded her agreement.</p>
<p>We checked everywhere -- back to the finished basement, the formal dining room, some kind of conservatory -- Kara wasn't there. I was beginning to think she'd left the party entirely. On the plus side though, I now knew where to go if I wanted to host a live game of Clue.</p>
<p>Finally, we climbed the stairs and went down the dark hallway, past the bedrooms. Up here was oddly quiet. Weirdly foreboding. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach. Like the victim in a horror movie.</p>
<p>"We should go," I told Lucy, grabbing my sister's arm tightly.</p>
<p>We all walked forward anyway, as if inexorably pulled. The last door in the hall was cracked open. A pool of light spilled out. I swore I heard a rhythmic squeaking. Like a heartbeat but far too high pitched.</p>
<p>We could see into the room well before we got to the end. It looked like the parents' bedroom. Pictures of them lined the walls. A wedding day photo. A shot of them at sunset on a yacht. In the middle of the room, there was a king-sized bed on a massive mahogany frame. And that's where we finally found Kara.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what grabbed my attention first. It all hit me at once, like getting smacked by a fire hose. One huge burst and I was soaked with the knowledge of what I was seeing. I list it all in an order, but that doesn't truly cover how it came at my comprehension.</p>
<p>Kara was on all fours, completely naked. By her face, his dick forced lewdly into her mouth, was one man. He looked a bit younger than her. Behind her, his cock stuffed obscenely in her pussy, was another guy. He looked a bit older than Kara. And I knew, without doubt -- in that same very moment -- that both these boys were Kara's brothers.</p>
<p>Kevin was the one getting sucked off. Head back, eyes squeezed shut, while his older sister lapped and gulped on his dick with a kind of frenzied abandon. He held her head in place, needlessly. Pulling at her hair and ears. Grunting and gasping at every sloppy slurp.</p>
<p>Kenny, whose fiancee I'd met not so long before, was the one doing his baby sister from behind. He grabbed and slapped at her skinny butt while he threw himself into her with abandon. A kind of violent, aggressive plunging that looked more primal than fraternal.</p>
<p>Stupidly, my first thought was about the door. Did they accidentally leave it open? As if that was the most important aspect of what my sisters and I were witnessing. Like privacy was everyone's primary concern.</p>
<p>The two brothers fucked at their sister's holes wildly. Angrily. Using her in a way that actually made me viscerally uncomfortable. And Kara was clearly loving it.</p>
<p>The skinny brunette was mewling and moaning in concert with her brothers. She worshipped her brother's cock as it pummeled her throat. She arched her back and rolled her ass as her other brother plumbed her depths. As they pulled her hair and bruised her body, Kara seemed to thrum with pleasure.</p>
<p>"Fuck sis, your mouth feels so good," Kevin said.</p>
<p>"You should try her sweet, slutty pussy," Kenny gasped out.</p>
<p>"Nah, I'm gonna take her ass instead," Kevin said.</p>
<p>Those words triggered something in Kara. She spit out her brother's cock, trying to cry out. Her body bucked as an orgasm burst through her. As soon as the air was back in her lungs, her younger brother's cock was back in her mouth.</p>
<p>They were doing her from both ends. One, I'm pretty sure it was Kevin, had his cock in his older</p>
<p>I looked over at my sisters for the first time. All of them had the same looks of shock on their faces. There was something horrifyingly hypnotizing about the whole thing. Everything that was going on in front of us. Nothing made us stay. We couldn't find the way to leave.</p>
<p>It wasn't only the sibling similarities. How the three of them were twisted reflections of each other. The genetic material mixed between the three as they stirred their taboo stew.</p>
<p>It was more than the inherent wrongness of the act. Kenny's doting fiancee was right downstairs. He wasn't just fucking his sister, committing incest; he was cheating on his future wife as well. And sharing it all with his younger brother.</p>
<p>Plus, the violence of it. The hunger. The odd desperation of how all three of them gave into their need. It was wild, out of control. Watching it made me feel sick and wonderful all at once. Like eating too much icing where your teeth begin to ache.</p>
<p>I get what you're probably thinking: how could I feel revulsion at seeing something I was doing with my own sisters? Well, I could fig leaf the whole thing and say 'yeah, but we weren't fucking' which is factually accurate but actually false. We all knew where things had been heading.</p>
<p>In truth, I don't have a rational explanation except to say that doing a thing and watching someone else do it are two different things. I feel pretty safe in saying it that way, because I wasn't the only one taken aback. The looks on my sisters' faces all said the same exact thing.</p>
<p>Kevin didn't say a word when he reached his peak. He grabbed his older sister's head and shoved it forward. She choked. He bucked. Tears ran down her cheeks. Sperm leaked out of her mouth.</p>
<p>"Fuck yeah, sis," Kevin said, "Take it like a good little slut."</p>
<p>Kenny, however, made his next act abundantly clear.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna cum in your pussy!" he cried out.</p>
<p>"Yes!" Kara shouted, her mouth finally free. "Give your sister your load!"</p>
<p>"Oh FUCK!" Kenny said. He grabbed his sister's behind, shoving deep. His cock twitched as he pumped her full of seed. I was sure Kara was using protection, but some part of me felt the wrongness all the same.</p>
<p>Kara cried out as her brother's seed filled her. Kevin grunted with every burst. Even Kenny seemed to react, a little chuckle escaped his lips.</p>
<p>The siblings all settled onto the bed. Wrapped around each other with a tenderness they'd lacked before. I thought for sure they'd see us all standing at the doorway now, but they seemed lost in their own incestuous universe.</p>
<p>They kissed and cuddled, making warm cooing sounds. I thought perhaps that they were about to fall into an adorable nap. But then Kevin roused.</p>
<p>"OK sis," he said, getting up on his knees, "Time to fuck that juicy ass."</p>
<p>If Kara had any concerns, she didn't speak them. Kevin shoved her, roughly, onto the bed. He grabbed a container of moisturizing lotion from one of the nightstands. The bottle made a rude noise as he lubed himself and his sister's anus.</p>
<p>A moment later, Kara let out a scream like nothing I'd ever heard. Something so base and raw that it echoes in my ears to this day. Kevin had pierced his older sister's back hole. She cringed. Her whole body cinched. Her face went purple.</p>
<p>Kenny showed his concern by getting up and shoving his dick right in his younger sister's mouth.</p>
<p>"That's your pussy you're tasting," Kenny told Kara confidently. "And my cum."</p>
<p>Kara let out a needful, "Uh huh," then braced herself to get blissfully battered once again.</p>
<p>Something about this recombination, the ease with which the three of them reformed their spit roast, finally shook us free. Jan, Lucy, Lindsay and I both backed away from the door. The sounds still filling our ears.</p>
<p>Now that we knew what we were hearing, it all seemed incredibly obvious. Impossible that the party wasn't going to notice. But the hallway was completely empty. The world seemed determined to ignore what the siblings were up to.</p>
<p>"Oh my Goddess," Lindsay said as we stumbled down the hall. It came out as a breath. A startled, stifled prayer to a deity who couldn't possibly explain this any better than any of us could.</p>
<p>"I mean, we did do the thing. At Thanksgiving," Lucy said. She gave us all a guilty look. As if asking, is this our fault?</p>
<p>"What happened at Thanksgiving?" Jan asked.</p>
<p>I didn't know how to answer that. Nothing had happened. Everything had. The possibilities and permutations were too much for us to process. The four of us shared a look. Whatever little arousal we had left was drowned in disgust. And fear.</p>
<p>We'd seen ourselves there, through the funhouse mirror. The alternate universe version of ourselves. And what we'd witnessed hadn't been hot or awesome or sexy or any of the other ways I'd described fooling around with my sisters. It had been awful. All of us felt it, like we'd eaten rancid meat. Our mouths filling with acrid, awful bile.</p>
<p>And I knew in that moment, without a doubt, that everything we'd been doing was really, truly over.</p>
<p>Next time: It's not over.</p>


<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>So, Dylan and his three sisters (older siblings Jan and Lucy, younger sibling Lindsay) have all been fooling around in some form or another since the summer. But things got out of control during the holidays and now it seems like it's all coming to an end. So, prepare yourself for a few pages of sensible, sexless, sibling relationships where everyone decides to make smart, rational decisions about their lives.</p>
<p>Or not.</p>
<p>All participants are over the age of 18</p>
<p>"Dylan, come here," Lucy called me from her bedroom.</p>
<p>It was early March, and the family house was finally feeling warm. I remembered back to an earlier time when my sister had called me to her bedroom. The first time we'd pressed together. It'd been sweaty hot, and I'd mourned the new house's lack of air conditioning like a body that'd lost half its limbs.</p>
<p>Now, after a winter of snow and icy cold, all I could hope for was heat. It had been a long, dreary season; the snow still piled high. And yeah, apparently the house was terrible at staying warm, as well. It was the gift that kept on sucking.</p>
<p>"We should talk," Lucy said. She was sitting at her desk, her head buried in a book. It was the tail end of her senior year at college, she was already interviewing for jobs, and grades could have been safely ignored. But that didn't stop her.</p>
<p>I had to admit, my curvy, blonde sister looked extra sexy studying. Long blonde hair tied back in a ponytail. Bright blue eyes focused on the pages. Full mouth quirked up as she perused each point. Also, no matter what she did, Lucy still had huge breasts and a great butt. So, there's that.</p>
<p>"What's up?" I asked, stepping into her room. I knew better than to get my hopes up.</p>
<p>A few months of cold had been bad enough. But it was the freeze-out from my siblings that truly had me shivering. It had all started so well that summer, with Lucy and I exploring pillow humping together. Eventually, it escalated (I know, shocker) and we had sex.</p>
<p>We had a pregnancy scare that seemed sure to stop us. But by November we were not only back to it, we'd managed to involve my younger sister, Lindsay, and Lucy's best friend Kara in our debauchery. Once again, we'd seemed unstoppable.</p>
<p>And sure, my oldest sister, Jan, had caught us in the act. But, like a bad porn story on the Internet, she'd actually insisted on joining in! Everything was going gangbusters into Christmas. Lindsay wanted intercourse, Lucy wanted a long-term relationship, and Jan was more than happy to talk dirty while she stroked me off. Sister harem, ftw!</p>
<p>But Santa rewarded our incestuous involvement with something far worse than coal. First, my father had a huge freakout on Christmas Eve. It seemed like it was over nothing, and in truth it wasn't about anything, so much as it was about everything. The fact that he'd lost his job, that the whole family had had to cut back (even on important things like birth control), that we were stuck in this awful, dusty house. Dad lost it on us and things had been tense ever since.</p>
<p>We might have survived that -- after all, we'd started our mutual masturbation matinees as a way to distract ourselves from all the family drama -- but then Lindsay and Lucy caught me doing dirty stuff with Jan.</p>
<p>You see, I'd sort of forgotten to mention that whole setup to my other sisters. And they were both, understandably upset. Lucy and Lindsay weren't mad that I was fooling around with my oldest sister, no, don't be silly. They were perfectly happy to have me do whatever with Jan. They just felt like they deserved to know about it (and they were right).</p>
<p>Still, it seemed like things might be reparable when we got an invitation to a Christmas party at Kara's house. After we caught Kara having a full-on, mfm fuckfest with her two brothers, that's when it really hit home for us.</p>
<p>It wasn't a turn on, as I might have hoped. It didn't make us feel better about what we were doing, as you might have anticipated. Instead, it was a bucket of ice water to the face -- a freezing cold reminder of what we, ourselves, had been doing for all those months.</p>
<p>So, with all those problems piling up, we finally, fully ended things. Lucy and I stopped carpooling to school. Lindsay went back to her friends and finishing high school. Jan's workaholica reinstated itself. My parents, well, they basically kept doing whatever it was they'd been doing. Snarling at us from a distance, mostly.</p>
<p>I'd been certain that things were over before. The pregnancy scare, getting caught by Jan, getting caught with Jan. But this time, this time, I was sure -- we were finished. It was time to move on.</p>
<p>But that didn't stop me from hoping against hope when Lucy called me to her door that early March morning. And it didn't prevent my heart from sinking when my sister told me,</p>
<p>"Some of my friends are going to Florida for Spring Break and I'm going to join them."</p>
<p>"Oh, OK," I said, doing my best to not sound disappointed. "I assume you're doing Daytona?"</p>
<p>"No, Disney, actually."</p>
<p>"Wait, really?" I asked.</p>
<p>"You'd be surprised at how much dirty stuff goes down at the Magic Kingdom," Lucy said with surprising confidence, "Trust me, I've heard some wild stories."</p>
<p>"Well, anyway," I said, not at all convinced, "I hope you have fun."</p>
<p>"Thanks!" Lucy said, "I just thought I should let you know. You know. What about you? Do you have any plans?"</p>
<p>"Nah," I said, "I'm looking forward to the chance to relax."</p>
<p>"I hear that," Lucy said, "Well, I'll talk to you later."</p>
<p>I was halfway through my sister's doorway when I stopped myself.</p>
<p>"Lucy," I said, "I've been meaning to say this for a while. What happened with Jan, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"I don't care about Jan," Lucy said. I raised my eyebrow in a way my oldest sister would have been proud of. "I truly don't."</p>
<p>"Well, I still should have told you about it," I said, "You deserved at least that much."</p>
<p>"Look, Dylan, these past few months have been a lot. Dad's blow up. Catching Kara with her brothers. And yeah, at the time, I was hurt that you kept all that stuff with Jan a secret."</p>
<p>"She caught us -- you, me, and Lindsay -- doing stuff together," I said, "She asked in and I guess I thought... I don't know. I didn't think. That's what it comes down to."</p>
<p>"It's fine, Dylan, truly," my sister said, "Right now, I need to focus on more important stuff. Like graduating college, getting out of this house, getting away from all of this."</p>
<p>"Including me?"</p>
<p>Lucy tried to speak, but it came out as a sob. She shoved my shoulder, pushing me out of her bedroom, and closed the door behind her.</p>
<p>Yes, no doubt. We were really, truly, done this time.</p>
<p>The next morning, with only a few days of classes left before break, I woke up early. Finally resigned to my sisterless fate, I showered and got dressed before the sun was fully up. It felt like a new beginning. It wasn't the one I wanted, but it was what I was stuck with. And, in that way, I was ready for it all to get started.</p>
<p>I was awake early enough that when I came downstairs, I found my mother at the kitchen table eating breakfast. Things with both my parents had been tense since Christmas. I'd assumed, like many of my dad's other tantrums, that this one would blow over in time. He'd regret his rage and we'd all apologize and move on. That hadn't happened. And so, I knew better than to poke the bear.</p>
<p>Dad had already left for the day. It was just Mom. And even though she'd taken his side that night two months ago, I guess I felt like she was safer ground. However, as soon as I entered the kitchen, I was greeted with a scowl.</p>
<p>"Rough day already?" I asked, trying to play innocent.</p>
<p>Mom responded with a grunt. She was staring down at her breakfast like it had done her wrong.</p>
<p>I paused on my way to the coffee machine. This was crazy. I had to live with these people for at least another two years if I wanted to graduate college. It was going to be hard enough without the angry elephant in the room.</p>
<p>"Mom, this has been lingering for far too long," I said, sitting down at the table across from her. "You and I both know that Lucy didn't mean what she said. Not in the way Dad took it anyway."</p>
<p>"Do we now?" Mom said, "So that means your father and I don't need an apology?"</p>
<p>Sheesh, my parents could hold a grudge.</p>
<p>"Lucy's done nothing but apologize since," I said, "Lindsay and Jan, too. I wasn't in the room but, heck, I'm sorry as well. I just want us to be a family again."</p>
<p>"We're always a family," Mom said, "That doesn't change no matter what."</p>
<p>"That's not what I mean," I said, "Look, if it's a money thing, you know I'd quit school and go back to work in a second."</p>
<p>Mom gave me an ugly look. "You don't get it."</p>
<p>"Get what?"</p>
<p>"Life isn't... When you're young, you think you can make a dramatic gesture and suddenly the world will change. It won't. You'll get older and you'll see. One day, life decides to beat you down. And there's nothing you can do about it."</p>
<p>"I don't believe that's true," I said, "I get that Dad lost his job and things have been hard. That money is tight, and we've had a lot of bad luck. Hell, ever since we lost Stevie..."</p>
<p>"Don't say that name!" Mom shrieked. Her eyes shot open, and I swear her pupils were practically red.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. I got that Mom was upset about losing our little brother. I know I still was, deep in the parts of my heart I chose not to explore. But if we weren't going to examine old traumas and at least try to accept them, how could we move forward? How could there be a future if all we could focus on was ignoring the past?</p>
<p>"Sorry," I said, knowing better than to push it. "You get my point. There's a hundred things that could happen. Dad could change careers. Or go back to school, himself, if he wanted. You've got a good job."</p>
<p>Mom snorted.</p>
<p>"Jan's working," I kept plowing on, "Lucy's almost graduated. I'm only a couple years away. We can all help pay for Lindsay. We just have to try."</p>
<p>Mom took a deep breath. The kitchen, the whole house, felt hollow and dull.</p>
<p>"What your sister said that day upset your dad and me," Mom said, "And the fact that none of you came to your father's defense really hurt him. Nothing's changing that. However, too much time has passed, I agree. We need to move on."</p>
<p>I nodded. At least that was a start.</p>
<p>"But no," Mom rested her hand on mine, warmly. Belying the chill of her words. "The world doesn't work like that, sweetie. I'm sorry. Your father tried his hardest for years and they fired him anyway. This is what life is. Some people roll boxcars, but most of us get snake-eyes. And there's nothing you can do to change the dice. You have to learn to live with it."</p>
<p>Driving to school in my old, beat-up Toyota, I couldn't get what Mom said out of my head. There was something that felt so wrong about it. But I couldn't figure out where the flaw in her logic was.</p>
<p>As I weighed her words, it occurred to me that not one thing that had happened in my life the last year -- wonderful or terrible -- had been because of me. Lucy had called me into her room to press. Lucy had invited Lindsay in, as well. Lindsay was the one who spoke to Kara about joining us. And Jan had found us on her own.</p>
<p>Similarly, I hadn't started the fight with my parents, or even truly participated in it. Yes, I hadn't told my sisters about me and Jan, but that had been a passive choice; not really a decision at all. It was easier to say nothing.</p>
<p>I was still doing that. Letting my sisters take their time to forgive me. Watching Lucy go on Spring Break. All of it.</p>
<p>OK, I'd made one active choice. The one time I'd had actual intercourse with Lucy. And I knew exactly how that'd turned out. But even then, it's not like we had a conversation. Or even dealt with things after. I just sort of went with the flow.</p>
<p>And I realized, that's what my father was doing this whole time. He gave up and let the current carry him out to sea. Maybe it was too late for Dad. Once you get out past the breakers, it's nearly impossible to swim back. Especially if you won't let anyone help.</p>
<p>I wasn't out there, yet. I needed to do something before it was too late. I couldn't save my father from the fate he'd unwillingly chosen.</p>
<p>But I could still rescue myself.</p>
<p>Jan sat across from me, looking cross. She had on a dark suit with a light blue blouse --practically a rainbow of chromatic defiance for her. She was wearing dark glasses and her hair was up in its usual tight bun. Jan looked the definition of a successful businesswoman. Or a dominatrix at her day job.</p>
<p>"What are we doing here, Dylan?" Jan asked. Somehow, she managed to keep her lips tight while she talked. It was quite the trick.</p>
<p>I'd called my oldest sister from my car as soon as I'd reached my revelation. This didn't have to be the first step, but it was the best one I could think of. It was a Saturday, but Jan was working anyway because Jan.</p>
<p>We met at an outdoor cafe in the city. A busy place with tiny tables and oversized sandwiches. Bright in the ever-warming sun. We ordered food and talked about nothing while I built up the courage to come out with it.</p>
<p>Midway through the meal, Jan got a work call. She answered it with a practiced ease. She didn't seem harried, but she clearly expressed her frustration at being interrupted. She wasn't rough or rude, but I could tell from my side of the table that my sister was solving the problem with efficiency and grace. It was kind of amazing to watch. I still didn't understand what my oldest sister did for a living, but I could tell she was damn good at it.</p>
<p>I'd always thought of Jan as tough, but I realized that made her capable and skilled, too. I was proud of her.</p>
<p>Finally, though, as our plates were cleared, Jan ran out of patience and asked her question. I'd known what I was going to do when I asked to meet. But I'd forgotten how intimidating Jan could be, just by being herself. When she snapped at me, the sudden pressure squeezed out my words in a way I wasn't expecting.</p>
<p>"Are you happy, Jan?"</p>
<p>My sister eyed me, oddly. Like she was considering how much to say. As if I didn't already know the answer. Finally, my sister made up her mind.</p>
<p>"Not particularly," she said.</p>
<p>"That's what I figured," I said, "I don't think any of us are, really."</p>
<p>"No, I suppose not," Jan said.</p>
<p>"What would make you happy?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know, I haven't thought about it, being honest," Jan said.</p>
<p>I gave my sister an evaluating look. But she just shrugged.</p>
<p>"Maybe family," Jan said, "But maybe not, like, our family. I'm not mad at you, Dylan. Or the Ells. I just mean, not the family thing we have now. Or what it was like before. We always forget that things weren't that great before, either."</p>
<p>"How much money do you make?" I asked.</p>
<p>Jan's eyes widened. She was getting ready to stab me from across the table. The knife was already in her hand. I knew I was going about this the wrong way; but it was the only direction I'd been able to come up with.</p>
<p>"Sorry, that's not how I meant that to come out," I said, "That was rude. But, honestly. Actually. Yes, that's my question. What are you earning these days?"</p>
<p>"That's none of your business, Dylan," Jan said, raising her eyebrow in her signature way. "I make enough."</p>
<p>"What's enough?" I asked, "I don't mean a number. Not exactly. See, the thing is, Lucy's about to graduate. And I've been looking into things. It won't change much if I start going to classes at night. Adds another six months, maybe. But that's not bad at all."</p>
<p>"Are you asking what I think you are?" Jan's face looked surprisingly soft. A bit of a smile started to curl at the corner of her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Yeah," I said, "Yes. I think I am."</p>
<p>I met Lindsay at her studio, my duffle bag swung over my shoulder. Even though we'd agreed to meet that afternoon, my youngest sister still looked surprised to see me. She had on her usual yoga pants with a tight, yellow tank top that bared her taut tummy and toned shoulders. Lindsay's epically long, light brown hair was pulled back in a braid that trailed down her spine.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you're here," Lindsay said. She was grinning like crazy.</p>
<p>About twenty other people came in after me. The studio was small, and the floor was lined with mats. The far wall was a full mirror, reflecting my little sister back at the class. The place smelled of whatever incense Lindsay was pumping into the room and the faint odor of sweat. Light guitar music played in the background. I stood in the middle of the group so as not to completely embarrass myself. I figured I'd do OK. After all, we were only stretching. How hard could that be?</p>
<p>Forty minutes later I had my answer. I was ready to die. My sister made it all look so easy. It was more than the fluidity of her body, the lithe confidence of her muscles. Lindsay had a look on her face that spread contented bliss around the room.</p>
<p>She was good at this. There were people more than twice her age in that class and I got the sense that if Lindsay announced that our next position was 'jump off the bridge' the whole group would follow her there. She just had 'it,' whatever that was.</p>
<p>I'd always thought of my sister as a bit flighty, but I realized that made her imaginative and empathetic, as well. I was proud of her.</p>
<p>After the class, my body breaking in ways I didn't realize it could, I found my sister casually toweling herself off at the front of the studio. The mirror made it seem like there were multiples of her, all moving in the same way.</p>
<p>"That was. Quite. The workout," I said. Even talking was too much for me.</p>
<p>Lindsay grinned at me, broadly. "I thought you did pretty good for a first timer."</p>
<p>"Uh huh," I said, getting ready to die on the floor. "You do this. Every day?"</p>
<p>"No, I go to high school, remember," Lindsay said, "But this is nice on the weekends. And it's good to get the extra cash."</p>
<p>"Really?" I asked, "How much money do you make, exactly?"</p>
<p>Lindsay quirked her eyebrow at me, in a remarkable imitation of our oldest sister.</p>
<p>That night, as soon as I got home, I marched down the hallway and pounded on Lucy's door. Finally, she opened it, looking disheveled. Her blonde hair was loose, running in rivulets over her shoulders. Her bright blue eyes were covered with confusion.</p>
<p>"Don't go," I said. My body was still hurting from Lindsay's workout. Just climbing our steps had almost been the end of me.</p>
<p>"What?" Lucy asked, "Dylan what are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Disney," I said, "Don't do it. Stay home for Spring Break."</p>
<p>"What? Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I want you to," I said.</p>
<p>Lucy evaluated me in the hallway for a moment. Like I was trying to sell her on Scientology. We'd been through so much together. But that was the key word. Together. I had strong feelings for Jan and Lindsay, sure. They were my sisters and I cared about them more than I could say. But Lucy was different. And in the end, I knew better than to try to trick her. I had to come out and say it. She deserved that much, after all that she'd done.</p>
<p>I'd always thought of my sister as my best friend. It was time that I started treating her that way. Make her proud of me.</p>
<p>"OK," Lucy said, carefully. Like any syllable might trip up a falling spike or a rolling boulder. "I'll call my friends and tell them I'm out."</p>
<p>I thanked Lucy, then went back to my room to die. Man, taking agency in my own life was way more painful than I'd expected.</p>
<p>Our first day of Spring Break, the sun shone through my windows like it, too, was celebrating. I had a whole week to make things right. Lucy and Lindsay would both be home, but my parents would not. And there were always evenings with Jan.</p>
<p>I got into sweatpants and a t-shirt, then headed downstairs. I found Lucy and Lindsay both sitting at the table, eating breakfast and staring at their respective screens. Before they could even say hello, I gave them the signature chin jut.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>"Seriously?" Lucy asked. I could hear the skepticism in her voice. "That's your plan?"</p>
<p>I shrugged. Excellent dialectic, I know. But my younger sister had my back.</p>
<p>"Oh, come on," Lindsay said, popping out of her chair. "Don't tell me you couldn't go for one right now."</p>
<p>"Fine," Lucy said. She stood up, scraping her chair loudly on the hardwood. "I can't believe I'm missing Mickey for this."</p>
<p>The girls grabbed some pillows and we all flopped onto the floor of the living room. It wasn't anything special. We didn't talk to each other or even acknowledge what we were sharing. The three of us wriggled our genitals into the ground before reaching the inevitable peak. It was almost clinical.</p>
<p>When she was done, Lindsay leapt to her feet. "Whew! I needed that. Thanks, Dylan!" She skipped up the stairs, then stopped and turned back to me.</p>
<p>I was slowly standing up, doing my best to ignore the wet spot in my sweats.</p>
<p>"Hey," Lindsay said, "Cause it's break, I'm doing a class this afternoon. You know, if you want to join."</p>
<p>"I'd love to," I said, giving her a little wave as she bounded up the stairs.</p>
<p>"You do yoga now?" Lucy asked, looking up at me from the floor. Don't think I missed how her massive chest jutted alluringly under her sweater.</p>
<p>"I support my sister," I said.</p>
<p>"I see," Lucy said. She brushed off her pants. "And if you had a sister who maybe wanted to spend some time taking down Ganon, you'd be willing to assist with that, as well?"</p>
<p>"Lead the way, my Link," I said, bowing graciously.</p>
<p>I lay in bed that night, staring up at the ceiling. My muscles ached from working out that afternoon with Lindsay. My eyes thrummed tired from staring at the screen all morning with Lucy. My body, though, was ready to take the next step with yet another sister.</p>
<p>I waited for my moment. Till the sounds of the house quieted down. And the lights went low. Like a cat hunting its prey, I stayed nearly still till I knew the time was right. Finally, I picked up my phone and typed in that all important message.</p>
<p>To Jan: Come</p>
<p>No response. I knew she was in her room. Was probably reading and wouldn't be looking at her phone. Ten minutes passed with nothing. I tried again.</p>
<p>Come</p>
<p>Come!</p>
<p>COME!</p>
<p>Jan finally wrote back. "?"</p>
<p>I responded. "Cum?"</p>
<p>I heard a door shut in the distance. Then footsteps padding in the hallway. Finally, a knock on my door.</p>
<p>Abruptly, I worried that I'd made a misstep. Jan's movements didn't sound like those of someone who was super excited to be heading over to my bedroom. I braced myself as my door swung open, hoping I hadn't upset her too badly.</p>
<p>My smoke show of a sister stepped in front of the bed. Her black hair up in a bun. She had on that black lingerie -- the silky, button-down top and shorts. They revealed nothing. But Jan was so damn sexy it didn't matter.</p>
<p>"I thought we weren't doing this anymore," Jan said. She eyed me like I might be hiding a gun behind my back. My actual weapon was already standing at the ready in my sweatpants.</p>
<p>"Who told you that?" I asked, dismissively, then gestured for Jan to join me.</p>
<p>My oldest sister eyed the walls, warily. I patted the side of my bed as I stripped from the waist down.</p>
<p>"Did you really invite me in here just to..." Jan's face formed a sneer.</p>
<p>"Duh."</p>
<p>There was a pause. A moment where we both stepped off the precipice and everything I'd planned hung in the balance.</p>
<p>"Such a naughty little brother," Jan said, now smirking instead. She took off her shorts, spreading her legs as she lay back next to me.</p>
<p>"You should have brought your toy," I told her.</p>
<p>Jan looked at me, then raised an eyebrow. "I have a better idea," she said. Her blue eyes alight.</p>
<p>Jan got up and headed towards the foot of my bed. At first, I have to admit, I was confused. Then I noticed that Jan was making her way over to one of the corners. My frame had little wooden bedposts, each about waist high from the floor and squarish. I heard Jan let out a little gasp. I didn't need to see to realize what she was doing.</p>
<p>I didn't need to see, but damn sure wanted to (not that the view of Jan's undulating ass was all that bad, either). I leapt off the bed and hurried over to the far corner so I could see what my sister was up to.</p>
<p>As I'd surmised, Jan was on her knees on my mattress, her sex pressed against the small bedpost. It was smaller than a standard dick, thinner and shorter (and squarer), but I had to admit the thing was sort of penis-like. Especially when pressed into my sister's furry furrow.</p>
<p>I slid my desk chair over, cock in my hand. Like she didn't see me at all, Jan rubbed up and down on her new, wooden friend. Humping it against her clit. My oldest sister pulled off her shirt, mid thrust, squeezing both her breasts and groaning. It was like she was giving me a show. Yet at the same time so lost in her world of pleasure she hardly noticed me.</p>
<p>Jan pumped against the frame. She pinched her nipples purple. The post was hard and sharpish on the edges. I had to imagine there was a good amount of pain in what she was doing. But some part of me realized that was the point. Jan liked to punish herself. That was part of the pleasure of it.</p>
<p>"You're such a bad big sister," I said, smiling up at her.</p>
<p>I lazily stroked at my dick, enjoying the performance. This was almost as good as when she brought out her lilac dildo. In some ways it was better. Working herself like this took Jan's entire body. Fuck me, this was beautiful.</p>
<p>"You want it," Jan said, "Naughty brother. Wish it was you. Fucking me. Don't you?"</p>
<p>I could only nod my head in agreement. She knew damn well I did.</p>
<p>"Naughty boy," she said, "You can't put your -- uhn -- cock in your sister."</p>
<p>"You're the one that wants it so bad," I said, "Feel my dick inside you. Pumping you full."</p>
<p>"Oh. OH! Such a... Bad brother. Making sissy feel GOOD!"</p>
<p>Jan arched her back. She squeezed her left nipple so hard I swore she was about to pull it right off. Her entire body went taut. Like she was posing for an old-timey picture and had to stay in place for hours on end. I could see back on the bed, her toes were literally curling.</p>
<p>It was all I could take. Being honest, I'd barely even worked myself. But it didn't matter. My dick spurted out, spattering my oldest sister with my seed.</p>
<p>"Oh YES!" she cried out again as my first ejaculation splashed her. A stripe of white splooge that painted her from shoulder to waist. The next one hit her tit. The third... I was too far gone. I couldn't see anything except wave after wave of unbridled ecstasy as I unloaded on my sister.</p>
<p>Jan fell back to the bed, panting. The bedpost, abandoned, dripped girl cum down onto my sheets. She hugged my pillow, burying her nose in my scent.</p>
<p>My cock hung limply, spitting the last of my spend into my palm. I tumbled out of the chair and climbed into bed, spooning against my naked sister. She shifted, pressing herself as close as possible. Jan's body, for all her angles, was surprisingly soft. I couldn't help myself -- I untied my oldest sister's inky hair and ran my hand through it. Cool and silky, like her lingerie from before.</p>
<p>"That was fun," Jan said.</p>
<p>"It was."</p>
<p>"Why did we stop doing that again?" Jan asked.</p>
<p>"I honestly don't know," I said.</p>
<p>"Lindsay and Lucy...?"</p>
<p>"They're fine," I said, "They already know. I told them."</p>
<p>"OK," Jan said. She was doing the sleepy mumbling thing. I felt her body go limp. She was going to pass out here in my room, naked, and I had no intention of stopping her. Anyone could find us together. More importantly, I didn't care.</p>
<p>Jan's head popped up, like she'd been having one of those falling dreams. "Dylan?"</p>
<p>"I'm here," I said.</p>
<p>"I lied before," she said.</p>
<p>"I'm actually a good brother?"</p>
<p>"The best," Jan said. That seemed to be it for a moment. "No, I mean before before. Like way before. In December. When I told you I don't do angry or jealous or sad.</p>
<p>"I know, it's OK."</p>
<p>"I just felt so alone. Ignored," Jan said, "I was working like a dog every day, no boyfriend or nothing, and my own siblings were hanging around and... I got mad."</p>
<p>"I get it, Jan, I really do. We should have said something sooner."</p>
<p>"'Hey sis, so you know, we're all fucking?'" Jan laughed. "No, I get it. I just. I know you all think I'm a robot or something. I have feelings, too."</p>
<p>"Of course you do," I said.</p>
<p>"I'm terrible," Jan said.</p>
<p>"You're amazing."</p>
<p>"This is why I'm alone," Jan said. She sounded close to sobbing. "It's why Jake left me."</p>
<p>Jake was the fiance from before. The dude she'd been engaged to, then mysteriously split off with right before moving back home.</p>
<p>"He was like, perfect," Jan said, "His hair, his body. Good family. Whole package. Then I got the call about Dad losing his job and you all having to come back from school. I guess you were on my mind."</p>
<p>I honestly couldn't tell where this was leading. I was almost certain she was awake, but her words had the ramble of someone talking in their sleep.</p>
<p>"After the call, Jake and I. We did, you know. We made love. And I said it. I don't know why I did, but the words came out."</p>
<p>"The whole 'naughty' thing?" I asked.</p>
<p>"The whole naughty brother thing," Jan replied.</p>
<p>"Oh fuck," I said.</p>
<p>"Exactly," Jan said, "Jake froze. He couldn't even look me in the eye. He asked me for his ring back and everything. It was bad."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Jan," I said, "I didn't know you, like, had those feelings."</p>
<p>"Neither did I," Jan said. She really did sob then. "I guess it was some weird subconscious thing. At the time, I mean. It was just a fantasy. I didn't actually want... Well, you know."</p>
<p>"Honestly Jan, it seems like he should have been a little more understanding. Like, if you're going to share your lives together, he ought to be able to handle a little kink. Right?"</p>
<p>"It was too much. I freaked him out. I freaked me out. So I came home. Not for this." Jan gestured at our naked bodies. "But because I was so broken. I didn't know what else to do."</p>
<p>"Do Mom and Dad...?"</p>
<p>"Are you kidding?!"</p>
<p>"Right," I said, "Of course not."</p>
<p>"And then I saw you and Lucy," Jan said, "I told myself it was nothing. A trick of my mind. But it kept happening. Catching you. And it made me so angry. And now here we are."</p>
<p>"You're punishing yourself," I said.</p>
<p>"Moving back home?" Jan said, "Yes. For sure. But this? I don't know what this is. It doesn't feel like punishment."</p>
<p>I hugged my oldest sister tighter. Kissed the back of her neck. I felt my dick, bless him, start to stiffen against her ass. But I knew this wasn't the time, so I pulled my groin back.</p>
<p>Jan sighed. She got out of bed. Her face was stained with tears.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go back to my room now," Jan said, "Thanks. For everything."</p>
<p>"Everything?" I asked, looking pointedly at my pointing penis.</p>
<p>"Oh heck yes," Jan said.</p>
<p>She kissed my forehead before slipping into the hallway.</p>
<p>"I had sex with Lucy," I said.</p>
<p>Lindsay looked up at me, surprised. We were both sitting at the kitchen table, eating lunch. My youngest sister was in her usual uniform of a bright pink, tummy-revealing tank top and tight yoga pants.</p>
<p>"Like, right now?" Lindsay asked. She looked so cute when she was confused. "Seriously?!"</p>
<p>"No, of course not," I said, "I've been home with you all day."</p>
<p>"OK good," Lindsay said, "I don't mind you doing it. I just want to make sure I'm there to see it."</p>
<p>I did not know how to respond to that. I took a deep breath and reset.</p>
<p>"No, what I meant was, Lucy and I had sex before. Like, before before. Back during the summer."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Lindsay said, "That's nice. Was it good? Ooo, was it bad? Is that why you stopped doing it? Are you, like, terrible in bed?"</p>
<p>"No! The sex was good. Really good. Like really really awesome good."</p>
<p>"I don't get why you're telling me any of this," Lindsay said, taking a bite of her yogurt.</p>
<p>"I'm trying to get there," I said.</p>
<p>"Well, go faster. We have class in an hour, and I need to get there early to set up."</p>
<p>"Lucy and I had sex back in the summer, and we made a mistake," I said, "I made a mistake."</p>
<p>I waited for my younger sister to interrupt, but she just stared back at me, intently. Her spoon rested on the edge of her bowl.</p>
<p>"We didn't use protection and... Well, you know."</p>
<p>"Lucy got pregnant!?"</p>
<p>"No, thank God."</p>
<p>"OK," Lindsay said, she went back to her breakfast. "And so your point is?"</p>
<p>"You asked me before why things were weird between Lucy and me," I said, "I thought you deserved to know. Especially because of what you've been saying. About us."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry about that," Lindsay said, "I know you think I'm some kind of space cadet, but I know what I'm doing. I won't get pregnant."</p>
<p>"OK," I said, "Good. But you still want to...?"</p>
<p>"Oh, for sure," Lindsay said, as casually as she was talking about a trip to the mall to buy underwear. "Have you talked to Lucy about this?"</p>
<p>"That I almost got her pregnant?" I asked, "Pretty sure she knows."</p>
<p>"No, I mean talked to her," Lindsay said, "Like for real."</p>
<p>I thought back. We'd definitely discussed things a few times. But had I truly talked it all out with my older sister in the way that Lindsay was asking?</p>
<p>"We need to head out," Lindsay said. My younger sister was flighty about everything, but not class. There, she was like some kind of mechanical engineer. Five minutes early was still ten minutes too late. "But thank you for telling me."</p>
<p>"Like I said, I thought you should know." I took her bowl from her and went to wash it in the sink.</p>
<p>"You've been giving me a lot of attention lately," Lindsay said, "Don't think I haven't noticed."</p>
<p>"Is that OK?" I asked from the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Yes, it very much is," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>"You told her?" Lucy asked when I got in the car.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon. Yoga was over and Lindsay was at home doing Lindsay-things (Vaping, napping, communicating with her inner-goddess. Something like that). My body ached like crazy from the class. If anything, I felt like the workouts were getting harder. Like my younger sister was intentionally upping the degree of difficulty every time I showed up.</p>
<p>"And?" Lucy pressed me. I always preferred her other form of pressing, personally. "Does she still want to do it?"</p>
<p>"More than ever," I said, "She even asked if she could do my 'moon chart' beforehand. Whatever that means."</p>
<p>"I don't think that has anything to do with your butt," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Thank God for that," I said.</p>
<p>"It's too bad," Lucy said, "You have a nice butt."</p>
<p>She put her car into gear and drove off. We headed into town, her car rattling and rumbling as we went. The sun was low on the horizon, but still brighter at 5pm than it had been in months. I could see little green buds on some of the trees. The world was finally breaking out of its deep freeze.</p>
<p>"And Jan?" Lucy asked, "How are things with her?"</p>
<p>"Pretty good," I said, "We had a nice talk the other night. I think she's opening up for me, finally."</p>
<p>"In more ways than one?" Lucy asked, giving me an oversized wink. As hot as it was when she did it, I wished she'd pay more attention to the road.</p>
<p>"Seriously, Jan's really coming around."</p>
<p>"You're doing this on purpose," Lucy said, "I know you are."</p>
<p>"I mean, I thought she'd make it hard for me..."</p>
<p>"Enough," Lucy said, grabbing my hand while swerving to miss a lamppost, "Enough schtick."</p>
<p>"Seriously, I don't get how you're so cool about all this," I said, "Lindsay and Jan and all of it."</p>
<p>Lucy shrugged. "I don't know," she said, "We're family."</p>
<p>We pulled up to the strip mall and Lucy parked. Her old car sighed, like it was relieved it had survived the trip. I wasn't far off. My older sister was amazing at most things, but driving wasn't one of them.</p>
<p>"I still can't believe I let you talk me into this," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"I think it's important," I said, "You told me you wanted more, and this is where that starts."</p>
<p>"Indoor, glow-in-the-dark, sci-fi, mutant mini-golf," Lucy said, reading the sign above us. "You're such a romantic."</p>
<p>"Come on," I said, jumping out of the car. I hurried over to open Lucy's door for her. "I've got a two-for-one coupon for McDonald's for after, but it's only good if we get there before 4pm."</p>
<p>To my delight, my beautiful blonde sister laughed.</p>
<p>Cum.</p>
<p>I typed the word to Jan. Our chat stream looked like the script for someone's one-word challenge audio porn recording.</p>
<p>Come</p>
<p>Come</p>
<p>COME!</p>
<p>Cum?</p>
<p>Cum</p>
<p>CUM!</p>
<p>Cum cum cum</p>
<p>Cummity cum cummity</p>
<p>Cummy, cummy, two-by-four get your hot ass in my door</p>
<p>(OK, I may have made that last one up)</p>
<p>I heard the door slam and the sound of footsteps. It sounded like my usually aloof, older sister was racing down the hallway. So much for discretion.</p>
<p>She opened the door wearing something new: a black, silky kimono dappled with bright red flowers. It hung to barely below her sex and was open down to her navel in the middle. She was grinning wildly, until she noticed I wasn't alone.</p>
<p>"Oh," Jan said.</p>
<p>My oldest sister couldn't hide her disappointment as she saw me, Lindsay, and Lucy all sitting in my bedroom, fully clothed and playing cards on the floor. Lucy was wearing a sweater and jeans. Lindsay had on a t-shirt and her yoga pants. I was just chilling in my sweats and a tee. All very casual, normal sibling stuff. Sad, isn't it?</p>
<p>"Family game night?" Jan asked. She couldn't keep the disdain out of her voice. But to her credit, she was at least trying.</p>
<p>"Something like that," Lucy said, cheerfully. She patted the open space next to her on the floor.</p>
<p>Jan made another 'ate a sour grape' face, but she flopped down between Lindsay and me, folding her legs in a way that somehow managed to keep her pussy from being exposed in that kimono. She let out a long sigh.</p>
<p>Lindsay reached over to feel the material of her oldest sister's outfit. "Ooo, silky."</p>
<p>"I can't help but feel like I need to change," Jan said, eyeing the rest of our outfits.</p>
<p>"Personally, I love you just the way you are," I said.</p>
<p>Jan responded by sticking her tongue out at me.</p>
<p>"Don't worry," Lucy said, smiling so wide it threatened to swallow her face. "We aren't going to stay this way for long."</p>
<p>Lindsay gathered all the cards from the floor and made a tidy deck. Then she started shuffling the cards with the deft, expert demeanor of a seasoned dealer at the casino. Her dexterous fingers danced over the cards.</p>
<p>"You all aren't going to start humping the floor, are you?" Jan asked.</p>
<p>"Don't be lewd," Lindsay said, primly. She handed each of us a card. "Show down."</p>
<p>Lucy gave me a searching look. I shrugged back at my older sister. I didn't know what the skinny brunette was up to, either. We all turned over our cards. I was highest with a King. Lucy was lowest with a five.</p>
<p>Lindsay gestured at Lucy, making her meaning clear. My older sister grinned. She stood up and took off her sweater, revealing a tight, baby blue t-shirt. It clung to her massive chest in a way that was almost better than her being topless.</p>
<p>"This is either the worst game ever or the best," Jan said, looking at her sister, warily.</p>
<p>"Where are Mom and Dad?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Out," Lucy said, "Or downstairs watching TV. Or in their bedroom. I honestly don't give a fuck." The other girls nodded their agreement. I guess that question was answered.</p>
<p>Cards went around the room and clothes started flying off. It became immediately obvious that this wasn't a game at all, just Lindsay finding excuses for all of us to get mostly naked. Sometimes high card won, sometimes low did. Diamonds beat spades but only if a girl was holding the card? And one time Lucy had to take off her bra because, in Lindsay's words, 'the planets make it so.'</p>
<p>It was utter nonsense but who cared as I was quickly surrounded by beautiful, bare sister-flesh. Finally, the girls were all down to their panties and me to my boxers. I couldn't help but revel in the differences between Lucy's massive, swelling breasts, Jan's full, pointed tits, and Lindsay's cute, perky boobs. Lindsay's tiny, lithe body, Jan's sharp, lanky build, and Lucy's plunging curves.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>For their parts, the girls kept glancing at the growing tent beneath my boxers, like they were anxiously waiting for the real game to begin. Lord knows, I felt hard enough to start smacking baseballs. And I was confident I was about to hit at least a double, if not touch all the bases.</p>
<p>I assumed the next round would end with us removing our remaining piece of clothing, but instead, Lindsay declared that it was time for a new game. She drew two cards and held them up: a six of spades and a ten of hearts. She gestured to me and Lucy.</p>
<p>"Kiss," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>I looked over at my curvy, blonde sister. We'd touched each other in almost every way. But, somehow, this felt particularly intimate. It meant more than getting each other off. That was fun but oddly transactional. This was an expression of true affection for no other purpose. It was incest on a whole new level.</p>
<p>Lucy seemed to feel it too. She eyed our sister.</p>
<p>"The cards say it has to happen," Lindsay said with a shrug.</p>
<p>"You're making this up as you go along," Lucy said.</p>
<p>Lindsay gave all of us a wolfish smirk. "If that's what you want to believe."</p>
<p>"Fine," Lucy said.</p>
<p>She leaned across the circle, epic breasts dangling, and gave me a quick smack on the lips. Already aroused, I felt myself warm from my toes to my hair. Lucy sat back, smiling.</p>
<p>Lindsay drew two more cards out of the deck. To be honest, I don't remember what they were. Did it matter, truly?</p>
<p>"Kiss," Lindsay said, pointing at myself and Jan.</p>
<p>My oldest sister didn't look happy about it, but she leaned over and gave me a peck on the lips.</p>
<p>"This better be going somewhere, shrimp," Jan said to Lindsay.</p>
<p>"Just relax, crab," Lindsay replied.</p>
<p>Two more cards. This time Lindsay pointed to herself and me. When I leaned over to kiss her, she grabbed the back of my head. It was less of a kiss and more of her sucking the breath out of me. Wet, smacking passionate.</p>
<p>"Wow," Lucy said as we finally broke.</p>
<p>"See, that's a kiss," Lindsay said. Clearly our youngest, least experienced sister had decided she needed to teach all of us a lesson.</p>
<p>"I see that," Jan said. She layered the words with distaste, but the expression on her face was of far more interest.</p>
<p>"Now," Lindsay said, pointing back at Lucy and me. "KISS."</p>
<p>My older sister, still grinning silly from our last little peck, crawled over and pressed her lips to mine. We shared a gasp as we fully connected. I couldn't help myself. I reached for Lucy's ample boob and hefted it in my hand.</p>
<p>My sister must have been feeling similarly, because she reached into my boxers and fished out my cock. She began slowly stroking it. Our tongues entwined. Finally, we came apart, gasping for air. I don't think we really intended to stop, but then our little sister cleared her throat.</p>
<p>"The cards didn't say to do that," Lindsay said, looking pointedly at where Lucy's hand was still clutching my cock. At my fingers on her tits.</p>
<p>"Fuck your cards," Lucy said, she leaned forward and gave me another kiss.</p>
<p>"Oh no," Lindsay said, "That's the whole point. The cards fuck you."</p>
<p>"Can we please go back to the game," Jan said. She was rubbing her legs together in a most telling way.</p>
<p>"Yes," Lindsay said, pulling out two more cards. She didn't even bother showing us. She just looked and cooed.</p>
<p>"Kiss," she said, gesturing at Jan and me.</p>
<p>My oldest sister looked nervous for a moment. If Lucy and I were awkward at first, Jan and I were far worse. We'd barely touched each other so far.</p>
<p>"No," Lindsay said. She made her meaning clear. My cock was sticking, bare, out of my boxers and Lindsay pointed right at it. "Kiss."</p>
<p>Jan's eyes threatened to pop out of her head. I had the sense this was the break point. Would she do it? If she took this step, actual oral with her younger brother, then we truly would be on our way to something spectacular. And if she didn't, this whole thing was going to blow up in our faces.</p>
<p>But, as I awaited my fate, I remembered my promise to myself. I was letting things happen again. After all, Lindsay was steering all of this. And I was sitting back allowing Jan to make her choice. That wouldn't do. Not at all.</p>
<p>I put my hand on the side of Jan's head. Let my fingers run through her oil-dark hair. I realized she had it down again. It was so silky and cool to the touch. I thumbed her cheek. Met those bright blue eyes with mine.</p>
<p>"Come on sis," I said, "Suck my cock."</p>
<p>Gently, I steered Jan down till her lips touched my dick. And with an eager purr, my oldest sister swallowed my member.</p>
<p>"Oh fuck," I said, as I was surrounded by the warm wet of her mouth. Damn she felt so good. Her tongue slurping and licking all around my shaft.</p>
<p>"Such a naughty sister," Lucy said, "Blowing your baby brother like that."</p>
<p>Jan squeaked. The top of her chest and her cheeks went pink.</p>
<p>"Only a nasty slut would suck off her sibling," Lindsay said, "A needy, broken thing."</p>
<p>"That's your little brother," Lucy said, "You can't make him feel like that."</p>
<p>"Oh God," Jan popped her head off my dick. Her eyes rolled back in her head.</p>
<p>"Did you just cum from that you sister slut?" Lindsay asked.</p>
<p>Jan's hand shot up and she squeezed her nipple. Her whole body seemed to cinch. Her breath sucked in raw. "Fuh... fuck me."</p>
<p>Our oldest sister fell on the floor, panting.</p>
<p>"Well, that was fun," Lucy said, "Didn't even need to touch you for that."</p>
<p>"Yuh," Jan said, still gasping for air. "Uh huh."</p>
<p>Lindsay sat to the side, looking pouty. "I want to cum too," she whined.</p>
<p>"So, rub yourself off, you little goof," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"I want Dylan to do it," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>"Do you want to do it?" Lucy asked, "Or do it?"</p>
<p>"Ooooh, I want to see that," Jan said. Apparently, she was conscious enough to get our sister's meaning.</p>
<p>Lindsay froze, thinking about it. She grabbed her phone from the side and tapped a few buttons. "Not yet," she said, frowning slightly, "The celestials are not fully aligned."</p>
<p>"She means she might be ovulating," Lucy said.</p>
<p>Lindsay glared at her older sister.</p>
<p>"Bad little sister," Jan said. She was mumbling, like off in her own little dream world. "Giving her brother a little baby."</p>
<p>"Jeez, we broke her brain," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"I know, right?" Lindsay said, "Wait till Dylan fucks her."</p>
<p>"Ohhhhhh fuck yeah," Jan murmured.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I wasn't thrilled that my sisters were already making decisions about what I was going to be doing with my dick. On the other, I mean, OK I was absolutely ecstatic.</p>
<p>"Dylan can still get me off though," Lindsay said, pulling us back to the pussy at hand.</p>
<p>"Sure thing," I said, "Fingers?" I asked, waggling my digits. "Or tongue."</p>
<p>"Tongue please!" Lindsay practically shouted it. She ripped off her panties, shoved her supple legs apart and flopped back on her elbows.</p>
<p>I buried myself in my little sister's wanting snatch. Her taste was almost floral. Full and womanly. I lapped at her juices before settling into her most intimate place. Pressing with my tongue while I pushed with my fingers.</p>
<p>Behind me, I felt something wonderful engulf my cock and knew it was Lucy, sucking me off. It was different than what Jan had done to me before, more loving, but no less lovely. Difficult too, as I was pulled between the two poles of giving and receiving.</p>
<p>None of us were going to last long like this. Lindsay wrapped her legs around my neck. She squeaked, then giggled as her orgasm overtook her. Her pleasure gave me the last little push I needed. My cock swelled in Lucy's mouth, and I peaked, shooting my warmth onto her tongue. Behind me, I heard my older sister grunt as I emptied, her own finger-supplied orgasm mixing with those of her siblings.</p>
<p>All four of us collapsed on the floor, spent. Covered in each other's juices and not even caring. Each of my sisters kissed me in turn. We drifted off to sleep there, entangled.</p>
<p>Like it was nothing at all.</p>
<p>"It's time," Lindsay said, a few days later. "I can feel it."</p>
<p>We'd stopped pretending at propriety. With a week off and nothing to do except each other, we'd been doing exactly that. Jan had even taken the rest of the week off from work (apparently, she had a hoard of PTO, saved up from working herself to death for the last few years). Lindsay's game may have been ridiculous, but it accomplished what it was supposed to -- we were off to the races.</p>
<p>The four of us rubbed, licked, and sucked every chance we got. Lucy and Lindsay got to see Jan's dildo in all of its violet glory. They all tried humping my bedpost. Jan even did the press thing once -- though she stopped after about a minute, said it was dumb, and got her toy instead.</p>
<p>More importantly, though, we all did it together. Moreover, our connections felt casual, like we were binging a show on Netflix or taking on a baking project. As if this was something totally normal for families to do together. Most importantly, though, we didn't do the other thing. You know, the big finale.</p>
<p>We talked about it a lot. Usually when we were covering each other with our cums. But actual penetration, good ol' d-in-p, never came to pass. Which was fine, really. I was beginning to become comfortable with the fact that it was something my sisters wanted to talk about, rather than do.</p>
<p>Especially with the whole 'no birth control' thing, that was probably a good idea. Actually, when I thought about it that way, our insistence on keeping things mostly masturbatory was probably for the best.</p>
<p>Then, one afternoon, I was in the kitchen making dinner when Lindsay scampered over to me, grabbed my hand, and said the magic words.</p>
<p>"It's time."</p>
<p>"Now?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Now now," Lindsay said. I looked around the house. Our parents were both working. Jan and Lucy, oddly, were nowhere to be seen. It was just me and my little sister in the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Can I at least finish boiling the pasta?" I asked, "I don't want to ruin dinner."</p>
<p>Lindsay actually looked at her watch. "Two minutes," she said. Then she bolted off, long brown hair flowing behind her like a mane.</p>
<p>I looked at the boiling pot of water. Would two minutes even be enough to... Oh who was I kidding?</p>
<p>"Fuck it," I said to no one in particular, and switched off the burner.</p>
<p>I hurried back to my little sister's bedroom.</p>
<p>I quickly discovered where Lucy and Jan were -- they were waiting for me in Lindsay's room. My little sister lay back on the bed, fully clothed. Our older sisters stood on either side of her. There was something almost religious about the scene.</p>
<p>Part of that came from Lindsay's own adornments. She'd lit candles on either side of the bed and covered the sheets in pink and purple petals. There was a strong scent of lavender in the air, coming from a nearby puffing purifier. Light dulcimer music played. Were we about to have horrible, dirty incest here or raise the dead? I almost laughed, trying to figure out which would be the less transgressive against the laws of nature.</p>
<p>"Took you long enough," Jan said as I entered the bedroom. I gave my oldest sister a glare.</p>
<p>"We, um..." Lucy started, then fumbled. There was something adorable about her discomfort. She was usually so easy and confident about this kind of stuff. "That is."</p>
<p>"I asked my sisters to be here to assist in the ritual," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>Ritual.</p>
<p>"You have to admit, it sounds better than incest orgy," Jan said with a wry smile.</p>
<p>Orgy!?</p>
<p>"Just you and me," Lindsay said, "I promise. We have to align, in body and mind. Our connection. I feel it pulling at me."</p>
<p>"She means she's horny as fuck," Jan said. Apparently, she'd taken on the role of translator for the day's event.</p>
<p>"OK, I think we've got this," I said, looking my sisters off. This was weird enough as is without having a sold-out crowd.</p>
<p>"No," Lindsay said quickly. "I want them to stay. For the, um, connection. It'll help strengthen the bond."</p>
<p>I didn't need my oldest sister to decipher that one. Lindsay wanted to be seen as in control, but she was nervous about this. Having Lucy and Jan there, as odd as it might have seemed, was helping her stay comfortable. I wasn't going to argue with her about that.</p>
<p>"No problem," I said.</p>
<p>My sister nodded. She was still fully clothed, lying back on the bed with her arms and legs so stiff she might have been chained there. I sat on the bed, gingerly, and stroked my baby sister's long brown hair. She cooed.</p>
<p>"I know how important this is to you," I said.</p>
<p>"To us," Lindsay corrected me. "Everything we've planned. None of it can happen unless we do this. We have to forge that bond."</p>
<p>"OK," I said, "I get that. Do you want to show me the way? Or do you want us to do this together?"</p>
<p>"Together," Lindsay said with a squeak. "All of us."</p>
<p>I nodded, continuing to pet my sister's head. Like she was a frightened foal in a lightning storm.</p>
<p>Jan sat down on the other side of the bed. She reached for Lindsay's shirt and took it off, exposing another one of my sister's tight sports bras -- an aqua one. As if they'd practiced this all before, Lucy sat next to me and pulled down Lindsay's yoga pants, revealing a matching pair of panties.</p>
<p>Lindsay was gasping for air, breathing hard like we were in the middle of a difficult exercise routine. I reached for my own clothes, but my sisters stopped me. Jan took off my shirt while Lucy loosed my jeans. I wondered how they'd decided who should do what.</p>
<p>Now Lindsay and I were down to our underwear. I felt the moment was right, so I leaned down and kissed Lindsay on the lips. She wrapped her arms around me. The awkwardness of making out with my little sister was still there. It only made things feel all the more electric.</p>
<p>"Prepare him," Lindsay said, "Us."</p>
<p>Jan reached into my boxers and found my cock. She squeezed it, finding me already plenty hard. To my surprise, Lucy reached into Lindsay's panties and started rubbing her pussy.</p>
<p>"Jeez, he's already about to explode," Jan said.</p>
<p>"Same here," Lucy said, "It's almost like our younger siblings really want to fuck each other."</p>
<p>"Nasty, naughty little brother and sister," Jan said.</p>
<p>"We're ready?" Lindsay asked.</p>
<p>"Any more ready and he's going to end before we can begin," Jan said.</p>
<p>Lucy shushed her. Lindsay giggled.</p>
<p>I kept kissing my little sister. Her ears, her cheeks, her neck. Jan removed Lindsay's bra and I moved my lips down to her adorable titties. Suckling at her eager nubs. I barely even noticed as Lucy took off my boxers. As she slipped off Lindsay's bottoms. Only when my cock brushed Lindsay's heat did I realize we were both completely bare.</p>
<p>"Are you sure, Linds?" I asked. Losing your virginity to your brother, there was no going back from that.</p>
<p>"Oh yes," Lindsay said, "I want to feel your essence inside me."</p>
<p>Inside. Yeah, about that.</p>
<p>"We can do that," I said, "We will do that. But maybe it makes sense to get a condom. Or at least not finish inside you. You know, with your birth control and everything."</p>
<p>"No," Lindsay said forcefully. "I promise. It'll be OK. Perfect."</p>
<p>I looked over at Lucy. My older sister shrugged. Like impregnating our younger sister was just one of those things that happened on occasion and there was nothing to be done about it.</p>
<p>In that moment, the pie chart that was my brain divided thusly. 3% believed my sister when she said there was nothing to worry about, that she was an adult and knew her own body and was totally trustworthy. Another 29% said that relying on Lindsay was crazy -- this was the same girl who'd once told me that daffodils were friendly, but sunflowers were mean -- she was going to get knocked up for sure and I needed to stay far, far away.</p>
<p>The problem was, the other 68% of my mind which didn't care about either side and was chanting fuck that sis as loud as it could.</p>
<p>So, you can figure out how everything went down.</p>
<p>Lucy grabbed my dick, giving me a flirty smirk as she felt my hardness fill her hand. She aimed me at our little sister's center. And just like that, my cockhead kissed at the entrance of Lindsay's tiny quim.</p>
<p>"Ready, Linds?" I asked.</p>
<p>The cute brunette nodded, vigorously. I slid forward. I felt a mix of conflicting sensations. The heat of Lindsay's pussy grabbing hold as the warmth of Lucy's hand fell away. I sank into my sister, bare. Everything went blank.</p>
<p>All I could feel were the wondrous sensations as Lindsay's lovely cunt slipped around me. Wet and wanting. Tighter than anything I'd ever felt. Hotter too. Like sliding into a gasping, groaning volcano.</p>
<p>Lindsay huffed as I filled her. Her expression equal parts fear and desire. She watched my every movement. Searching. For what I cannot say. Her body beneath me rising and falling rhythmic. Her breaths coming deep and desperate.</p>
<p>"Ssssssooooo deep," Lindsay groaned.</p>
<p>"You've got this," Lucy said. She gave me an inquisitive look.</p>
<p>"Almost all," I said.</p>
<p>I slipped in the last inch. My balls bounced against my sister's bottom. Both of us sighed -- a sound that spoke of relief, delight, and concern all at once. We'd done it, completely. I was buried to the end in my baby sister. Her pussy was fully filled with my cock. Everything that entailed, it held us enraptured for a moment.</p>
<p>"Well don't just lie there," Jan snapped, peevish, "Fuck her for fuck's sake."</p>
<p>"Jan, you can go now," I said.</p>
<p>"No, it's OK," Lindsay said, "She can stay."</p>
<p>But my oldest sister got the message. She nodded her head, biting her lip, clearly chastened.</p>
<p>Slowly, I slid back in Lindsay, then drove forward. She hissed like she was scalded. Like I was the source of that molten heat, instead of her. For a moment, I thought I'd hurt her.</p>
<p>"Just. Getting used," Lindsay said.</p>
<p>I knew what she meant. My sister's clasping, steaming eighteen-year-old pussy was something new to be sure. With every breath, I worried I was about to break loose. And while she'd already told me it was safe to cum, I knew I needed to make Lindsay's first time more special than a pump and dump.</p>
<p>Lindsay, on her side, wasn't helping things. She was figuring out her body, shifting and squeezing to see what felt the best. How she could eke out her own pleasure.</p>
<p>"Mmmm... that's nice," Lindsay said. She was off in her own universe.</p>
<p>Unable to hold back my urges any longer, I started to slide back and forth in my sister. Lindsay groaned as I moved. At first, I thought it might be pain, but I saw from the look in her eyes that it was all pleasure.</p>
<p>"That looks so nice," Lucy said, absently in my ear. I didn't need to look to know her fingers were in her own snatch.</p>
<p>"It's so bad," Jan said, openly strumming herself, as well.</p>
<p>"It's so gooood," Lindsay sighed, "Such a good brother. Making me feel so... AH!"</p>
<p>I'd reached down and found Lindsay's clit. I knew I didn't have long, and I needed to get her off. I'd worked my little sister enough times to have a pretty good idea of rhythm and pace. Her tiny, well-muscled body bucked as I rubbed her. Her pussy, impossibly, tightened. To the point where I was sure she was about to rip my cock right off.</p>
<p>Lindsays squeaked. She squealed. A throaty chuckle escaped her lips, and she went over the top. Body straining.</p>
<p>"Oh... Goddess..." The words slipped out of her mouth unbidden. Like the hiss from a tea kettle. All the pressure pushing them loose.</p>
<p>Finally, Lindsay fell back to the bed.</p>
<p>"Cum," she told me, with a firmness of voice I'd never heard from her. Like she was channeling Jan. "Cum in me!"</p>
<p>I looked over at Lucy. My older sister gave me a funny little smirk.</p>
<p>"You heard the girl," Jan said on my other side, sharply.</p>
<p>"Nuh-need you to cum. So deep!" Lindsay said.</p>
<p>"It's not a... I can't just flip a switch," I said.</p>
<p>All three of my sisters gave me a doubting look.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't know what I was arguing. I'd been close before we started so how near was I now? I guess I wanted to prolong that feeling of being inside my little sister. Feeling her body surround me.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>But Lindsay had demanded I cum so that's what I was going to do. I stopped moving slowly. I grabbed my sister's shoulders for purchase and started plowing her. Our hips slapping with each pump.</p>
<p>"Oh! My! GoddESS!" Lindsay screamed. If our parents really were home, they'd be breaking down the door any second.</p>
<p>The room filled with the sounds of me full-on fucking Lindsay. The claps of our pubic bones clashing. The mewls and gasps from my sister, her legs hanging in the air like a bird readying to land on a branch. The wet, sloppy noises of Lucy and Jan on either side. Both of them sounded ready to peak, themselves.</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh you naughty boy. Making sissy CUM!" Jan cried out.</p>
<p>"Give it to her OH! So good..." Lucy groaned.</p>
<p>"Yes! Fuck me! Fill me... OH!" Lindsay gasped.</p>
<p>And finally, buried as deep as I could, I inseminated my little sister. The pleasure raced down my shaft. Up my back and through my body. Radiating out of me with the heat and energy of a collapsing star.</p>
<p>"Oh! I feel it!" Lindsay cried out. "Feel him. Filling me!"</p>
<p>I buried my head in the crook of Lindsay's shoulder. My eyes squeezed shut. Jaw locked tight. Like each joyful burst was taking tremendous effort. As if hosing the walls of my sister's womb took every last bit of my energy.</p>
<p>Lindsay's legs closed languid around me. She let out a long, deep, "ohhhhhhhh."</p>
<p>I felt hands on my body. Lucy on one flank, Jan on the other. Both of them petting, soothing.</p>
<p>"That's it, you got her," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Yeah... yuh. Got me," Lindsay said. "Got me so good."</p>
<p>"Such a good big brother," Jan said.</p>
<p>I felt myself soften. Everything felt sticky and hot. I rolled off my sister, leaving my last trail of spend on her thin thigh. Lindsay rolled over and kissed me.</p>
<p>"Connected?" I asked.</p>
<p>"You tell me," she said, smiling playfully.</p>
<p>"Definitely," I said. I meant it. There was a closeness there, even with our other sisters in the room. I felt linked to Lindsay in a totally different way. Like puzzle pieces, our bodies aligned.</p>
<p>"I think we'll need to do that again," Lindsay said, "To please the goddess. You know."</p>
<p>"Whatever she needs," I said, already drifting away in the arms of my loving siblings.</p>
<p>"Come."</p>
<p>I was lying in bed, staring up at the ceiling. Once the post-coital bliss had washed away, I was left with the cold rationality of what had happened. What we'd done. What I'd given my little sister. It was glorious, yes, but scary too. Again, I thought about Lindsay's lack of birth control. Would it be so bad if I impregnated her? I mean, yes. Of course. No doubt.</p>
<p>But would it really?</p>
<p>After the big event I'd gone back to making dinner. The pasta was way overdone and the sauce was lukewarm at best, but no one was willing to complain. Not even my parents who, having come home from work to a warm meal, were more than happy to eat and then shuffle off to bed in silence.</p>
<p>In some ways, it only made me resent them more. Our baby sister was stumbling around the house with the quivering legs and dopey expression of someone who had been obviously, completely fucked to the fullest and they didn't even blink. I almost wanted to shout in their faces. But whatever. That time was coming soon enough.</p>
<p>I cleared off dinner and went to bed. I was expecting a nice, easy sleep. Instead, the 'what-if' monsters started whispering in my ear. So, I stared at the ceiling, obsessing about all the things I couldn't control. And the many things I could affect but didn't care.</p>
<p>It was this odd sensation. There was something I was supposed to do. I was sure of it. But, for the life of me, I couldn't figure out what that was.</p>
<p>My phone buzzed. And that fateful word once again appeared on my screen.</p>
<p>And I knew.</p>
<p>"This afternoon got you worked up, huh?" I said, sidling into my oldest sister's bedroom.</p>
<p>Jan was lying back on her bed. She had her black hair up in a bun and was wearing thick-framed glasses. She had on the sexy, silky kimono, as well. The words came to my mind, once again.</p>
<p>Smoke show.</p>
<p>There truly was no better way to describe my big sis.</p>
<p>"Like you wouldn't believe," Jan said, "Naughty little brother. Knocking up our little sister."</p>
<p>I paused by the side of the bed. I hoped that Jan was only doing dirty talk. Our plans were going to be hard to pull off already without adding that to the mix.</p>
<p>Jan must have seen my concern because her face softened. "Oh, Dylan," she said, "It'll all be fine, I promise. I'm just playing."</p>
<p>"OK," I said. I sat down on the bed. Jan scooched next to me resting her head on my shoulder.</p>
<p>"It is kind of hot though," Jan said, "Thinking about it."</p>
<p>"Is it now?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Mmhm," Jan said. "Think about how bad it is. You made our little sissy cum. You filled her fertile womb with your sticky, sibling seed. All those naughty brother spermies, bursting into her most precious, special place. Oh, big brother. You're not supposed to go in there."</p>
<p>"Fucking hell, Jan," I said. My older sister really was sick in the head. But only in the best of ways.</p>
<p>"What do you think, brother? You want to be bad again?"</p>
<p>I leaned over and took Jan's glasses off her head. I pulled the band off her bun, letting her dark hair spill free.</p>
<p>"You like doing that, don't you," Jan said, "Breaking me down."</p>
<p>"Only because you like having it done," I said.</p>
<p>Jan chortled. She untied her kimono, revealing her pale, perfect body to me. Her breasts sat high on her chest, nipples so tight and sharp I'd swear they could slice.</p>
<p>I took off my shirt and shucked my pajama pants. Both of us lay back in her bed, naked. Jan lifted her legs and spread them. I grabbed hold of my cock. I was sure she was about to reach into her drawer, but Jan grabbed my hand, instead. Holding me back from stroking.</p>
<p>"Nuh uh," Jan said. She bucked her hips with meaning.</p>
<p>"Wow, this afternoon really go you worked up, huh?"</p>
<p>Jan nodded enthusiastically. She tried to pull me over to her.</p>
<p>"But it's so wrong," I said, drawing out that last word the way Jan liked. "You're not supposed to fuck your little brother."</p>
<p>"Please," Jan said, "Just this once. I promise I'll be good."</p>
<p>"You like that? Corrupting me? Showing your baby bro your hot, little pussy. Begging him to shove it inside you like a slut?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh."</p>
<p>I crawled over Jan, pushing her legs even further apart. I grabbed my cock and steered it to her center. As I did, Jan switched roles.</p>
<p>"Please no, little brother," she said, "Don't. It's not supposed to go in me."</p>
<p>"I can't stop," I said, "Need it so bad."</p>
<p>"But brother it's so wrong. You're not supposed to feel my hungry little pussy." Jan grabbed my hips as she said it. Drawing me forward.</p>
<p>The head of my cock kissed her pussy lips, then slid, inexorably inside. Jan's cunt wasn't nearly as tight as Lindsay's and was warm, rather than hot. It hardly mattered. She squeezed down as I entered her, and it felt like entering heaven.</p>
<p>Jan groaned as I filled her.</p>
<p>"You like that?" I asked. "Feeling your baby brother inside you?"</p>
<p>"Oh! My brother has the best cock," Jan said.</p>
<p>"Best you've ever had?" I asked.</p>
<p>Jan paused. We'd done the teasing sibling thing, but making her confess she liked me better than her boyfriend was a different kink.</p>
<p>"You're the biggest," Jan said, "You're the best."</p>
<p>"You'll only take my cock from now on," I told her.</p>
<p>"Yes," Jan said, surprisingly supplicant. "I promise."</p>
<p>I drew back and thrust into my sister, hard. Her bed thunked against the wall. Unlike with Lindsay, I didn't take my time. I didn't worry about whether my sister was enjoying this or not. I railed into her with abandon. Thrusting and pumping with no rhythm or care. Just the driving need of rutting. Biological beyond words.</p>
<p>"Fuh-fuck." Jan tried to get the words out but my aggression wouldn't let her. "Fucking. My. Brother. So. BAD."</p>
<p>I pulled out and smacked Jan's butt. She got the hint and rolled over onto all fours. Presented her ass to me. She bent her head down, burying it in her arms. Ass pointing upwards. Waggling back and forth. I wondered if she was even aware she was doing it.</p>
<p>I grabbed hold of Jan's perfect ass cheeks and drove home once again.</p>
<p>"Oh YES!" Jan cried out as I plunged into her.</p>
<p>She reached back and pinched her nipple so hard, I swore I felt it too. Her whole body went rigid. Jan growled. Her flesh went pink from top to bottom, like a sudden fever. She stilled.</p>
<p>A second later, Jan sucked in a massive gasp of air. "Oh. Oh fuck. Oh fuck."</p>
<p>"You OK?" I asked, genuinely concerned.</p>
<p>"Fuck yeah. Oh fuck that was good," Jan said, "Oh FUCK!"</p>
<p>She grabbed her nipple again and twisted, taking herself right over the top again. Jan machine-gunned through her orgasms, cumming so hard I worried we'd have to go to the hospital after. If she ever came down at all.</p>
<p>But all of that sister-pleasure was more than I could take. I thought, after everything, that I'd last way longer. I was already at the precipice. It's weird, I was kind of disappointed in myself.</p>
<p>Jan, however, had no problem at all with my timing. "Bad. Little brother. You can't -- uhn! -- cum in me."</p>
<p>It no longer mattered what she said. My peak was so close, I could fall forward and topple right over it. That's more or less what happened, actually. I thrusted, filling my sister with my fertility.</p>
<p>"Oh FUCK!" Jan cried out. "My brother's cummming in ME!"</p>
<p>The force of my orgasm overtook me. I thought I'd cum hard before. This was almost more. It was violent, each burst like a cannon shot. Shaking me. Aching. My fingers dug into Jan's ass so hard, I'd leave little bruises. I buried myself deep in my sister, delivering load after load of hot, wriggling brother-cum. Searching her body, deep.</p>
<p>"Oh yes," Jan said, "Oh fuck. Such a good little brother. Giving sissy all you've got."</p>
<p>Her mumbling trailed off. I collapsed forward, both of us falling to the bed in a slippery heap. Our juices pooling on Jan's sheets. My oldest sister took my head in her hands, hard. She kissed me, squeezing my skull like she was trying to crack it open. Her tongue forced its way into my mouth. I could barely breathe but it didn't matter.</p>
<p>"You came in me," Jan said.</p>
<p>"Yuh-huh," I said.</p>
<p>She gave me a scared little look that turned into a huge grin. "That was awesome," Jan said.</p>
<p>"Uh huh," I said.</p>
<p>Finally, I felt like I could sleep.</p>
<p>"Holy fuck that's hot."</p>
<p>Lucy and I were sitting at our table, finishing off the last of a luxurious meal. This restaurant was one of the hottest in town, but I'd managed to score a reservation from a buddy who worked as a dishwasher in the back. I guess I still had a few connections in town that were worth keeping.</p>
<p>The meal had been decadent, so rich it actually made me dizzy. The bottle of wine we split didn't hurt (they only checked Lucy's ID, thankfully). Of course, the conversation was what truly put me over the top. I didn't realize how hot it would be to tell Lucy about what had happened with Jan. Especially since she demanded such exacting detail.</p>
<p>"What'd you do after that?" Lucy asked.</p>
<p>I gave my blonde, buxom sister an evaluating look. What'd she expect?</p>
<p>"I went to sleep," I said, "What? You thought I'd be up all night pounding her into the bed? Please, I'm an actual human being. Not some porn story character."</p>
<p>"Well, that would have been hot," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"I'd probably be dead," I said.</p>
<p>"Well you'd better not just wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am with me," Lucy said, "I've got expectations, you know."</p>
<p>"Understood," I said, looking down at my crotch. Hope you can hold up, little man.</p>
<p>After dinner, we shared a chocolate truffle platter, then I paid the check. This meal was going to be dear, especially in the context of everything else we had going on. But Lucy was worth it.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we drove back home. It was late in the evening and the house was quiet. My parents had passed out long ago and our other sisters had already been warned. We went up to Lucy's bedroom and shut the door behind us.</p>
<p>My older sister leaned over and gave me a little kiss on the lips. A tease of what was to come. She was wearing a bright red dress that looked so good on her curvy body, I couldn't wait to rip it off her.</p>
<p>Lucy hugged me close. She let her lips trail across my cheek and linger at my ear.</p>
<p>"I want to try something different tonight," Lucy whispered.</p>
<p>"Anal?!"</p>
<p>"No, you dope," Lucy smacked me on the shoulder, playfully. "I mean, maybe. Eventually. It would, um, address some other problems. But no. Not that."</p>
<p>I eyed my sister. We'd done so much dirty stuff together, beginning with humping the floor together and eventually, well, everything. Honestly, what more could two people share?</p>
<p>"I want to make love," Lucy said.</p>
<p>I smiled. Carefully, piece by piece, I stripped my sister bare. I laid her down on the bed, kissing every inch of her. We moved slowly. Savoring. Appreciating every second we had together.</p>
<p>When we finally joined, it felt like a natural step in our journey with each other. Our bodies perfectly aligned. I'd connected with Lindsay, yes. And Jan and I had, well, I guess you'd call it an elemental understanding. But it was nothing compared to this. What Lucy and I had, it was almost an insult to call it love. We were bonded down to our atoms. Intercourse was only another expression of it.</p>
<p>Lucy and I made love on her bed for what felt like hours. Every time we felt the end approaching, we pulled back. Taking our time to build each other to the perfect ending.</p>
<p>But, finally, my stamina started to give. I could feel the end coming and there was no stopping it. Even if I pulled out, I knew I'd end up spurting on the floor.</p>
<p>Lucy must have felt it because she spurred me onwards. I knew she'd cum at least a couple times, but it wasn't something I'd been counting. What we were doing, it was more than that. Orgasms were only little punctuation marks in the story of our bodies that we told each other that night.</p>
<p>But when I finally went over the top -- as I buried myself deep in my beautiful blonde sister -- right before my inevitable explosion, Lucy whispered in my ear.</p>
<p>"I know that Lindsay has her whole 'chakra' thing," Lucy said, "And Jan's 'naughty sibling' stuff. Well, I've figured out, I've got a little kink of my own."</p>
<p>"What?" I asked, my body straining to hold back for just a moment more.</p>
<p>"Impregnation," Lucy said. She let the word slip out, like it was the most delicious thing she'd ever tasted.</p>
<p>My older sister grabbed my ass and thrust me forward. My orgasm raced over me. I thought I was tipping off the cliff. I leapt right off the mountainside. The edging of the entire evening. The love for my sister. The racing fear and wonder of that word. All of it combined to blow me out beyond anything I'd ever experienced.</p>
<p>I think I shouted. I know Lindsay did. I filled my sister with an ardor I didn't think was humanly possible. Whatever sounds we made. The feelings we had. I can't describe it in a way that would make sense in any human language.</p>
<p>It was the most glorious, flowering burst of ecstasy I've ever known. It warmed me to my soul. It ground me down to dust. I felt my entire body unravel to the proteins, then slowly zip itself back together. Lucy screaming her pleasure in my ear.</p>
<p>When I regained consciousness, the love of my life was cradling me in her arms.</p>
<p>"Better than a pillow?" I asked her, playfully.</p>
<p>Lucy shook her head and laughed.</p>
<p>In the end, we let my parents catch us.</p>
<p>I know it sounds stupid, but we wanted one big blow out to tie everything together. Plus, the whole 'eff you' aspect of it. I won't lie that it really appealed.</p>
<p>We were all completely naked in the living room when Mom and Dad came home. I won't describe the exact details. Let's just say that my dick was slick from two different sister-pussies already and was in the process of plumbing a third when the door flew open, and my parents shouted like they'd been shot.</p>
<p>Mom was apoplectic. Dad turned so purple, he looked like he would burst. We made a big show of grabbing our things, hurriedly, as we ran out of the house. It was all fake; we'd been slowly taking stuff out of there for weeks already.</p>
<p>The four of us piled into the car and sped off, the shouts of our parents ringing in our ears. For a moment it felt serious. Scary.</p>
<p>Then the reality of what we'd done hit us and we all started laughing, hysterically.</p>
<p>We were finally free.</p>
<p>"Come here," I said, calling Lucy into my room.</p>
<p>It was hot as eff that summer, but the air conditioning in our little brownstone was working fine. Lucy was wearing shorts and a t-shirt, her buxom body bouncing perfectly as she passed in the hallway.</p>
<p>She glanced over at me, curiously.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Lucy asked.</p>
<p>"Do you think this picture is straight?" I asked. We'd been here for a while, but I wasn't done decorating. Getting everything right in our new place was taking longer than I'd imagined it would. I was pretty OK with that.</p>
<p>Lucy came into my room and pushed the frame slightly. "This is lovely," she said, looking at the picture.</p>
<p>"Jan got it for me," I said.</p>
<p>"It suits you," she said.</p>
<p>"The place is coming together nicely," I said.</p>
<p>"It's OK," Lucy said, "I'm still getting used to sharing bedrooms."</p>
<p>"Yeah, cause that's such a burden," I said.</p>
<p>Lucy, to her credit, blushed a little. "It can be awkward sometimes, hearing my brother share his 'inner fire' with our little sister."</p>
<p>"You heard that, last night, huh?"</p>
<p>"Or having to listen while he fills my older sis with his 'bad little brother spermies.'"</p>
<p>"You caught that too, I guess."</p>
<p>"Yyyyyyyyup," Lucy said. "Kinda hard to miss when you're in the same room."</p>
<p>"Well, if you'd like, I'm sure I can find you some extra pillows," I said, "You know, to drown it all out."</p>
<p>Lucy slapped my shoulder, but then she hugged me around the shoulders, resting her head near my neck.</p>
<p>"Speaking of pillows, have you heard anything from Kara recently?" I asked.</p>
<p>"We haven't spoken since the Christmas Miracle," Lucy said, "But I heard through the grapevine that she left school, and her older brother broke his engagement. So, I guess that tells you everything you need to know. Why, you think we need another roommate?"</p>
<p>"No," I said, "Just thinking. It'd be nice to have an ally. Someone to confide in, at least."</p>
<p>Lucy made a show of thinking about it. "I'll give her a call," she said, "Speaking of allies, you hear from Mom and Dad?"</p>
<p>"I've gotten some nasty voicemails," I said, "But that's to be expected. I still feel bad about how we did things."</p>
<p>"Not our best moment," Lucy said.</p>
<p>"Not by far," I said.</p>
<p>"Don't be too hard on yourself," Lucy said, "We did what we thought was best in the moment. Also, it was pretty fucking funny."</p>
<p>"Truth," I said. I nudged the frame on the wall again. Lucy pushed it back. We glared at each other. A little smile formed on my sister's lips. She nodded her head. Jutted her chin. I looked down at the floor.</p>
<p>My phone rang and I picked it up. It was my new job, asking if I could pick up some extra hours that afternoon. Lucy eyed me. I could see she was disappointed, but she knew it had to be done. Things were going to work out, but only if we worked at them. If that meant sacrificing sometimes, then so be it. At least we knew we were truly taking control of our own lives.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "Absolutely. Happy to come in. Just, if you don't mind, could it wait about an hour? I've got something pressing I need to deal with."</p>
<p>I put my phone down on my bed. Lucy clapped her hands and grinned, leaning in to kiss me. The job could wait for a little bit.</p>
<p>After all, what's more important than family?</p>
