<p>The Ten Pines Mall was a place where bad business ideas went to die. The business case was that just off a major freeway with a huge car park, the mall would be the easiest thing in the world to drive to and park. Unfortunately it was built in the middle of one of the most remote parts of South Carolina, nobody wanted to drive hours on the freeway for a mall with very similar shops to an average town high street. It closed five years after it opened, a glass and concrete monolith proclaiming the folly of hubristic spending assumptions from investors who'd never set foot in South Carolina.</p>
<p>When the mall went under, it bounced from one investor to another, each time the pattern was the same, they'd be thrilled that they managed to get a great location for their new conference centre/holiday resort/cineplex, and at such a cheap price as well. Then every time the cost of refurbishment would hit home and business analysts would come in to tell their bosses what a toxic investment it was, it would be sold on at another loss to another suit looking for a location for their pet project.</p>
<p>The most recent investor to go under at least had the stamina to convert a large section of the mall to fancy apartments before they went bankrupt. It seemed the only business able to thrive in the area was Grimsdottir and Skrive, the bankruptcy attorneys earning a sweet commission every time they sold the building yet again.</p>
<p>Hilda Grimsdottir resented her dad using his</p>
<p>connections to secure her a house in the hastily converted housing corner of the mall. Sure she now outright owned a two bedroom apartment that used to be a ski shop and staff room, but the money she saved on rent or a mortgage, she lost on petrol spending half her life driving to Big Mike's, the biker bar she worked at. Even more than that she hated putting down roots in a part of South Carolina she had always been determined to move away from. Now she had an unsellable apartment tethering her to a land of parental disapproval at her lack of "success" (which meant living her life exactly how they wanted), not to mention the locals treating her like a raving maniac for daring to have purple hair in a pixie cut, punk rock clothes that didn't fit the little house on the prairie look they wanted girls of her age to have, and headstrong attitude that didn't fit the little house on the prairie submission they wanted girls of her age to have.</p>
<p>Because of this Hilda spent a lot of time at home watching TV on her off days. One day when her internet went down and she found herself behind the TV fiddling with the tangle of wires that included the ethernet cable, she leant a bit hard on the wall and felt a section fall away under her weight. As she brushed herself off and straightened up, she found herself looking out into the echoing darkness of an abandoned mall.</p>
<p>Hilda stayed silent, she was excited at the prospect of exploring and didn't want any potential security guards or other residents to spoil it too early. As she wandered from one large liminal space to another, illuminating her walk with the torch in her phone, she worked out that she was truly alone here. The legal limbo of bankruptcy and ownership disputes meant the building had no organisation willing to pay for even the most basic security presence, and every other house that had been Frankensteined from the building had walls that were still intact. As she went from one darkened room to the next, she eventually hit upon a mesmerising discovery.</p>
<p>The room was a swirl of churning lights from the cars underneath, it was a glass box dangling appetisingly over the freeway. Originally designed for a car dealership to park their most appealing cars to advertise both their fabulous prices and the glamour of the mall at the next turning, it now stood empty as Hilda walked in and floated above the busy world. The hum of traffic bustling beneath her feet as she serenely sat cross-legged and marvelled at the oasis she had found.</p>
<p>Five minutes later she dropped her serenity as she had just thought of a great way to make some money.</p>
<p>Hilda couldn't believe she'd been paid a grand just to put up a large banner advertising a crypto currency website in the glass room above the freeway for a week. More crazy, it seemed to be a lowball offer because they were taking a risk investing in an ad opportunity they found in a random forum post online, with Hilda's pictures from her phone the only proof of her claims that she could perform the task she had been paid for.</p>
<p>Hilda had decided to be extra cautious just in case. She had the banner sent to one of the lobby postboxes for an apartment Hilda knew was unoccupied and the company's crypto systems were used to indirectly pay her. She even wore a beanie hat, some sunglasses and a face mask as she unfurled the banner up against the glass just before heading to work. As she drove past it on the freeway, it was visible and prominent, she was certain her paymasters would be happy with the result.</p>
<p>When she got back home after a shift at the bar, her inbox had exploded with offers to use the space from previously sceptical businesses.</p>
<p>For the next couple of weeks Hilda had no scruples in deciding what was in the freeway room, she simply put whatever the highest bidder wanted up there. After the crypto site the next ad was for an online vape shop, then for a dating website.</p>
<p>As the room became more established, so to did the adverts evolve. A music festival actually sent her over a cardboard stage and disco lights that she was allowed to keep after their ad period was over. Despite all this there was one rule Hilda kept to; no matter what, she was the only one who could go in that room. After all, her method of access was the thing these places were buying, if she let their technicians or marketing bods come over to set it up themselves, it would be inevitable that they would try to cut her out. She also starting putting bike locks on the three separate doorways someone would need to walk through to get to the room.</p>
<p>This is why she was so conflicted when she got her largest offer ever from a gambling website, Lucky Rabbit Games, but on the condition that a model dressed as a lucky rabbit be allowed to stand in the booth for three of the days waving at cars. As always Hilda asked if the model would be a deal-breaker, and the website said that without a model there was no deal.</p>
<p>Hilda, desperate to salvage the deal and get the huge payday, made an offer in haste that she would later regret.</p>
<p>'Add a model's salary to the fee and I could do it.' She replied, hitting send on the email before her mind could jump in with what she had just offered. The website was obviously also interested in salvaging this advertising idea and replied with.</p>
<p>'Maybe, the model was going to be in a rabbit mask so looks aren't that important. However they were also going to be wearing a revealing outfit. If you have the body for it we would be willing to bend. Please send us some current pictures of you in your underwear and confirm you would be comfortable in this role and we'll make a decision from there.'</p>
<p>Hilda's stomach let out a little gurgle of nerves as she weighed the offer. She had never been ashamed of her body, and the comments of the patrons at the bar regularly strayed into horny compliments so she certainly knew she would be able to impress the marketing guy she was emailing with. (If she didn't have the body, the kind of bikers who frequented Big Mike's would certainly let her know.) But the thought of modelling, standing in that booth and showing off her body to passing cars, was a whole different matter. She had never been the type to show off and smile, the cheerleaders at her school more commonly the target of her hatred and ridicule than envy.</p>
<p>Her attitude swayed wildly, one moment she was telling herself the money was far better than the next best offer and maybe it would be a bit of fun, the next it was crazy and she didn't want people lusting over her as she showed some skin for their benefit like some exhibitionist bimbo.</p>
<p>Hilda stripped down to her underwear in front of a mirror and admired herself, she turned and twisted to look at her body from all angles and smiled, it had been a long time since she had last slept with someone. It had been a terrible experience with a particularly clingy biker girl which made her swear off sleeping with bar patrons. As bar patrons were the only new people she met, this pretty much hit pause on her sex life.</p>
<p>She then stripped off her underwear and admired what was beneath, her body was pretty well toned from poverty food portion sizes and being on her feet several hours a day serving beers. If she took this offer she knew she would have to shave her legs, armpits, and at least a large part of her pubis. Her stomach was in proportion, but she felt it could be more toned and resolved to start doing some sort of core exercise routine. The brown roots were as much a part of her hair as the purple dye applied months ago, she'd have to grab some more bleach and dye.</p>
<p>As she continued to look herself over, a bolt of revelation struck Hilda. Ever since she had moved into her new apartment, she had stopped caring about a lot in her life, feeling stuck had taken away her passion to do pretty much anything. But ever since she discovered this ad space, she had felt less trapped. With this new purpose had actually grown the resolve to do something with her life. It became clear as she was looking in the mirror and making all these plans that they weren't idle suggestions that she would inevitably not follow through on, she was genuinely in the mood to work on herself. So she decided whatever this business venture was doing could only be good for her, and she needed to jump in with both feet.</p>
<p>Later that day, before she headed to work, Hilda took a diversion to a nearby town to go shopping. She had a nice store of savings from her ad revenue so didn't hesitate to buy an epilator, various skin creams, some exercise equipment, and some new hair dye. Upon reflection she also decided to get herself a blonde wig, as her signature purple hair would probably give away her identity pretty quickly if anyone was looking into her scheme.</p>
<p>Next she had to drive an extra hour out of her way to visit a shop that sold lingerie, figuring if the gambling company wanted a picture of her body in underwear, she might as well put her best foot forward on that front. She ended up surprising herself with the sheer variety of sexy underwear she ended up loading into her car boot, hoping nobody broke in and saw what she had during her shift at the Big Mike's that night.</p>
<p>Hilda's feet ached as she stepped back into her house, her shift seemed to last forever with her mind firmly on her plans for afterwards. She was tired, but she knew she wouldn't get a wink of sleep if she didn't do everything she had planned in her mind first.</p>
<p>Hilda followed the epilator instructions to the letter, exfoliating her skin before running the device over her and gritting her teeth as it mechanically removed all her body hair. She trimmed her pubic hair right back and epilated the outskirts but left a little tuft to give her vagina some definition. Next she showered, moisturised, and generally washed off the day's filth so she would feel ready to try on some lingerie.</p>
<p>Hilda spent more time than was prudent running her hands up and down her newly soft and smooth skin, before she turned to her shopping. One by one she tried on every naughty piece and lacy number, each time thrilled at what she saw in the mirror. Eventually she had to make the agonising choice of which one she would use for her photos.</p>
<p>For starters Hilda needed the right bra to go with her breasts. They were sizable but slender and pointy, earning her the nicknanes banana boobs and torpedo tits at various times in the bar. The matching panties would have to be just right for her toned bottom and untoned stomach. Then there was the question of how much she wanted to cover considering she was meant to be showing off her body. Would suspenders help or hinder her chances? How about high heels which would be very flattering on her legs and ass but out of place if she wasn't wearing much?</p>
<p>Eventually she came to a conclusion, she went with the half cup lacy red bra, showing off ample cleavage while allowing her bust to jut out as far from her body as physics would allow, paired with the matching red lace skinny hipsters. In the end she also decided against high heels as the only ones she owned were left over from her prom years ago.</p>
<p>Hilda started taking photos, firstly unposed, just giving an impression of what her body looked like. Then she started getting naughty angles, she'd bend and contort to bring out the sexiness of the situation until her phone filled up with her lavicious photoshoot. She chose the best photos where you couldn't see her face and hair to send off to the marketing men, then surprised herself by spending the rest of the morning playing with herself under the covers until she fell asleep in the afterglow of her orgasms. This was not the person Hilda thought she was, but her content sleep and kinky dreams seemed to disagree.</p>
<p>Hilda stared at the outfit Lucky Rabbit Games had sent over with the ad materials, then stared at it again. She couldn't believe what she was holding, she couldn't believe every part of the path that led to this moment.</p>
<p>She couldn't believe that a woman whose first unsupervised clothes purchase was baggy jeans, a rude band t-shirt, and a chrome studded leather belt would want to be seen in lingerie so badly. She couldn't believe a woman who at age of 13 once told an arch-bishop go fuck himself would hold her tongue as some distant marketing department criticised every minute flaw in photos of her body. She certainly couldn't believe that a bartender who once stared down a leader of a biker gang until he caved and agreed to pay for the damage he did to the pool table, had been so desperate to follow through on this deal that not only did she agree to waive the modelling fee, but also gave them a discount to compensate for her body being not quite 'up to Lucky Rabbit Games brand standards.'</p>
<p>Hilda was certain how she was seen by the marketing department was also reflected in their choice of outfit for her. She knew the lingerie would be on the theme of "Lucky Rabbit" (which didn't make sense as it was the foot that was lucky not the whole rabbit, but this was yet another thing Hilda held her tongue about.) She was expecting something that mostly ripped off a playboy bunny outfit (in fact that is exactly what the marketing department originally had in mind until they figured they could get away with sending her something more scandalous.)</p>
<p>She turned the small white bra over in her hands, the lace trim with red bows framing cups of a fine stretchy mesh that became less opaque the more Hilda stretched them over her hands. The matching high waist knickers similarly trimmed and with a red bow on above her pubis. The fine fabric barely covering her modesty before narrowing significantly to ensure her bottom was pretty much uncovered except for the small of her back where a white tufty bunny tail puffed out.</p>
<p>They had also sent over a white garter belt that connected to fine white stockings, wrist cuffs, and a collar, all trimmed with the same matching white lace trim and red ribbon bows. Finally they had provided clear platform heels that Hilda was very uncertain she would be able to gracefully move around in.</p>
<p>Hilda put the outfit out of her mind as she set out in the middle of the night to set up the rest of the advert, a large cardboard construction of a roulette wheel built at an angle facing the road with a sign above it for the promotion and branding. She marvelled that despite such a complex construction she moved through it smoothly with ease, the previous ad campaigns of the room giving her more and more skill at these sorts of rudimentary building projects.</p>
<p>Once done she went to bed and set her alarm for 4pm, the contract stated she had to pose next to the roulette wheel and wave to traffic between 5pm and 6pm the next day.</p>
<p>She awoke to her alarm, she had deliberately only given herself enough time to put on her outfit and head to her station, no wiggle room to think and for doubts to creep in. She stood in front of the mirror the entire time, watching her work uniform come together. As she suspected when she stretched the bra over her breasts, the darker tone of her nipples became just about visible through the weave. She pulled on the knickers, as she was not usually comfortable with thongs it took her some time to get used to the fabric delving into her buttcrack, time she spent staring at the clear dark shadow of her pubic hair visible through the fabric. She briefly wondered if she should shave her pussy completely, but eventually decided there wasn't enough time to do a good job of it.</p>
<p>The cuffs and accessories went on without a fuss and soon she stood in-front of her mirror, agape and willing herself on to the next part of this insane scheme. She put on her wig, then her rabbit mask and gawped at the totally different woman staring at her. She was Hilda Grimsdottir, angry punk girl who once sabotaged a building site at night because one of the builders made fun of her wearing a leather jacket on a hot summer's day. The reflection looking back at her was a smiling model in a borderline pornographic outfit getting ready to smile and wave at cars.</p>
<p>She took a step away from the mirror.</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>Every step was agonisingly filled with indecision, but the clock on her microwave flickered in the corner with a reminder she didn't have time for this.</p>
<p>In the end she decided to quickly throw some comfortable shoes, baggy trousers, and t-shirt into her backpack as well as her phone, wallet and keys so she had what she needed for a quick retreat. Then she climbed behind her TV and into the abandoned mall.</p>
<p>Hilda's heart was thundering in her chest as she heard the sound of her unsteady heels clicking against the commercial tile floors and echoing into the darkness. Every step reminded her of the outfit she had chosen to put on and the thought of soon being seen in it. She pictured people hiding in the darkness, wondering what this crazy girl was up to venturing through their domain in lingerie, and embraced the sinister fantasy until she was at the door to the fabled car showroom that she had converted into advertising space. The key to the bike lock across the door shook in Hilda's hands until she was able to shove it into the lock and open the door.</p>
<p>Daylight flowed over Hilda's body as she looked out over the room, the faint roar of car engines seemed to reverberate through her body. She took a deep breath, plastered a smile across her face and strode forward as confidently as she could on unfamiliar heels. She leant against the cardboard roulette table structure, partly to convey the look of a glamorous casino showgirl, partly for support as her heels were unsteady and the reality of the situation was making her knees weak.</p>
<p>Hilda glanced down at the cars below her and a little shriek escaped her mouth. Cars were zooming beneath her, in each one that passed Hilda would see their eyes glance upwards as she posed and waved at them. At one point a car excitedly blared its horn so Hilda blew them a kiss, laughing at the attention she was getting. After a bit of time Hilda began to wonder how long had passed and how much longer she had to do this for, then she realised the only clock she had was on her phone. As she turned around to quickly go grab her phone, she could have sworn she heard tires screeching on the road below, the sound reminding her the public could pretty much see her whole bottom.</p>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>She brought her phone back with her as she came back to the table and saw a queue had formed below her, cars slowing to get a look at her body in turn slowing the cars behind them, who would then get more time to stare at Hilda, which just perpetuated the cycle.</p>
<p>The slower traffic also meant that Hilda had more time to lock eyes with drivers and passengers, drinking in their lust and having wordless conversations about her sexy situation. Responding to their mimed requests that always translated to 'objectify yourself for my arousal.' Swelling with embarrassed pride as anyone in the car had the presence of mind to get out their phone and take a picture as she danced and posed to their whims.</p>
<p>Hilda Grimsdottir, who once spat at a lifeguard for asking her to take off her leather vest in the pool, found herself doing a twirl for any man who rotated his finger in the universally recognised "give us a twirl" gesture.</p>
<p>Hilda Grimsdottir, who was once almost arrested because she took issue to a police officer's bossy tone when he asked her to move out of the way of a Thanksgiving Day parade, pushed her arms together at her sides so her breasts would plump out, them bounced up and down at another driver's request.</p>
<p>The only requests she didn't honour was when drivers asked her to flash or otherwise remove clothing. Then she would give them a naughty finger wag and send them on their way, all the while imagining what it would be like to actually do it.</p>
<p>Hilda had so much fun, she let out a genuine scream when she glanced down at her phone and saw she had been going for over an hour and a half. She was due a shift at Big Mike's after this and was now running late. She took a bow and then rushed off her stage, grabbing her bag, changing her shoes, and shoving her clothes on over the lingerie in her hurry to get to work.</p>
<p>Hilda stood behind the bar, secretly swooning with the knowledge that her lascivious outfit was still on under her larger punk clothes. Even more so when one of the other bartenders informed her to be careful as the bar was in a rowdy mood tonight.</p>
<p>"Apparently some slut was posing in a sexy outfit over the I26 and now that's all they can talk about." She disinterestedly stated as she packed up her stuff.</p>
<p>"What, so she was just posing by the side of the road?" Hilda asked, feigning ignorance and loving hearing more about her anonymous celebrity status.</p>
<p>"No, apparently she was in one of the windows of the old Ten Pines Mall, they found loads of pictures online and believe me they will be gross about it with you, so be careful and call over security if they even slightly cross a line OK?" Big Mike's was cheap with their staff, as well as only having one bartender on shift at a time, security was often whichever large biker Big Mike could cajole into sticking around for a bit. They would often be friends with most of the patrons and rarely needed to crack skills so would often just join them in drinking.</p>
<p>"Thanks Debs, see you next time." Hilda waved her co-worker out the door and sure enough the moment she was gone one of her regulars was at the bar.</p>
<p>"You didn't happen to drive by the Ten Pines Mall today did ya?" He slurred at her, above all the other good reasons to lie was that it wasn't a good idea for patrons to know which county she lived in, let alone her commute.</p>
<p>"Not my neck of the woods I'm afraid." Hilda replied.</p>
<p>"Well you certainly missed out on a show, check this out." He slurred, handing over his phone. Hilda looked down and shuddered at the photograph of her. She knew that her nipples were a bit visible when she was in her dark room looking in the mirror, but in the bright daylight outside she was barely more covered than if she had been topless. Her knickers seemed more opaque in the small areas they covered, but the dark patch of pubic hair could still be clearly made out. Although already in the haze of drunkenness, the biker could clearly see that Hilda was staring more intensely and for longer than someone with an idle curiosity. "Like what you see huh?"</p>
<p>"You ever get dressed up like that?" Another biker added, joining his friend at the bar.</p>
<p>"All the time, hell I'm pretty much wearing that exact outfit under my clothes right now." Hilda joked, eliciting laughter from the gathered patrons unaware she was telling the truth.</p>
<p>"I'd like to see that, how much to have you wear something similar for your shift?" A third biker asked. Hilda was tempted to name a high but achievable price, the sort that she could claim she was joking until some insistent bikers handed her a was of cash, a handful of lingerie, and a strong speech about the importance of keeping her word. However sensible voices prevailed.</p>
<p>"I wear the clothes I wear that fit in with everyone else here. How about you and the boys roll up in lacy underwear, maybe then I would dress to match." She joked. "Now you gonna buy some beers or are you gonna clog up the bar staring at me like dogs waiting to hump a table leg?"</p>
<p>The men laughed and dispersed, allowing Hilda to spend the rest of her shift daydreaming and occasionally seeing yet another picture or movie of her degrading performance from earlier that day.</p>
<p>When Hilda got home from her shift, she only had time for a quick nap filled with half formed dreams of depravity before she was due another shift in the ad room. While the first day of the ad campaign was a Friday so she was asked to do rush hour, for Saturday Lucky Rabbit Games instead wanted her to work lunch from midday until 1pm. She woke up the kind of groggy you only get from a nap and began to put the lingerie on again. Sensing she would have a bit more time as she wouldn't be as hesitant as the previous day, she opted to get out her epilator and finish the job on her pubic hair.</p>
<p>The time she budgeted for was quickly lost to stroking her now totally smooth pussy, giggling at how she could see her whole labia unobstructed. Even once she had put on her outfit, she had to stop and stare at the mirror, noticing in certain poses the fabric of her knickers would either camel toe, or stretch thin enough to just about make out the shape of her pussy underneath. By the time she was done admiring herself, she had to rush over as she was already late for her agreed start time.</p>
<p>Hilda once again hesitated on the precipice of the doorway, this time not fighting her nerves but drinking in the anticipation of what lay ahead. Her platform heels clicked across the floor as she once again took her position next to the roulette wheel and smiled at the cars below.</p>
<p>The effect was the same as the previous day, lingering glances quickly turning into a traffic jam of cars slowing to take in the show. Hilda now felt practiced in the movements and poses that people would wordlessly wrangle with trying to get her to understand. Today's new pose was one where she would turn around and look over her shoulder cheekily at the cars below.</p>
<p>In the previous day, she had seen the odd biker or two, never once connecting that some of them would be the same bikers she would be serving at Big Mike's later that day. Now every biker got an extra special show, she would swing her hips and jiggle her breasts as disgracefully as possible at every person astride a motorbike.</p>
<p>The shift went by too quickly, this time she had set an alarm on her phone which soon informed her it was time to leave. Just as she was about to go she saw a small cluster of bikers, deliberately moving at the same crawl as traffic to take in the view. She knew she needed to leave on a high, so she walked up to the window close enough to lock eyes with the bikers and signal they should slow down, they ended up stopping in the road, with some getting out their cameras in anticipation.</p>
<p>Firstly Hilda grabbed her knickers and yanked them up hard. With the amount of thonging at the back, it did not take much pressure for the front to go a similar way and her labia to spill over either side of the fabric. Before she could fully absorb the humiliating pussy exposure, she also grabbed the cups of her bra and raised them up so her tits were fully on display. She posed like this at the edge of the window just long enough to feel her body quiver with erotic embarrassment before squealing and beating a hasty retreat out the door.</p>
<p>Hilda practically sprinted back to her house, her mind a whirr at the extreme exposure she has just done. It made her feel dirty, it made her feel degenerate, it made her feel cheap. The weird part was her extreme happiness at feeling all those things. Then her horny mind came up with an idea to feel even cheaper and in her manic state she couldn't say no. She typed out an email with one hand while the other furiously played with her clit.</p>
<p>'Dear Lucky Rabbit Games,</p>
<p>I am writing to apologise that today's modelling session began later than expected. Although I did pose for an hour, we had agreed I would begin this at 12am when in reality I did not start until about 12:30. As an apology and gesture of good faith, I will be processing a refund of half of the advertising fee for the day.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Hilda grabbed her dildo and slammed it into her as she logged into her bank and processed the refund, squealing at the process of cheapening herself before climaxing hard as she confirmed the payment.</p>
<p>Hilda tried desperately to get in another nap before work, only to be awoken by a phone call from her dad.</p>
<p>"Hi Hilda, haven't heard from you in a while." Her father cheerily began.</p>
<p>"Our family doesn't do catch up calls, so what's come up that you need to talk to me about?"</p>
<p>"We do keep in touch even if you don't like to." Her dad replied, pausing for a moment to try and put some distance between the pleasantries and his agenda. "But while you mention it, there is something I want to run by you. Do you know of any way residents can get into the old shopping centre the housing block backs onto?"</p>
<p>"No, that place is sealed up tight, why?"</p>
<p>"Well we had a call from the cops. For a while now somebody has been putting up adverts, which hasn't been hurting anyone and probably wouldn't get prosecuted while the legal status of the land is in dispute, but the most recent advert had some obscene angles that the police have to investigate. Nothing's going to come of it unless they can find a way into the old mall to investigate and they can't find a way in. They even got ahold of a forensic architect who said short of obvious demolition work it was impossible to access the area they are claiming the crime took place in."</p>
<p>"Well nobody's been using a jackhammer around my house." Hilda replied.</p>
<p>"Alright, well keep an eye open just in case." Her dad replied before feigning some kind of legal emergency to prevent the conversation turning to personal matters before he could hang up. Hilda once again returned to her nap dreaming of the banter that would be at the Big Mike's that night.</p>
<p>Hilda was still awake and still buzzing.</p>
<p>The crowd at Big Mike's was rowdy and electric, all on the stories of Hilda's show. Hilda saw so much phone footage of her pussy wedgie and flash from more angles than she thought possible. She had heard every degrading sex act proposed and mapped out, and even overheard proposals to promote the bar in a similar fashion with her as the model. This meant that by the time she got home, she was already floating in a rabid haze of sexual deviancy.</p>
<p>Lucky Rabbit Games had contracted her to once again stand in the booth from midday to 1pm, from the moment she got home from working at the bar to when she needed to get ready, she spent her time watching exhibitionism porn while masturbating to the edge of climax and no further. She knew today was her last day modelling and she wanted to be in a frame of mind to make it special.</p>
<p>Hilda threw on her outfit and dived through the hole behind her TV, her heartbeat thrumming in her ears as she approached her advertising room again. She looked at her phone and could see she was early, she desperately wanted to go out and strut her stuff, but she held herself back so she could once again swim in the anticipation of what was to come. She sat outside the room, rubbing her pussy through her fine panties, squeezing her breasts and pinching her nipples, she had never felt so horny and within that horniness, a bad idea took hold.</p>
<p>Hilda unclipped her bra, letting it slide over her hands and drop to the floor. Her hands immediately went back to playing with herself at the thought of facing the world topless. Her free breasts out and swinging for anyone to see. She felt the knickers clinging to her pussy with her juices flowing so wildly. So with a lot of fumbling and clumsy rearrangement, she managed to take off her knickers around her stockings and garter.</p>
<p>Hilda's body was practically glowing with erotic humiliation. Was she really going to face freeway traffic wearing nothing but suspenders, high heels, a rabbit mask and a wig. She ran her hands over her body to silence any lingering voice of reason before stepping into the room and walking to the window where everyone could see.</p>
<p>The effect was immediate, Hilda almost caused a pileup as cars slammed on their brakes to get a look at the naked girl smiling and waving. She made sure every movement she made wiggled her hips and jiggled her tits to the delight of the passing cars. As the wordless requests started rolling in she obeyed each one without question, lusciously squeezing her breasts, spreading her labia, even bending over and spreading her cheeks to make sure the practically stopped traffic could take in every inch of her body.</p>
<p>She licked her finger and stroked her pussy, making sure everyone could see it sliding in and out of her, building up to the most humiliating orgasm with every thrust.</p>
<p>Suddenly Hilda's stupor was broken by the sight of blue flashing lights on the horizon and a vague sound of sirens approaching. She quickly darted out of the room, her frustrated disappointment matching to motorists she had suddenly abandoned.</p>
<p>"Stupid whore." Hilda admonished herself as she ran through the abandoned mall. "Cheap dumb cocksucker." The more she insulted herself the more she felt the aftershocks of arousal at the performance she had just given. She knew she could still salvage an almighty climax if she did something drastic when she got back to her house. She opened up her computer and composed a new email.</p>
<p>'Dear Lucky Rabbit Games,</p>
<p>I am so sorry, today I was a stupid bimbo. When I modelled next to your advertisement display today, my dumb horny brain forgot to put on the entire outfit you sent over. As such I also did not model for the full hour as the police were called to arrest me for being a brainless slut and I had to stop playing with my thirsty pussy long enough to flee.</p>
<p>I do not believe I have even earned the right to be a cheap whore, my smut-addled brain made me a useless cunt. As such I will be fully refunding your fee, and displaying your advert for an additional week free of charge to apologise for negotiating our contract like a functioning human and not the moronic collection of fuck-holes I actually am.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Hilda's legs were shaking so much with sexual frustration, she was barely able to open her online banking site and transfer the full fee to the marketing department before collapsing onto the floor in an almighty climax of humiliation, her fingers furiously pounding her pussy and twiddling her clit until orgasm after unbearable orgasm wiped her out.</p>
<p>Hilda had been really unlucky with her naps that weekend, as once again her twisted slumber was interrupted, this time by her doorbell going off along with some loud banging. She threw on a t-shirt and jeans and groggily answered the door to see two police officers stood outside her door.</p>
<p>"Good afternoon... Hilda" the perky female officer announced, checking her name off on a sheet. "Do you mind if we come in and have a chat?"</p>
<p>"Do you have a warrant or probable cause to enter my dwelling?" Hilda replied, having a lawyer for a dad and clientele constantly telling stories of their interactions with law enforcement made Hilda both defensive and knowledgeable about dealing with cops.</p>
<p>"No, we are just making enquiries and thought it would be more comfortable to chat inside."</p>
<p>"No, I do not consent to you entering my home. What enquiries are you making?" The older cop decided to jump in as clearly his partner's perky and non-threatening strategy wasn't going to work.</p>
<p>"There's been some criminal activity in the premises that your home is attached to. We're calling round to ask if you have seen anything suspicious or are aware of any way to secure access that you could make available to us for our investigation." He stated.</p>
<p>"Afraid not, sorry."</p>
<p>"If you would just let us have a look around your house we can rule you out of the investigation." The young partner pressed. The older officer sighed and put his head in his hands as realisation crept over Hilda's face.</p>
<p>"Am I a suspect in the crime you are investigating?" Hilda asked plainly.</p>
<p>"No, not at all, but you are a person of interest..." the perky cop awkwardly explained.</p>
<p>"Person of interest has no legal standing or obligations on my part, it just means you want to look into me even though your evidence meets no burden of proof thresholds, Why?" Hilda interrupted.</p>
<p>"Oh nothing personal, we just know the crime was committed by a caucasian woman aged 20-40, we're calling on everyone who fits that description."</p>
<p>"So this is a fishing expedition? I'm going to go ahead and invoke the fifth. I have no interest in discussing my day any further just so you can comb through it for any statement you can interpret as incriminating. Unless I am being detained or you have a warrant I have no further business with you." Hilda replied, shutting her door and immediately jumping onto her phone to watch the police walk away on her doorbell camera.</p>
<p>"You think it's her?" The rookie asked as she looked down the list for the next door to knock on.</p>
<p>"She seem like an over-eager model to you? Nah she's some punk, probably doesn't want us in there cause she's got a baggie or two of drugs lying around." The older cop observed.</p>
<p>Hilda decided she should probably cool it on the ad booth for a bit. Later that night she scrolled through her client emails and picked options that didn't require a model.</p>
<p>The next day Hilda bought some screws and brackets for her TV mount, so nobody could move it out of the way of the entrance to the mall without undoing the specific screws only Hilda knew about.</p>
<p>Hilda had calmed herself down somewhat since the full flashing incident. The social media buzz about her ad space had several companies offering to send a model to strip for cars, but Hilda turned them all down.</p>
<p>Even so, she was still able to scratch her itch by living vicariously through her past self. Some nights she would sneak into the ad space, in the shadows of night where she wouldn't be visible from the road, she would often strip down and live through whatever idle fantasy had been going through her mind that day.</p>
<p>Work was also now the calm after the frenzy, she hadn't worked the night after she had done her fully naked show, but even in the days to follow it was all the patrons could talk about. Gangs were organising their rides to go out of the way to pass the Ten Pines Mall just in case, printed photos were left taped to walls and in the toilet cubicles. After a while things returned to normal, but for Hilda the spectre of her naked body still hung over her work, an active volcano ready to erupt again at any moment.</p>
<p>One night when she was working at the Big Mike's, Hilda overheard a conversation that fired her right back up again.</p>
<p>"It's worth a shot but it ain't gonna work." A gruff voice floated across the bar.</p>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>"Well I've sent the email, just imagine if we get the space in the mall, I can get some girls together to do a photoshoot, have naked girls on my custom Harleys smiling down at the punters." One of the men in deep conversation caught Hilda listening in and beckoned her over.</p>
<p>"Hey Hilda, Derek's putting together a photoshoot for his ad at the Ten Pines Mall. You want in?" The jovial biker yelled as Hilda was deliberately picking up empty glasses nearby.</p>
<p>"The only thing I trust less than Derek with a camera, is a bike Derek has been working on. Unless charred corpse from an engine explosion is the latest hot look for models." Hilda jokingly responded.</p>
<p>"My business is booming." Derek replied. "I made enough this month that I was able to offer that sneaky ad person a grand to advertise my wares."</p>
<p>"Derek, I just did a Google search, a legal billboard in South Carolina is $1,900. You think someone breaking the law is gonna do it for a grand?"</p>
<p>"Breaking the law means it's cheaper, I doubt they're paying land rent on that thing."</p>
<p>"No way, breaking the law means they're gonna charge more. Legal billboard's don't let you put nudie girls in your ads or risk prison every time they put one up, I'd be willing to bet any amount of money you aren't getting an ad in the mall for that tiny amount."</p>
<p>"Alright I'll take that bet, If they say no, I got a grand going spare you can have, but if they say yes, you model for a photo shoot with me, you have to wear what I tell you and do the poses I want, and the best pictures will go on the banner." Hilda paused to consider the full ramifications of the opportunity that had just fallen onto her lap.</p>
<p>"They don't need that money but I sure as hell do, I'll take that bet." Hilda responded. "My conditions are: no contacting them with a higher offer, you pay up the moment they turn you down, if I do end up modeling for you, hands to yourself, photos don't go anywhere but on a banner, and nobody is getting to see my nipples or pussy. Agreed?"</p>
<p>"Agreed." Derek replied, shaking Hilda's hand.</p>
<p>Back at home, after the shift had ended, Hilda pulled up her emails and saw the request from Derek. This was quite the crossroads for her, she could turn down Derek's offer and earn $1000 to literally do nothing, or she could accept his offer and earn $1000 to squeeze into an ill fitting swimsuit and pose for Derek and his pervy friends. Remembering the deep joy she got from feeling cheap and dirty, she watched a lot of exhibitionism porn and brought herself to the edge of orgasm long enough that she ended up choosing a third option.</p>
<p>"Dear Mr. Madison." Derek triumphantly read out for the whole bar to hear while Hilda feigned surprise and disappointment at the contents of the email she drafted. "I have visited your website and I am impressed, you sell some damn fine Harleys. I'll tell you what, just because I like your style, I'll let you have a week of advertising free of charge."</p>
<p>The bar cheered at the conclusion of the bet as Hilda sighed. Welching on bets was one of the biggest no-nos among the bikers at Big Mike's. It wasn't even considered right to treat someone like they were going to welch because that was a real slur against their character. So even though no consequences were stated, Hilda knew if she wasn't a woman of her word things would go bad very quickly.</p>
<p>"Fine, where and when do you want me?"</p>
<p>"Come to my place next Wednesday at noon, also could you let me know what size bikini you wear?"</p>
<p>Hilda couldn't believe what she had signed herself up for as she pulled into Derek's Harley Davidson dealership and garage. Laid out in front of the shop, several of his best bikes were already cleaned, polished, and waiting for her to debase herself on them. This was way different to before, sure she could blame the lost bet, but she couldn't hide who she was. Not only was Derek a regular but the banner was going to be put on a common route for bikers who frequented the bar. Before she had been exposing only her body, now she was about to expose herself, and she had effectively paid $1000 for the privilege.</p>
<p>Derek had a supremely smug look on his face as he saw Hilda approaching. He showed her to his office where he had her outfit laid out on his desk. It was a skimpy tiger print two piece bikini, made almost entirely of string except the triangular cups of the bra and the small triangle at the front of the thong.</p>
<p>"Where's the rest of it?" Hilda incredulously asked, partially out of hesitation, partly to make sure she didn't look too eager.</p>
<p>"You seen what motorbike models are usually working with? This is conservative." Derek replied as he left the room to give Hilda privacy to change.</p>
<p>Hilda had the outfit on surprisingly quickly, but then spent some time in the office looking herself up and down, admiring her body in the skimpy bikini, shaved for the occasion and with early signs of success from her recently introduced exercise regime. She ran her hands over herself and then jumped as there was a loud knocking on the door.</p>
<p>"Come on Hilda, time is money." Derek yelled. Hilda was confident she had hesitated long enough to show resistance and slowly walked out of Derek's office.</p>
<p>Hilda felt a genuine blush flow over her body as Derek clamped eyes on her and a grin spread across his face.</p>
<p>"Not bad, I've seen better but I'll give it a pass as it's you." Said Derek. Hilda once again found herself holding her tongue rather than attacking him back as the occasion merited. "No comeback? Alright then, let's start with you lying in the sun next to the engine parts."</p>
<p>Derek was surprised at Hilda's complete compliance. Here was a woman who once spent a night calling him girls names and only serving him sparkling white wine because he asked when the toilets would be fixed, and now he was ordering her to push her tits together or bend over a motorbike seductively and she was doing so without question. Even more off-putting was the wide grin she kept on her face throughout the whole process.</p>
<p>Very quickly Derek's camera filled with smutty images of the previously intimidating bartender. The curves of her bottom, the breasts spilling out around the skimpy bra, every inch of flesh was contorted and posed across a variety of products without any resistance. Derek had thought of a deviant idea that the terms of his bet would let him do and was on the fence about doing it, but Hilda's happy complicity took away any doubt he should go for it.</p>
<p>"Alright last set of pictures now." Derek announced, moving Hilda over to his personal motorbike, cleaned to a sparkling shine for its media debut. "For this photo, you are going to be riding this hog without the bikini."</p>
<p>"Get fucked." Hilda replied, the extremity of his request knocking her out of her stupor. "The bet was that my nipples and pussy stay behind fabric."</p>
<p>"The bet was that nobody can see your nipples and pussy. I'm going to angle the camera and you're going to pose in such a way that they won't be in the photo, they'll be hidden by the bike, but it will be clear that you are naked. The bet also was that you would wear what I want and do the poses I tell you." Derek explained. Hilda stood for a moment and fumed that Derek had tricked her, her anger swirling with the lust that had been building inside her throughout the photography session.</p>
<p>Hilda shivered, which Derek took as humiliation but Hilda knew was actually anticipation, deep down she actually was glad Derek had tricked her. Being tricked into being a sex object was exactly the sort of thing stupid whores do and she was delighting in being the stupid whore this moment needed. At no point taking her eyes off Derek, she pulled the drawstring on her bra and let it drop to the floor, then she pulled her knickers down and stepped out of them.</p>
<p>"Alright where do you want me?" She said emotionlessly as Derek's eyes popped out of his skull. After a significant time staring the bartender up and down, Derek gestured her over to the motorbike and had her straddling the warm seat. He instructed Hilda to lean forward so her naked body was caressing the curves of his machine, then the camera clicked with acknowledgement that the moment had been captured.</p>
<p>Next Derek had had Hilda slowly lift herself up, her body peeling away from the hot metal, he was getting pictures that captured her breasts hanging as far as they could while her nipples remained hidden as they pressed against the chrome.</p>
<p>Next Derek had her sit up straight and hold onto the high rise handlebars. He took the photo front on, adjusting the angle and distance until the photo was perfectly placed to have the handlebars just covering Hilda's nipples and the angle of the seat covering her pussy.</p>
<p>Finally Derek had Hilda get off the motorcycle, and had her bend over facing away from him, her breasts hidden by the angle of her body but her uncovered ass featuring as the centrepiece of the shot.</p>
<p>Eventually, once Derek had stretched his credulity far enough, he announced that the shoot was over. Hilda swooned then straightened herself up, she had been keeping herself together for the photo shoot but had to admit she was hornier than she had ever been.</p>
<p>"So I'm guessing there's a lot of pictures of me that won't make the advert but you'll be keeping for your spank bank then?" Hilda accused, approaching Derek maliciously.</p>
<p>"I'll delete them."</p>
<p>"Oh I don't believe that for a second." Hilda mocked. "I want you to keep them, you can't share them without everyone knowing you don't keep your end of a bargain." Derek knew this was true, by was still intimidated by how Hilda was now right next to him with an intense look on her face.</p>
<p>Hilda grabbed Derek by the hand and slowly ran it up her body, she gave him plenty of time to glide over her smooth pussy, then moved it higher and cupped it around her breast, letting him give it a squeeze. She then leant in, so she was whispering directly into his ear while she moved Derek's hand onto her bottom.</p>
<p>"I had fun today, but you will never get me in a position like this again. And if you tell anyone, they sure as shit won't believe you."</p>
<p>Hilda then turned and immediately walked away, leaving Derek with an erection and a confused look on his face.</p>
<p>The day Hilda received the banner ad for Derek's garage, she unfurled it over her bedroom wall. It was unmistakably her, posing and degrading herself, firstly in a skimpy bikini and then her naked body stretched over chrome and leather. She barely got any sleep that night and was in the room setting up the banner the moment the previous ad slot had been completed.</p>
<p>Once the banner had been unfurled and Hilda's naked body was looking down at the road, she crouched behind the banner and masturbated furiously at the thought of people seeing her naked over the next week. When she drove past it she saw her naked body as thousands of other drivers would and she pulled off at the next turning so she could finger herself in her car. For the next couple of days she could barely function as every reminder of the banner sent her spiralling with lust that demanded release.</p>
<p>By the time Hilda had arrived for her next shift at the Big Mike's, the whole place was humming with news of her modeling debut. Derek had indeed kept the more revealing pictures to himself and played down how into being photographed Hilda was. But he was still the man of the hour having gotten the pictures of Hilda, and having been given the gift of seeing her naked (something a lot of regulars had a lot of questions about). Hilda issued a declaration that anyone who talked to her about the banner would be roughly introduced to the dumpster out back with an intensity that was able to silence even the hardiest of bikers. So the rest of the week was simply whispers in Hilda's direction and then some intense pint staring any time she gave them her death glare.</p>
<p>Part way through the week Hilda got another knock on the door from the police. Her appearance on the banner had moved her from "person of interest" to "suspect". But Hilda was able to account for how she ended up on the banner, Derek corroborated her story, and she was able to channel such rage about the situation that the police believed it was just a horrible coincidence.</p>
<p>Her dad called later that week, he never called without an agenda, but spoke broadly about what she was doing for money and if she needed any financial help. Hilda could tell her ad had come to his attention and that he didn't want to deal with it, so she told him that the bar was paying her well enough and that she had recently gotten some lucrative freelance work in marketing consultancy. Once it became clear that their hidden agendas had been satisfied they both made their excuses and hung up.</p>
<p>Once the advert came down, Hilda kept it as long as she could before Derek's insistent emails forced her to send it back to him. She knew he wanted that banner for his shop but she secretly suspected it may end up being displayed around Big Mike's occasionally. Hilda found her love of being degraded fluctuated, and that although it was fun in the moment, it was exhausting long term to cover her dignity and turn her anger up to 11 to save face. She wanted to be a cheap whore again, but in a way she could walk away from like with the gambling advert.</p>
<p>Lucky Rabbit Games had contacted her a couple of times since, her emails were confusing but they couldn't argue with the publicity she generated for them free of charge. But their ideas were never quite right, and it didn't help that the local police seemed to be sniffing around any time they were in the area, more for the titillation than the pressure to solve the crime as none of the requests to demolish part of the mall to get inside had been agreed.</p>
<p>It was then that the stars aligned for Hilda. Firstly she had an offer she couldn't say no to. The company was called LiveJerk and they did online cam shows. They wanted one of their models to do a live cam show from the room. Hilda was steadfast in her "no outside access" rule but intrigued at her immediate future.</p>
<p>Her second piece of luck was the timing, if she did a live cam show the police would of course be coming down hard, but she posited that if she did her stint on the 4th of July weekend, then the police would be too busy with nearby parade security and illegal fireworks shows to have the manpower to do anything about her act.</p>
<p>Finally, just as she was on the fence about whether or not to go through with this, Big Mike gave her the late shift the day they wanted her to perform, so she would have time to do this and then her show would be the talk of the bar for the night.</p>
<p>Hilda emailed the porn site back with her proposal, and some photos of herself to assure them she was the right person for the job. That email became a fruitful conversation that yielded a plan even the porn site felt was a bit crazy, but were willing to give a shot.</p>
<p>The banner ad the cam show site had sent over met specifications. It was a series of models, scantily clad but still covered enough to keep the police from busting in. On the far left of the banner was a metal frame holding up a large curtain covering up the area that Hilda had agreed to perform in and all the equipment waiting for her.</p>
<p>She spent a long time in the area, staring at the variety of cameras, the laptop that controlled the stream, and checking her phone for the proposed start time that had been circulating on the website for a while now, but cryptically worded as a 1 hour special event. She prepared and re-prepared until all that was left was to will the clock to move faster for her wildest outing yet.</p>
<p>Hilda was dressed in an outfit she felt screamed "cheap whore." A red thong worn under a red pleated skirt that barely qualified as a belt. She was not wearing a bra but had instead settled for a bright pink tight spaghetti strap crop top with fabric so fine her nipples were clearly visible. All clothing on her didn't cost much and thus was made of unmistakably cheap material. She had chosen a bleach blonde wig that cascaded over her shoulders in luscious curls, and large mirrored sunglasses. She had also used enough makeup that she was basically drawing a new face on her own, and her new face had the thickest cherry lips, artificially smooth skin and a single beauty spot that screamed that all she wanted was sex.</p>
<p>Eventually Hilda was able to see her timer count down to zero and so she snuck out to the room and used the laptop to turn on the cameras one by one. She eased the remote control egg they had sent inside her pussy, moaning at the thought that soon others would be controlling her orgasm. Her hand hovered for a moment over the button to launch the stream, drinking in the situation and number of people soon to be watching her degrade herself according to her deviant designs.</p>
<p>*Click*</p>
<p>The stream was live and Hilda watched as people began to comment on her body and leer with suggestions of what would happen next. Some even recognised her location and started sharing with everyone where the show was taking place. Slowly people started to read through the rules Hilda had written and general lust became focused desire.</p>
<p>'Tip game:</p>
<p>Every time I receive a tip of $10 the vibrator in my pussy will go off for thirty seconds.</p>
<p>For every $100 I get, I will spin the punishment wheel once.'</p>
<p>The punishment wheel was a wooden spinner that a camera was focussed on. It was mostly evenly divided into colour coded sections, but the black section was significantly smaller than the others. The key was posted on the livestream.</p>
<p>Red: Fully open the curtain for 1 minute.</p>
<p>Orange: take off your top.</p>
<p>Yellow: take off your skirt.</p>
<p>Green: Ram a dildo down your throat until you gag.</p>
<p>Blue: Write an insult on your body.</p>
<p>Purple: take off your panties.</p>
<p>Pink: Refund all the tips you have received so far.</p>
<p>Black: All of the above.</p>
<p>"In case you're wondering." Hilda announced with a higher pitched voice that she hoped was enough to disguise herself. "Punishments are likely to change over time. Some are one use only and will immediately be replaced, others will get worse if the wheel lands on them three times."</p>
<p>Almost immediately Hilda felt the egg in her pussy spring to life, she made sure to give her audience a thick moan of delight.</p>
<p>"Thank you, let me stick my face out of the curtain, let some of the motorists see my o face." Hilda stuttered through the vibrations. She stuck her face through the curtain and felt her pussy grow warm as the cars below zoomed about their day. There was a camera facing the curtain so her viewers could see her goofy face, there was also one camera behind the curtain that got a look directly up her skirt when she bent over to look out over the road.</p>
<p>After a bit of time she moved back inside the curtain to look at her tips. Her pussy had been vibrating non-stop and she had actually made $100 already.</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry everyone, I was so busy showing the road how I look when my pussy makes me dumber, I didn't realise I needed to spin the wheel. Alright here it goes."</p>
<p>Hilda reached over and spun the wheel, it made a clicking sound as the pointer skipped over each peg, eventually settling on orange. Hilda giggled as she peeled her top up, letting her breasts rise up with the fabric then bounce out. She struggled and eventually managed the difficult task of taking off her top without it catching on her sunglasses or wig, all the while shuddering and jerking at the sporadic vibrations assaulting her pussy. She let the camera get a good look at her tits while an unseen tech person changed the colour key so yellow now read "attach nipple clips for 1 minute." She then checked her tip pot and spun the wheel again the moment it tipped over $200, watching as this time it jutted to a halt on pink.</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Hilda bit her lip as she watched her tip jar drop back down to $0. People in the chat room then started going wild as they confirmed they were getting their money refunded.</p>
<p>"Does it make you happy knowing I may end up not getting paid? Just degrading myself for your pleasure and getting nothing in return?" Hilda moaned at the camera, the people in the chat room were very much in agreement.</p>
<p>With their money refunded, most people in the chat immediately reinvested and pretty much straight away Hilda was spinning the wheel again, moaning at the humiliations to come and the non-stop vibration in her pussy. The wheel clicked to a stop on blue, so Hilda picked up a pen she had prepared for the situation and wrote "cheap whore" in shaky letters across her tits while the vibrator relentlessly reminded her of the attention she was getting. By the time she had finished writing on herself the tip jar was already up by $300, she was struggling to keep up with her punishment obligations so squealed as she spun the wheel again, watching it stop on red.</p>
<p>Hilda surprised herself with her lack of hesitation as she threw the curtain to one side and sunlight flooded her streaming area. She let out a giggle that the cars could see her breasts and cheap thong, then let out a much heartier laugh at the thought of what they were going to see when she spun the wheel again and it landed on purple.</p>
<p>"Should I face the camera as I take off my panties? Or should I face the road?" Hilda performatively asked with a mischievous grin. She stood out and walked beyond the curtain, watching the cars slow beneath her as she peeled her thong down her legs and tossed it to one side. As she posed next to the road, the degradation, the sluttiness, the vibrations in her pussy all became too much and swirled together into a loudly moaning orgasm as she leant against the window. After a moment to compose herself she came back to her performance area and closed the curtain as the minute was up. The tip jar was now up to over $500, She was overdue two spins on the wheel with her time wasting, wondering if she could be quick enough to keep up. She gave the wheel a weaker spin hoping to speed up the process, while the key updated so purple now read "put in the remote activated butt plug."</p>
<p>The spinner landed on blue and Hilda hurriedly wrote 'slut' across her pubis before quickly spinning the wheel again. She could see several comments in the chat room of people trying to drive over to her location and wanted to be in a position to give them a good show. The wheel whirred around to orange and Hilda picked up the clips specially prepared for the situation.</p>
<p>At first she felt like putting them on as quickly as possible, but as the first clip contracted around her nipples, she squealed with pain. She had agreed to this having never tried nipple clips before and found she wasn't as masochistic as she first thought. Nevertheless she had promised her viewers she would do it and what kind of cheap whore would she be if she said no? She attached the other clip and looked intensely at her timer, the upshot was that the vibrations in her pussy were no longer driving her to immediate distraction. She gave the camera a nice view of her punished nipples before noticing her tip jar had surpassed $600 and spinning the wheel again.</p>
<p>Hilda was slightly disappointed to see yellow come up, at this point the skirt was a mere accessory, taking it off didn't make her any more humiliated. She tossed it to one side and felt some joy well up in her that not only could she now take off the nipple clips, but the tips were still coming thick and fast, at $800 she was now 2 spins behind.</p>
<p>The clicking stopped as the spinner landed on pink again and the tip jar reset itself to $0, there was a slight pause as the system reset itself but then the egg sprung back into life as tips started rolling in, mostly people giving back the money they had just refunded. She moaned with glee as the tips pretty much immediately surpassed $100 and she got to spin the wheel again.</p>
<p>"Pink again?" Hilda yelled. "This thing must be rigged?" The growing pot of tips once again reset to $0, but suddenly the chat room noticed that the text on the key for pink had changed, it now read 'refund all the tips you have so far and give one random user 50% of your tips at the end of the stream.'</p>
<p>"You know what this means, one of you out there could become my pimp, taking a cut of the money I make selling my slutty body." Hilda explained, her voice wavering as the vibrations in her pussy resumed with the latest round of tips coming in fast. Hilda flashed a grin the moment her tip pot commanded her to spin the wheel again.</p>
<p>"Green, that's good, I was wondering when I would get to show off my gag reflex" Hilda announced, grabbing her specially prepared dildo and using her right hand to push it down her throat while she spun the wheel again with her left hand for efficiency's sake. The clicking of wheel combined with the gagging retch as Hilda pushed the dildo past the point that was comfortable provided a degrading soundscape for her to turn to one side to see where the wheel had landed.</p>
<p>The wheel had barely stopped moving on red when Hilda used her free hand to whip open the curtain, still holding the dildo at the back of her throat for a bit longer, imagining the scene she had just presented of herself for passing traffic. She didn't even bother looking at the tip jar, she just spun the wheel again on instinct as she took the dildo out of her throat.</p>
<p>"What luck, purple just as the curtain is open. Let's give them a show shall we?" Hilda grabbed the buttplug, already feeling it vibrating in her hand with each tip that came in. She smeared some lube on it, then turned around so the cars below could get a good view of her easing the plug inside her bottom. Slowly and carefully as it was her first time with anal play.</p>
<p>Unlike with the nipple clamps, the buttplug was a pleasant surprise, feeling the vibrations syncing up between the egg in her pussy and her newly filled anus was a great feeling for Hilda. As she did this the board updated so purple now read 'thrust the butt plug in and out of you five times'. She paused for a moment to fully feel the embarrassing violation by her cam viewers and the drivers below before returning to spin the wheel again.</p>
<p>"Red, that's good, I didn't feel like closing the curtain anyway." Hilda explained as the countdown timer on the curtain reset, and the key for red updated so the new task read 'open the curtain permanently'.</p>
<p>Hilda noticed that some people had actually started to arrive to watch her in person, there were a couple of men who had pulled over to the hard shoulder and were waving to her, and one in the chat room who insisted he was going to try and find a way into the mall so he could be part of the show. Hilda gave the spectators a wave before spinning the wheel again.</p>
<p>"Pink! Looks like I've become an even cheaper whore. Doesn't it make your cocks hard to think that right now I could be degrading myself to earn money for you?" Hilda thought aloud, distracting herself from the latest update to pink which now read 'refund all the tips you have so far and give one random user 100% of your tips at the end of the stream.' she gave the wheel one more spin before it would be time to close the curtains and watched as it clicked around to its inevitable destination.</p>
<p>"Shit..." Hilda exclaimed watching as the tiny slither of black moved under the pointer and all momentum left the wheel. "Alright let's do this one thing at a time then we'll update the board and get back to the game."</p>
<p>Hilda started by knocking over the whole apparatus holding up the curtain, dramatically removing any sort of barrier between her and the road. She wanted to put the nipple clips on slowly but she knew she had to hurry so she just ignored the sudden jolting pain in her nipples in order to keep going. For the sake of speed she combined the next two punishments, using one hand to shove a dildo down her throat while spanking herself with the other. She groaned and gagged and regretted all the painful punishments she had suggested as this experience has taught her she wanted to be humiliated not hurt.</p>
<p>She grabbed the pen and contorted herself in such a way that she could messily write 'anal bitch' on the small of her back while she pushed and pulled the buttplug, punishing her poor hole. The slight pain of inexperienced anal starting to overtake the wonderous vibrations in the battle for Hilda's mind. She took a moment so that everyone could acknowledge the updated board of punishments.</p>
<p>Red: call a random contact on your phone until they hang up on you.</p>
<p>Orange: attach nipple clips for the rest of the show.</p>
<p>Yellow: spank yourself 5 times.</p>
<p>Green: ram a dildo down your throat until you gag.</p>
<p>Blue: write an insult on your face</p>
<p>Purple: thrust the butt plug in and out of you five times</p>
<p>Pink: give a random user 150% of the tips at the end of the stream.</p>
<p>Black: all of the above.</p>
<p>"So I just went from being a cheap whore to a slave. I won't be earning any money from this degrading fuck show, and if I roll pink again I'll be paying for the privilege of being a public fuck toy. That must turn you on, it's definitely turning me on so much." Hilda moaned, her hand darting to her pussy to play with her clit as the vibrations and humiliations overwhelmed her and her audience got to watch as she succumbed to another screaming orgasm.</p>
<p>"Five minutes left. Just to be clear, in five minutes the tip jar is turned off, the stream doesn't end until I have done all the punishment spins that the tips demand." Hilda spun the wheel and then took a moment to once again wave at the gridlocked traffic and gathering audience made of a mix of horny bystanders and people who drove straight over after they recognised the location of the livestream.</p>
<p>The clicking subsided and Hilda saw that Blue had come up. She wordlessly got the pen and wrote 'cunt' on her cheek, hoping that the writing would come off with the thick layer of makeup before her shift at Big Mike's later that day. The tips were coming in hard with her announcement that the stream would not end until her punishments were done, and now the tip jar would not be brought back down to 0 on the wheel showing pink, Hilda began to swoon at the task ahead of her. She spun the wheel again. Hilda let out an almighty groan of humiliation, the spinner had come up pink.</p>
<p>"This must be rigged." Hilda moaned. "Well now I'm not just a free slut, I'm actually going to pay for the privilege of degrading myself." Just as she finished explaining she heard a loud beep coming from the computer which signified the end of her time, she then looked at the tip jar with $770 in it, doing some quick calculations in her head she looked at the camera and announced, "So I still have to spin the wheel 5 more times before I'm done. As it stands I will be giving one user $335 dollars from my own money, but it could be worse than that."</p>
<p>The board updated and pink now read 'give a random user 200% of your tips.' Hilda paused for a second and then spun the wheel again, watching it roll around until it clicked to a stop on blue.</p>
<p>"I swear this thing must be weighted towards blue, red and pink." Hilda exclaimed, taking out her pen and writing 'slut' on her other cheek. "Alright 4 more spins."</p>
<p>Hilda spun the wheel, then checked up on her roadside audience. The gridlocked traffic meant no new cars were getting through, but a swarm of bikers had shown up, weaving through the traffic to get a good look at Hilda's degradation. She recognised pretty much every regular from Big Mike's in the mix, someone must have seen her stream, told the bar and mustered them all to move out to get a live view of the show. Hilda chuckled and waved as she turned her attention back to the spinning wheel that had just landed on pink.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, I'm now paying someone $770 for the privilege of being a filthy whore." Hilda noted. "This is so hot, can whoever's doing the tech on this just turn the vibrations back on in my egg and plug?" She asked. She needed the distraction, she had deliberately put unthinkable things on the wheel for if she rolled something more than six times, thinking it would never go that far and being incredibly turned on at the time. As the vibrations started up again, no longer coming and going with the waves of tips, just one steady relentless pulse, Hilda watched the text for the pink section get updated to. 'give a random user 200% of your tips and all of your underwear.' Hilda shuddered as she spun the wheel again, at least happy that it came up green.</p>
<p>Hilda looked out over her audience who were now cheering and clapping with every humiliation she put herself through. She tried to make eye contact with each and every one of them as she thrust a dildo down her throat, filling her microphones with choking and gagging, her humiliation a swirl coalescing around the intense vibrations assaulting her pussy and anus.</p>
<p>"Two more spins!" Hilda announced gasping for air as the green slot updated to read 'shove your buttplug so far down your throat that you gag.' She gave the spinner a hard spin, knowing time was no longer of the essence and giving the audience a quick degrading twirl as she did so. She turned back to see the spinner had landed on purple.</p>
<p>The audience below stretched far and wide, even traffic going in the other direction had stopped to take in the show. Hilda turned her ass towards the road as she began to thrust the buttplug in and out of herself. The punishment said she only had to do it five times, but she was so close to an incredible degrading orgasm that she kept going until her legs began to shake and she collapsed in a heap of screams and shudders that seemed to bathe her in pleasure as the world gathered at her feet. Eventually Hilda got up and looked out over the road, cars were starting to move along as the blue flashing lights approached over the horizon.</p>
<p>"One more spin, better do it quickly as the police are here." Hilda announced spinning the wheel. It landed on pink and a frown crawled across Hilda's face. "oh no, that's pretty embarrassing for me but it's a boring end to a stream. How about I round up my tip jar and give the wheel one more spin?" Her viewers were on board for that, even before they saw pink update to read 'give a random user 500% of your tips and all of your clothes.'</p>
<p>Hilda began furiously fingering her clitoris as she spun the wheel again, she was determined to finish with an orgasm. The board clicked around again and some of the less brave bikers started moving on lest they get caught in the approaching police's wrath. Hilda sighed that her show was coming to an end then turned to see that the wheel had just spun round to blue.</p>
<p>"I can work with that." Hilda replied, taking the pen in her left hand so she could continue fingering herself with her right. She closed her eyes so she could swim in the sensations of vibrations, clit-flicking, and the slow relentless rub of a pen nib gliding over her cheek and chin, drawing the largest crudest cock she could pointing at her mouth. She briefly opened her eyes to see that the police were now in view, they were looking right at her as she screamed and bucked against her wild desire.</p>
<p>Hilda took a deep breath, then got to work very quickly collecting up all her sex toys and streaming equipment into a nearby bag, not caring if she damaged any of it. She dived back through the door and ran to her apartment, immediately diving in the shower in the hope that the writing on her face would be gone by the time the police knocked on her door.</p>
<p>Hilda let out a deep and depressed sigh. It had been a couple of months since her legendary fourth of July show and as much as she had enjoyed it at the time, the fallout made it very clear she had gone too far.</p>
<p>The police had finally gotten enough evidence to convince their superiors that they needed to forcefully enter the mall and close up the door to the ad space. Not only was there a big gaping hole where one of the walls used to be, but the police had cut off Hilda's locks and replaced them with their own. There was eventually another round of questioning but Hilda acted appropriately disgusted as she said "no comment" and their search of the apartment found no obvious entrance to the mall so they left with 'just FYI' threats that indecent exposure carried a misdemeanor charge and three years in prison.</p>
<p>Just to be on the safe side Hilda stopped replying to ad requests, in case the police tried to find her that way and instead went back to her humdrum life as a bartender. For a while she enjoyed going to work commando as she had mailed all her underwear to a stranger in Vermont, but the guys at Big Mike's quickly noticed the way her breasts swayed and bounced uncontained by a bra and it became clear she needed to buy new support to get her work done unharassed.</p>
<p>Outside of her work she had become more isolated, despite her freebies she had actually earned quite a lot from her little advertising venture, but with nothing to spend it on her bank balance became another relic of the few months of having a passion. She thought about quitting bartending, her regulars had certainly noticed her whole new level of withering rage she brought to anyone who stepped out of line, but without the routine human contact of that job Hilda wondered how deep her depression would really go.</p>
<p>"This is a great idea, either she needs to lighten up or she needs to be taken down a peg, either way this is the way to do it."</p>
<p>"She will murder us, all of us, one at a time and slowly."</p>
<p>"She'll seem angry, but I reckon she'll come to appreciate it." Derek replied with a grin. He had a hunch this plan would work out for everyone.</p>
<p>Hilda pulled up to Big Mike's in another rotten mood, before her shift her father had called her with another pointed chat about her wasting her life working as a bartender. Hilda agreed but while he wanted her to get a new and more respectable job, Hilda wanted her old disreputable one back. The bikers outside the bar saw Hilda pulling up and all of a sudden had a deep interest in whatever innocuous part of their bikes they felt could draw their eye. Hilda heard their whispers and wondered what strange thing was going on today. As she opened the door to the bar she got her answer.</p>
<p>Hung behind the bar, draped over the pool tables, and covering every wall they could were banners covered with photos from her photo session with Derek. Every pose and contortion was enlarged and placed where the whole bar could see. Hilda scowled, her fury so palpable nobody even laughed (although they all found it hilarious.) She scanned the bar and found Derek sat in the corner with a smug grin on his face.</p>
<p>"I knew you were a bunch of shitty things, but I never figured you for a welch." Hilda snarled. The atmosphere of Big Mike's immediately changed at the most ugly slur that could be used in those circles.</p>
<p>"Your terms were your photos could only be used on a banner, these are all banners." He explained.</p>
<p>"Get out of the bar now and take all your banners with you." Hilda ordered.</p>
<p>"Can't kick out everyone, and we all agreed the banners stay until you explain why you've been so angry recently."</p>
<p>"I'm angry because fifty or so years ago your mum tripped and landed pussy first on the dickhead fairy and now I have to deal with you." Hilda explained, her voice already beginning to soften at her ubiquitous flesh always within her range of vision.</p>
<p>"Good one, but you've been a right bitch recently and the guys wanted you to lighten up." He continued to explain.</p>
<p>"Yeah, whenever I want someone to calm down I remind them of the humiliating bet they lost. Why did Buddha even bother with that meditation schtick, he could have just surrounded himself with goading pricks." Hilda retorted, seeing that the customers were not budging on this. "Alright fine, I can't kick you but I can do a shitty job. Until the banners are taken down, nobody in this bar is getting what they ordered, none of the glasses will be clean, and you have all agreed to any change you have going straight into the tip jar."</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<p>Hilda stormed behind the bar as the bikers laughed and rolled with her ultimatum. She began charging people for beers, then giving them a glass of ice, everyone one of Derek's orders miraculously was changed to a shot of spit, even when she did feel like serving alcohol it was the oldest stuff she could find where she had to brush the dust if the lid just to get the bottle open. The whole time the façade of her anger became weaker as she swum in a reminder of her former life of humiliation.</p>
<p>"Pint of beer please, Hilda." Derek requested. Hilda gave him a wine glass filled with bar nuts, lemon juice and Irish cream. "You know the moment you lighten up the banners come down right?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I didn't realise you just wanted me to lighten up. I mean if you wanted a smile on my face all you had to do was ask... and take the banners down... and kill yourself." Hilda snarled.</p>
<p>"How about another wager? That's how you ended up on the banner, maybe that's how you can come off it." Those words caught the attention of the bar while Hilda considered it. "We want you to lighten up, so how about you smile? If you can smile for one hour I'll take these banners back to my place and burn them, I'll even let you delete the pictures off my computer so I can't make more."</p>
<p>"What's the downside?" Hilda sceptically asked.</p>
<p>"If at any point you stop smiling or raise your voice at us, tomorrow you do your shift wearing that outfit from the photoshoot." Hilda thought this bet through, she thought about once again exposing herself, not as an anonymous blonde but as herself for everyone to see, she even noticed the obvious trap that Derek had laid for her in the way he phrased her punishment and didn't care. Hilda once again felt a spark of a long lost thrill and agreed.</p>
<p>"Fine, I'll smile for the next hour and you destroy the banners and all the photos from my photoshoot. Ground rules: I am allowed to stop smiling to deal with people breaking bar rules, so no starting a fight, trying to steal, that sort of stuff. Me not smiling will have to be confirmed by the bar's CCTV, don't worry I will stay in view of it. If I win the banners are destroyed and the photos deleted tonight, no waiting around. If I lose..." Hilda took a deep breath at the thought of it, "no photos, no videos, no touching, and the CCTV gets deleted at the end of the night."</p>
<p>"Alright, also if I win you have to bartend to the best of your ability while in the outfit, no skulking behind the bar or being mean to us." Derek replied shaking Hilda's hand. Hilda immediately plastered a smile across her face.</p>
<p>"It's now 10:17, at 11:17 the bet is over." She cheerily announced. "Now get the fuck out of my face, I have people to serve."</p>
<p>Hilda spent the next hour deeply unnerving some of her regular customers, her face, her tone, even her mannerisms were of someone happy. But the words she said and the actions she took were still that of someone full of rage and wrath. Similarly everyone willing her to fail the bet was doing whatever they could to wind her up. Some asked her about how she was going to feel with a whole bar staring at her tits, some took the time to remind her of the photoshoot that got her in this situation, some even goaded that there was no way she was going to emerge from this with her dignity intact. They had no idea that such comments were actually helping Hilda keep a smile on her face.</p>
<p>Hilda had considered giving the bet her all, maybe even winning just to prove a point. But knowing what was ahead of her if she failed, there was no way she could live with letting an opportunity like this slip her by. She looked at the clock and saw the time slipping away, if she was going to fail this task she had to find a believable way to do it soon.</p>
<p>Her whole body thrummed as she had an idea, her legs already seemed weak and seemed to go into slow motion as she deliberately stepped on an errant ice cube on the floor behind the bar. Her foot immediately slipped out from under herself and she felt the world tumble around her as she fell to the floor.</p>
<p>"Ahh, motherfucker." Hilda angrily yelled.</p>
<p>"Well I don't know about you fellas, but I reckon that don't look like a big smile on Hilda's face." Derek announced to the bar.</p>
<p>"Oh come on Derek, I just ate shit behind the bar, surely that doesn't count."</p>
<p>"Don't remember there being a shit eating exemption. Looks like you got a new work uniform for tomorrow." Derek explained with a big grin on his face. Hilda met his eyes and for a moment they shared an understanding that they both knew that there was no other way this could have turned out.</p>
<p>Hilda sat in her car outside Big Mike's, she could see every parking space full of motorbikes, word of her lost bet had clearly spread like wildfire. She took a deep breath to calm her raging heartbeat and got out of the car.</p>
<p>The bar erupted into cheers as she entered, she did her best angrily ignoring act, and walked up to Derek to say what she knew she had to say to feign victimhood.</p>
<p>"Alright I'm here, where's the bikini?" She saw Derek's grin widen and she knew she had just sprung his incredibly obvious trap, but nonetheless had to act surprised.</p>
<p>"Why would I bring that?"</p>
<p>"Because I lost the bet last night and now I have to bartend in it, I know you just got a pile of cockroaches where your brain should be but I would have thought you would remember our bet."</p>
<p>"The bet was that if you lost you had to do a shift wearing the same outfit you wore during the photoshoot." He explained walking over to the banner. "As we never specified which one I figured it was dealer's choice, so I choose that you wear the outfit in this photo." He pointed at one of the photos of Hilda stark naked, her parts only covered by the proximity of a motorbike.</p>
<p>"That's not what we meant and you know it!" Hilda yelled performatively.</p>
<p>"Hilda Grimsdottir, you're not a welch are you?" Derek asked accusingly, knowing those exact words and the reactions it spurred from a bar full of bikers would silence any thoughts of disobedience. Hilda walked behind the bar, poured herself a shot of whiskey to calm her nerves, then began stripping off her clothes as the bar cheered her on.</p>
<p>The top came off pretty easily, letting everyone get a view of her black bra. Next were her trousers, she enjoyed letting the patrons get in a mocking laugh at her for struggling to take them off while she still had her shoes and socks on. Eventually the whole mess of clothes and footwear formed a pile on the floor as Hilda faced the bar in her bra and kickers. The bar began to chant 'off, off, off' while Hilda shuddered and hesitated.</p>
<p>She was at the threshold of a degrading exposure, hesitation was part of the act but it was also a chance to savour the moment. Hilda unclipped her bra, then copying a move from her stream she lifted it up, letting the fabric raise up her breasts before releasing them so they bounced out. As the cheers rose she bent behind the bar, drawing her audience to lean closer to try and look over the taps and glasses as she pulled down her knickers, then rose up again to show the bar her total glory.</p>
<p>"Alright, which of you dirty pervs wants a drink!" She yelled. Derek, being good to his word, quickly jumped behind the bar to use the chalkboard to write the pre-approved ground rules, 'no photos, no videos, no touching.'</p>
<p>Hilda grasped the tap firmly to control her shaking hands with each pint she pulled. Each biker who came to the bar looked her up and down and she shuddered in the totality of her exposure. Every shift from now on she would be serving people who she knew had seen her totally naked, who knew she knew they had seen her naked. She was totally at their mercy, showing herself off for their entertainment, degrading herself and getting nothing in return.</p>
<p>Derek was obviously the man of the hour, for the rest of the night he didn't have to buy a drink or lift a finger. Every so often Hilda would have to wander the bar, collecting up the empty glasses and giving everyone an unfettered view of her naked body, and when she did so she would give Derek the most withering glare she could manage while deep down thanking him for making this happen.</p>
<p>"...and a pint for Derek, he got you good Hilda." A large biker drooled while unashamedly staring at her breasts.</p>
<p>"He didn't get me good, I slipped on an ice cube and then he cheated." Hilda huffed in the same way she had huffed for everyone else at the bar that night.</p>
<p>"You fucked up and now everyone's staring at you tits. Although don't think it has gone unnoticed that you shave yourself down there."</p>
<p>"Well I thought I was going to be wearing a skimpy bikini and didn't want to embarrass myself." Hilda explained, lying on both accounts.</p>
<p>"Well, you get a nice tip from me nonetheless. Let me know if you want to earn some more on top of that." He carried away his beers and gave Hilda a wink as she shuddered at the thought of letting him have his way with her.</p>
<p>"Two beers and a bottle of coke please Hilda." The next biker requested. Early on the bikers had noticed that the coke was in the fridge at the back of the bar, and so for Hilda to reach it she had to turn away from them and bend over. After that realisation a lot of bottles of coke were being added to orders. Hilda pulled two taps of beer to run then turned her back and bent over so the man could watch her debase herself just for a coke. "Nice, you should do this more often."</p>
<p>"If it wasn't for that fucking ice cube I wouldn't have to show an inch of flesh in this place."</p>
<p>"Whatever torpedo tits. You know what, make that two bottles of coke."</p>
<p>It would be a couple of hours of non-stop demeaning comments and degrading exposure before Derek deigned to return to the bar to see how Hilda was doing.</p>
<p>"Hey dickhead, enjoying your luck."</p>
<p>"Every drop of it." Derek replied with a big smile.</p>
<p>"You know only shitty people have good luck. That's a fact. I've never seen a lottery winner didn't turn out to be an asshole."</p>
<p>"I've only seen the one asshole today." Derek quipped, making Hilda once again shudder with humiliation.</p>
<p>"And yet I've seen two pussies." Hilda shot back. "You know you cheated to win and then you used weasely words to get me naked." Derek looked around, noticing that although a lot of eyes were on them, nobody was nearby, he gestured Hilda close to whisper into her ear.</p>
<p>"I've never seen you slip on an ice cube before, and I know you're not stupid enough to not notice the trick with the outfit. After our photoshoot you don't have to pretend you're not enjoying yourself. Give the word and I'll give you more fun and not tell a soul."</p>
<p>Hilda shuddered, harder and deeper than any comment on her exposed body or degraded status had made her shudder that night. Derek knew her deeper and more intimately than anyone else, and he was playing with her perversion like a child plays with a pet. He didn't want anything for himself except the status of being the one who took Hilda down a peg and the joy of knowing he could do it again at any time.</p>
<p>"Do it." Hilda whispered, barely believing what her traitorous mouth had said.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Derek yelled, backing away to address the bar, which immediately descended into silence at his exclamation. "I want witnesses to this, Hilda just said she's willing to go double or nothing." A hush fell over Big Mike's as all eyes turned to Hilda.</p>
<p>"You know if it wasn't for that fucking ice cube I wouldn't be here. So yeah, I want another go." Hilda yelled, playing along.</p>
<p>"Very well, if you can keep a smile on your face and not raise your voice until closing time at 2am, I'll get rid of all the banners and the photos on them. But if you can't, if another ice cube slithers it's way underneath you, I reckon same time tomorrow only with a cleaner chalk board."</p>
<p>"Derek it's been a long night and I'm tired of you speaking around the bush, state your terms plainly, like a human."</p>
<p>"Fine, if you can't keep a smile on your face, you do another shift naked tomorrow, only without the 'no photos, no videos, no touching' rules." Derek explained.</p>
<p>"No fucking way." Hilda instinctively reacted.</p>
<p>"I thought you said you could easily keep a smile on your face." Derek goaded. Hilda knew this was all theatre but still had to play her role.</p>
<p>"Alright, but if I win you also give me a grand, think of it as a modelling fee, and nobody is fucking me without my permission." Hilda replied, sweetening the pot to protect her status before shaking Derek's hand and going back to work.</p>
<p>Hilda had thought that her treatment so far had been pretty degrading, but upon hearing about the new bet the bar went into overdrive trying everything they could to get her smile to fade.</p>
<p>"Hey banana flapjacks, stop thinking about cocks for a moment and waddle that flabby ass over here, I need a drink." A man yelled.</p>
<p>"Coming right up sir." Hilda cheerfully replied, skipping over to him with a genuine smile.</p>
<p>"Nevermind, I'll probably catch crabs from any beer you pour." He dejectedly replied. If anything Hilda found the anger at her cheerfulness almost as enjoyable as the smiling whore persona she had affected.</p>
<p>"So do your parents know how big a whore their daughter turned out to be?" A more drunk man slurred from the corner of the bar.</p>
<p>"They don't know I'm serving drinks naked tonight if that's what you mean."</p>
<p>"Well if that pretty smile fades, I'm going to make sure they know. I'm going to take pictures and videos, I'm going to put them up all over the internet, I'll even print out a couple and post them to your dad's law firm. I'm going to make you famous."</p>
<p>"Looking forward to it." She replied, grinning the whole time, drinking in her humiliation and their frustration at how far she had fallen. The man dejectedly took a handful of ice and threw it on the floor at her feet before walking off.</p>
<p>"I think you're enjoying this." A different biker yelled, clearly not believing his words but trying to get a rise out of Hilda. "I think you are a depraved whore and you love everyone staring at your pointy tits and loose cunt."</p>
<p>"Don't forget my ass." Hilda chirped as she continued pouring pints with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>Both the clientele and Hilda were beginning to wonder what it would take to wipe the smile off her face, they were throwing everything they could at her and she was simply enjoying herself too much. Time was moving on and Hilda was starting to wonder if she would actually win the bet. Maybe tonight could be the seed of an idea, planted in the minds of the bikers and harvested at a later date. As she listened to another man give a play by play breakdown of all the ways her body was both disgusting and slutty, out of the corner of her eye she spotted what was going to be her undoing. The bikers had figured out a plan, and as sneakily as they could they were taking down all the clocks in the bar and moving them 5 minutes forward.</p>
<p>Her stomach began to fill with butterflies at the thought of what she was about to let herself in for as she rang the bell for last orders. There was a tense quietness to the bar which Hilda would have picked up on immediately if she was trying to win the bet in earnest. She served some beers, smiling through some now half hearted attempts to insult her, before deciding the best course of action was to stand next to one of the altered clocks and count down until it showed 2am.</p>
<p>"3... 2... 1... two o'clock bitches! Looks like none of you horndogs are going to see my body ever again." She gloated, drinking in the dam of frustration and resentment she was preparing to blow up. "Derek, I will be at your place bright and early tomorrow for my one thousand dollars and to watch the banners burn."</p>
<p>Big Mike's was positively humming in anticipation as Hilda geared up for her coup de grace, she had gone all tingly and numb at the thought of her ultimate humiliation. With one action, she was preparing to lock herself into being the bar's plaything. She was not going to be anonymous model, hovering above a freeway, protected and separated from her audience, she was going to be Hilda Grimsdottir, outsmarted sex object.</p>
<p>"And the rest of you bums, fuck off! It's closing time." She yelled with all the malice and anger she could muster.</p>
<p>The bar erupted into cheers and Hilda acted appropriately confused.</p>
<p>"I didn't think you were all rooting for me but thanks." Said Hilda uneasily.</p>
<p>"They're cheering because you just lost, sweetheart." Derek informed loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>
<p>"The bet was clear, I had to keep smiling until two o'clock when the bar closed. It's now two minutes past. You twist the rules a lot but I don't think this side of the bar is in a different time zone to that clock." Hilda replied.</p>
<p>"Check your phone." Derek instructed. Hilda clumsily pulled her phone out of the pocket of her trousers still abandoned on the floor. She made the appropriate look of horror as she saw the time. "We changed the clocks when you weren't looking. You stopped smiling at exactly five minutes to two."</p>
<p>Hilda dropped to her knees as the bar cheered around her. She decided the appropriate reaction was to run into the back room with her clothes and wait for everyone to leave so she could close up the bar.</p>
<p>Hilda had slept and she had stood in a daze, those were her only activities from when she got home from her shift to when she left again. She tried to watch TV, browse the internet, anything to take her mind off what she had been through and what she had agreed to. She checked her email inbox and found an email she had been expecting for a while, one that on any other day would have consumed her world but she couldn't bring herself to engage with the minutiae of bankruptcy law and property listings. The sale of the Ten Pines Mall would have to wait for another time.</p>
<p>She stood staring at a series of social media feeds and TV programs, not taking in any of them until her alarm cut through her fugue state and informed her that her time was nigh.</p>
<p>As she drove towards work, her eyes lingered on the now abandoned ad space she once dominated. Her mind went back to the days of being in complete control and still using it to discard her dignity, often paying for the privilege. Now she was giving herself up entirely, without anonymity or control, and she drove on to the location of her downfall.</p>
<p>As she parked outside, the bikers waved to greet her, no hint of awkwardness or bashfulness, they didn't need her to like them any more. Deb was on the previous shift and had been kept in the dark about why there were so many patrons and why they were so boisterous tonight, though she had spotted the banners and did warn Hilda, unaware that they were acting exactly as Hilda had encouraged.</p>
<p>The moment the door closed behind Deb, a sea of phones swarmed Hilda, eagerly awaiting her final degradation. The crowd parted for an employee of Derek's who had bought the most professional looking video camera Hilda had ever seen, clearly looking forward to capturing her night in the highest definition possible. Hilda rolled her eyes and began to undress.</p>
<p>Hilda had deliberately dressed light, one of her baggiest t-shirts and some comfortable leggings with sandals, no shoes or underwear to complicate the inevitable. She stripped herself with minimal fanfare, trying to look as much as possible like she was not enjoying herself. She dropped her leggings to the floor and went wide eyed at the swarm of flashing cameras and people moving to get a good view of her to capture for posterity. Derek's cameraman remained still but was clearly zooming in on Hilda's body. Then without warning, Derek hopped the bar, slid in behind Hilda, and for everyone to see gave her breasts a rough and firm squeeze.</p>
<p>The bar cheered, it was clear that nobody was planning on keeping their hands to themselves tonight. A couple of other men lept the bar and soon Hilda found herself being squeezed and probed from all angles, the hands clearly wanting to make a good show for the camera as well as humiliating their star. Hilda subtly thrust herself forward as her ass was grabbed, then shuffled her legs apart as a man opened up her pussy and the camera flashes intensified.</p>

<p>"Alright, alright, get off. I still need to work as a bartender tonight." Hilda explained, trying in vain to shake off the hands running up and down her body. Eventually they backed off, knowledgeable that the night was still young and they would need beers for the show ahead.</p>
<p>Hilda started pouring beers as she usually would, but now every man she served would take the opportunity to grope her, or have his photo taken with the naked bartender as he groped her. She didn't take orders, so as much as men asked her to blow them a kiss or to jump up and down, she just scowled and continued pouring pints.</p>
<p>"Hey Hilda, smile for the camera." A man ordered, Hilda of course responded with a middle finger which he delighted in just as much.</p>
<p>"Wait Hilda over here." Another man interrupted. "This video's going on the internet. Anything you want to say to the thousands of men who are gonna be jerking themselves off looking at your body?"</p>
<p>"You're all sad losers." Hilda replied.</p>
<p>Hilda was pretty mistreated at the bar, but that was nothing compared to the moments when she would leave the safety behind the bar to clean up glasses. The moment there was no longer a barrier between her and the customers, a sea of hands would wash over her body as she moved around the room, if she stopped her breasts and ass would be mercilessly squeezed and occasionally spanked. Whenever she put the tray on a table and evenly slightly bent over to start picking up the glasses, there was only one place the hands wanted to be and they were relentless in probing her most intimate holes. All the while Derek's cameraman followed her intently, swimming between the other cameras and phones that swarmed to immortalise Hilda's total humiliation.</p>
<p>Once she got behind the bar more men had arrived with more debasing ideas that they felt was witty given the circumstances.</p>
<p>"You wanna do double or nothing again so we can all fuck you?" One man asked, Hilda gave him a scowl that said no before words could leave her mouth that said yes.</p>
<p>"Hey Hilda, look at the camera for a second. So I'm still friends with Justin, the guy you dated in high school. Anything you want to say to him?" The man was someone Hilda recognised from her home town not far from here. He turned his phone around and sure enough Hilda could see her old boyfriend on a video call, staring at her with wide-eyed disbelief.</p>
<p>"I always knew you were a whore." He yelled over the phone.</p>
<p>"I lost a bet. And I would rather do this every night than touch your tiny prick ever again." Hilda angrily spat before turning her back on the phone and getting back to work.</p>
<p>"Terry, spank my whore ex's ass for me will you." Justin replied, to which the man holding the phone immediately agreed. Hilda carried on and tried to ignore him.</p>
<p>"Hey Hilda, this is all getting a bit much, you sure you're OK? One man yelled, to the booing of all his friends.</p>
<p>"I can handle it, I'm not a welch." Hilda replied, hiding the fact that it was rapidly turning into the best night of her life. She continued to serve customers, ignoring all attempts by Terry to get her attention as he was still there with his phone.</p>
<p>"Hey Hilda..."</p>
<p>"Look, I don't want to talk to Justin, OK?" Hilda cut him off.</p>
<p>"That's fair enough. You got anything you want to say to Mrs. Bell?" He asked, turning his phone around so Hilda could see the shocked face of her high school homeroom teacher.</p>
<p>"Oh, Hilda. You were always so smart, what are you doing?" She admonished in a tone that was caring yet firm, a tone she often used on her students. Hilda gave Terry an evil glare and decided she needed to nip this latest trend in the bud.</p>
<p>"Being smart is, like, totally boring. I'm a stupid whore now, it's way more fun." She mockingly announced before snatching the phone out of Terry's hands and hanging up. "If I see one more person I know on this phone, it's going down the toilet." Terry actually flinched at Hilda's sudden fury, but saved face by giving her nipples a small twist and watching her recoil with a squeak.</p>
<p>"Hey Hilda, so I heard the only ground rule is nobody gets to fuck you is that correct?" A new customer announced. Hilda nervously nodded in agreement, wondering what wicked designs this man had on her that would need such a clarification. She served him a beer and once again went to collect the glasses, hoping nobody noticed that she was far more diligent in this task than usual.</p>
<p>The usual sea of hands slowed her progress, but the worst was yet to come. As she started to pick up her tray with both hands, she felt a thin strip of plastic wrap around her wrists. There was then a rapid clicking noise as she felt her wrists being constricted together. The biker from the bar who had asked about the rules had decided there was no rule that said he couldn't use a zip tie to bind her hands together.</p>
<p>"Hey what the fuck." Hilda yelled, barely heard over the laughter that had greeted her new predicament. "How am I supposed to bartend with my hands tied?"</p>
<p>"Not our problem." The man replied walking away as Hilda unsteadily carried the tray of glasses back to the bar.</p>
<p>Hilda now poured beers much slower and was unable to defend herself against the squeezes and pinches she was now getting. She looked out over the bar and worried that the idea of zip ties had now been breached, every biker in the place carried a handful for on the road repairs and they were all thinking through the best way to use them.</p>
<p>"Hey Hilda, if you're not too busy being a slut can I get a beer over here please?" A biker yelled, his friends giggling along with him as Hilda unsteadily poured a pint with her hands bound. "How does it feel knowing everyone here's gonna be jerking off to pictures and videos of you for a long time?"</p>
<p>"Probably better than it feels to be the kind of man who needs someone else to win a bet just to see a woman naked." Hilda pithily replied, handing the man his beer. The man momentarily scowled before collecting himself, picking up his beer, and upending it over Hilda's head.</p>
<p>The bar watched in awe as Hilda's body became wet with cold beer, her skin now dewey and covered in goosebumps as her nipples stood on end.</p>
<p>"Not against the rules." The man shrugged. "Could I have another pint please?" Hilda scowled and began pouring another pint.</p>
<p>There was a lull in Hilda's humiliation that worried her. Sure the bar patrons kept on groping her, calling her names and documenting every moment of her humiliation, but the zip tie and the beer had opened their eyes that there was so much they could do that didn't break the one rule and everyone was maliciously brainstorming as fast as they could. Derek sauntered up to the bar with a grin across his mouth that worried Hilda.</p>
<p>"I'd like to set up a tab." He announced.</p>
<p>"OK..." Hilda's eyes narrowed. "Could I have a card please?" Derek gave Hilda his credit card and she placed it in the register. As she did so Derek jumped onto the bar to make an announcement to everyone.</p>
<p>"Alright guys, I'm going to cover all your drinks from now on." He yelled above the cheering of the bar. "So if you need another beer, just help yourself, no need to bother Hilda. I'll just check the CCTV at the end of the shift and settle up so she doesn't get in trouble."</p>
<p>Hilda glanced around wondering what could possibly happen next, as she did she felt her hands suddenly loosen, Derek had cut the zip tie holding her wrists together. She had a moment to savour her freedom before both her wrists were grabbed and pulled behind her back, being secured in place by a new zip tie. The barrier of her having to be able to bartend had just been removed, people started serving themselves which meant that Hilda's one and only remaining role was to be the bar's plaything. Derek led Hilda away from the bar, grinning with the new situation he had just enabled.</p>
<p>"Hey Hilda, going to be difficult to flush my phone down the toilet now." Terry yelled above the din. "So instead, have you got anything you want to say to Macy?"</p>
<p>Terry turned his phone around and a girl about Hilda's age was laughing at her. Macy was the pride and joy of Hilda's town, lead cheerleader, head of the girls track team, prom queen, and general antagonist to Hilda's young life. Sure the preppy girl and punk rivalry was a bit of a trope, but that didn't stop them clashing on more occasions than Hilda could count. When Hilda argued with her dad about her life, Macy stuck in Hilda's mind as the archetypal all-American girl he clearly wanted Hilda to be.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, I totally called this. Didn't I tell you that you would end up a biker slut?" Macy laughed.</p>
<p>"Macy! I'm sorry my friends here asked for my impression of you at a country club when a C-list celebrity walks in." Hilda shot back, not noticing just how much her naked predicament undermined any weight her insults could throw.</p>
<p>"Honey, last week Connor proposed to me. As well as planning my destination wedding, I'm also going to be running for election as a probate judge so I'm keeping pretty busy achieving all my dreams. Meanwhile you're a piece of cheap fuckmeat in the same biker bar I left you in when I went away to college. One of us is going to make something of ourselves, the other is going to be left with nothing but a sloppy cunt pushing out bastards for the welfare checks. Just admit it, I'm better than you."</p>
<p>"You're not better than me!" Hilda yelled.</p>
<p>"Well I'd love to stay and argue, but I've got better things to do than have a whore yell at me because her life is falling apart. See you at the next reunion!" Macy chirped before laughing and hanging up.</p>
<p>Hilda only had a moment to absorb the terrible blow to her ego before she felt another zip tie tightening around her head and across her mouth. It was a thick zip tie and once it pulled tight against her face it acted like a bit, keeping Hilda from biting down and garbling her words. The bikers laughed at her mangled attempts to admonish them, suddenly cut with a scream as another pint was upended over her.</p>
<p>"Guys, when you pour things over Hilda it makes the floor all messy, let's take it outside." Derek yelled, pushing Hilda towards the door despite whatever feeble objections she could conjure. As she moved closer to the door she felt another zip tie closing around her elbows, pulling them closer together and forcing her to thrust out her chest. She let out a mangled grunt of pain as her elbows reached beyond a comfortable point, but it was immediately silenced by someone pouring a shot of whiskey into her mouth.</p>
<p>The cool night air whipped around Hilda's body as she was pulled out of the bar and towards the outdoor seating area looking out onto the road. The swarm of bikers behind her confirming that this would be her place for the rest of her shift. She stared wide-eyed at the traffic driving by as another shot of whiskey was poured down her throat. She found it helped with the cold and the thudding pain starting to arise in her arms.</p>
<p>The outdoor part of Big Mike's was a series of picnic tables on a rough concrete ground between the bar and the road, they took Hilda to the furthest one from the bar and sat her down facing outwards towards the road. They forcibly spread her legs, then zip tied her ankles to the far sides of the bench so she was forced to spread herself wide for the cars passing by.</p>
<p>The familiar slowing of traffic and eyes on her body washed over Hilda, but this time she was not some anonymous model hovering above it all, she was on the street, undisguised, tied outside the bar she worked at. Nothing could stop her being subjected to whatever whims the collective madness of the bikers allowed and there was no walking away from it afterwards. She tried to whimper but instead choked down another shot of whiskey thrown into her mouth.</p>
<p>She felt the plastic loop of another zip tie, lassoing itself around her left breast, before unerringly tightening.</p>
<p>"Yeah, let's make those pointy tits of hers stand to attention!" One of the bikers yelled as her breast squeezed and constricted around the base, not so tight to cause damage, but enough to make it bulge outwards. Hilda moaned in humiliation as a second zip tie got looped around her right breast to give it the same treatment. The dull ache offset by another shot of whiskey in her mouth, and the biker who had decided to take this opportunity to start fingering her unguarded pussy.</p>
<p>Hilda moaned and squirmed as the gathered bikers watched her, they laughed at her tits comedically bulging and bouncing with every squeak of shock and pleasure as the biker didn't slow down. Hilda closed her eyes tight at the wellspring of feeling about to erupt, she was vaguely aware of the sound of a car pulling up, then very aware of the fingering stopping just short of glorious release. She opened her eyes and stood in front of her was Macy, laughing at her rival.</p>
<p>"Sorry Hilda, but I knew I couldn't just leave it at a phone call, not when you're whoring yourself out only a five minute drive from my large, expensive house." Macy laughed. The bikers were hostile at first, but then they saw how much Macy was making Hilda squirm and decided to allow her to do what she wanted.</p>
<p>"I mentioned the reunion earlier, did you know I'm organising it this year? You never show up so I didn't think it mattered but then I remembered this year we're doing follow-up yearbooks for everyone to circulate and sign. With news of what everyone is doing and most importantly..." Macy paused to get all of Hilda's current situation in frame of the camera phone now pointing right at her. There was a flash of light as Macy captured her bound and degraded rival. "...updated yearbook photos."</p>
<p>Hilda screamed and swore through her zip tie gag as Macy popped her phone back in her bag with a smug grin. She sauntered through the crowd of bikers until she was looming over Hilda, looking down at her.</p>
<p>"You always were a stupid slut loser, and I'm going to make sure everyone knows it." She sneered, before spitting on Hilda's degraded body and skipping back to her car.</p>
<p>"Goddamn, what did you do to piss her off?" One of the bikers asked, while another tipped his beer over the globule of spit to wash it off Hilda's body, and a third poured another shot of whiskey down her throat. Hilda couldn't really articulate her words for the others, but she had to admit to herself that had the roles been reversed she probably would have done worse.</p>
<p>Hilda barely had a moment to watch Macy's car drive over the horizon when the biker went back to fingering her pussy. After all the humiliation she had just suffered, the bikers were surprised by the screaming orgasm she had almost the moment one of them started touching her again. Hilda moaned and wailed as her body shook and shivered with overwhelming sensations.</p>
<p>"Are you sure we can't fuck her?" One biker yelled above the mob.</p>
<p>"Nobody here is a welch, the terms of the bet were that nobody got to fuck her, alright." Derek yelled. The bikers all agreed and the one who spoke up was appropriately admonished. While the discussion went on another biker decided to get clever with a zip tie, tying Hilda's wrists to the bench she was sat on, forcing her to thrust her punished tits forward and keep her head up with the angle required.</p>
<p>"Well if we can't fuck her I don't know what more we can do with her." One biker yelled above the din.</p>
<p>"We only have an hour until the bar closes and she goes free. Think of something." Another added.</p>
<p>"It's not fucking her if we just jizz on her naked body is it?" A guy asked, instantly splitting the group about if that was in the spirit of the bet. While they argued someone else had come through with an idea, they had run inside and fetched a pool cue, they began to move it into position and Hilda obligingly thrusted her body off the bench long enough for him to slide it between her legs and under her before zip tying it in place. She now found herself grinding a pool cue against her pussy with every move she made and it spurred her on to yell to get everyone's attention.</p>
<p>"Ai'm nor ah eurelch" Hilda labouriously announced around her zip tie gag.</p>
<p>"Are you saying you're not a welch?" A man translated, to which Hilda nodded.</p>
<p>"Does that mean your saying cumming on you was part of the bet?" Derek asked, his cameraman zooming in to Hilda's face as she closed her eyes and nodded.</p>
<p>The effect was instant, the biker who first proposed the idea wasted no time diving to the front of the crowd and whipping his cock out. Hilda moaned and grinded on the pool cue as the man took no time at all to surge and then release a line of cum that splashed over her chin and tied tits. No sooner was he done than a couple of other bikers joined the action. Soon Hilda was moaning and thrusting as she became covered in one cumshot at a time. Her body became sticky and wet as she screamed with delight, the pool cue doing its job as effectively as the dripping jizz in making her feel uniquely erotic and debased.</p>
<p>Each new splash of cum a new degradation that Hilda converted into her personal sexual pleasure as she ground her pussy raw on the pool cue. No part of her was spared, her body became caked in jizz while the zip tie holding her mouth open ensured more than a little ended up trickling down her throat, often chased with another shot of whiskey. Time swirled in an erotic haze until no more bikers wanted anything to do with the moaning, semen covered sex meat tied to the table.</p>
<p>Eventually bikers started to drive away, the bar had passed closing time and an increasing number of the patrons didn't want to be around to deal with the fallout of Hilda's debauchery. Derek eventually took it upon himself to fetch the hose often used to wash down the outdoor area and turn it upon Hilda, washing away the cum and shocking her out of sexual stupor.</p>
<p>Once sufficiently hosed off Derek got some scissors and cut Hilda out of her restraints until she fell to the floor shivering with cold and regret.</p>
<p>"You had a few drinks tonight. Wanna sleep it off at my place?" Derek asked, the subtext totally clear.</p>
<p>"No thanks." Hilda replied, "I'll sleep it off in the bar." Stumbling through the doors and leaving Derek to chuckle to himself as he made his way home.</p>
<p>Hilda had the kind of brief and deep sleep she missed from her old drunken nights out. She woke up naked on the bar and immediately dressed so she could get to work groggily cleaning up the destruction from the previous night.</p>
<p>She reconciled the till and true to his word, Derek had accounted for all the drinks that had been drunk and paid the tab. If she could clean up the devastation and cause a "technical issue" with the CCTV files before anyone else noticed, there wouldn't be any trouble for her employment, though the ship had thoroughly sailed on the lifelong humiliation she would suffer from the echoes of last night.</p>
<p>She did not expect Big Mike to walk through the door as she mopped up the excessive spilled drinks from the floor.</p>
<p>"Rough night eh. I'm guessing word got to the lads before I could." He casually announced picking up a bag to clear away the detritus that littered his bar. Hilda had no idea what he was talking about but decided to roll with it. He was hardly the most hands-on of bosses and preferred to be on the road instead of micro-managing his bar, so Hilda knew not to rock the boat on the sweet deal she had.</p>
<p>"Is it true?" She asked, trying to find out what he was talking about while pretending she knew.</p>
<p>"Afraid so. This place has been a money pit for a while. Truth is I've been showing investors around for a while, I really tried to sell it to someone who would keep the bar open but now I have to cut my losses and just go with someone who wants the land and location."</p>
<p>Hilda was too hungover and filled with shame to have to deal with this sort of bombshell but she stilled herself and collected her thoughts.</p>

<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>"I know you didn't want word getting out, but maybe one of our regulars is wealthy enough to buy the place, or have a bunch of us go in on shares." Hilda pleaded, not realising how much she loved her job until it was now I'm jeopardy.</p>
<p>"I'm not gonna put this on one of my regulars, this here's an albatross, I'm happy to let Bananabee's take the hit instead."</p>
<p>"Motherfucking Bananabee's. Fuck me that's bleak. You think I'm perky enough to be an Bananabee's waitress?"</p>
<p>"Sorry Hilda. There's still time for others to put in a bid but I don't see anyone else wanting in on this."</p>
<p>"...Fuck."</p>
<p>Hilda sat in her room staring at her laptop, four pertinent windows open as she flicked between them. On one page was the email confirmation of her meeting with a the commercial bank offering her great rates on a business loan when it saw the size of her savings and that she had an unmortgaged house to add as collateral.</p>
<p>The next was the email from Big Mike's lawyers, confirming that the amount she was offering was not the highest bid, but if she could confirm she was going to keep the bar running, Big Mike was minded to take her lower offer.</p>
<p>In another window she had an email from her father, though he didn't know it was his daughter that he was corresponding with. He was outlying the obligations her shell company would be taking on if she agreed to their deal to purchase the derelict Ten Pines Mall site.</p>
<p>Hilda had to choose which lawyer she would be responding in the affirmative to, she could not afford both. If she chose the bar, she could keep turning up and occasionally have a lascivious bet turn against her. But if she went for the mall, through the shell company she could return it to being locked up and derelict so she could go back to sneaking into the ad space. She could retreat back into anonymity, pushing herself further than she would think possible, plus the business was pretty profitable when she wasn't handing money back to enhance her sexual thrill.</p>
<p>The fourth window she had open was the porn site where a familiar video called 'Crazy Bartender strips naked at work' was playing on repeat.</p>
<p>Hilda awkwardly finished her pudding as her mum and dad sat in silence across from her. Every normal topic of conversation had been shuffled off limits by the convention of not acknowledging Hilda's most egregious fall from social grace.</p>
<p>Her father would have talked about how local golden girl Macy had surprisingly lost the election for probate judge, but then he would have to acknowledge that the voters turned against her when a scandal broke because she turned up in the middle of a humiliation porn video to be spiteful and malicious to Hilda as she was naked and bound outside her bar.</p>
<p>Her mother could have mentioned how nice it is that Hilda now insisted on paying for them when they went out to eat, even if it was just a visit to Bananabee's. But then she would have to acknowledge the rumours that swelled about how she was making her money.</p>
<p>Her dad couldn't even talk about the latest difficulties with the legal status of the Ten Pines Mall, having put two and two together on the stories he had heard about Hilda and the stories he had heard about the Ten Pines ad space.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances, her mother certainly didn't want to talk about if she had met anyone special or if she was planning to raise a family.</p>
<p>Hilda relished the awkwardness, in her mind it was the ultimate victory, her success in chasing a dream and getting paid handsomely for it didn't require her to become someone her parents wanted to be, someone like Macy. They couldn't argue she wasn't successful, but they also couldn't acknowledge it because she did it despite their disapproval.</p>
<p>"This was fun." Hilda acknowledged, placing her card on the tiny tray and letting the waitress go through the rigamarole of taking it away only to bring it back inside a card reader.</p>
<p>"Are you... um... working tonight?" Her mother asked.</p>
<p>"Looks like it. It's nice that I don't have to work every day now but sometimes I have to pull a shift and tonight looks like one such occasion." Hilda remarked while checking her phone. She shared the awkward hugs with her parents then strolled out into the car park where her Harley was waiting for her.</p>
<p>Hilda took her familiar route, to the business choice she had made and stood by every day. She turned the corner on her bike and a grin crossed her face as she once again saw the big neon sign, rechristening the biker bar as 'Hilda's'.</p>
<p>There was always some commotion whenever Hilda visited her bar, there were many reasons she could be visiting, she could be there to do some accounts or cover shifts of absent employees. But if everyone was lucky she could be there to indulge the unique premise she had given her bar.</p>
<p>The bartender nodded at her, Hilda had no idea where some fellow freaks had come from but the bar was now fully staffed with people with similar sensibilities to her. Behind the bar and offset so as not to get in the way of serving drinks, each bartender had a table, matching up the colours of a spinner wheel with a kinky punishment, usually completing their shift in a state of undress or going through a humiliating ordeal. Every 1000th customer for that specific bartender would get to spin the wheel.</p>
<p>Beyond that there was one more board that occupied everyone's mind. Hilda's board. After every 10,000 customers one lucky person would get to spin the wheel to see what the owner of the bar would do for their amusement. Hilda had deliberately picked the most extreme scenarios for herself.</p>
<p>Red: Hilda does a shift as a naked bartender and gives all earnings from that shift to the customer.</p>
<p>Orange: Hilda spends a shift handcuffed naked to a toilet in the men's bathroom.</p>
<p>Yellow: Customer gets to drive Hilda naked on the back of their bike for ten minutes. When ten minutes are up, Hilda gets off and has to walk back to the bar.</p>
<p>Green: Hilda gets a tattoo of the customer's choice.</p>
<p>Blue: Hilda is the customer's slave for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Purple: Customer gets to destroy Hilda's clothes, phone, wallet, keys, and any other possessions she currently has on her.</p>
<p>Pink: Hilda now owes the customer $1000. She is not allowed to pay them directly and must instead perform services for others, from which the customer collects the fee until her debt is paid off.</p>
<p>Black: All of the above.</p>
<p>Hilda let her glance linger on the board for a moment before heading over to the bar.</p>
<p>"Busy night Deb?"</p>
<p>"Every night's a busy night with your... loyalty rewards." Deb replied, she had been the most surprising discovery, always seeming so no-nonsense in their conversations between shifts and yet Hilda had now seen her volunteer more more exposure then she ever thought of her long time coworker. "You here for that?"</p>
<p>Hilda checked the app that Derek's tech guy had built into the sales system to track this crazy promotion and its progress.</p>
<p>"Between you and me, that guy you just served was customer nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety four." Hilda whispered in Deb's ear, her stomach churning in anticipation.</p>
<p>"Well I better call the babysitter because this is going to be a hell of a night and I'm not going to miss any of it." Deb remarked.</p>
<p>"Hilda!" Derek announced as he approached the bar. "Good to see you again, have you heard the news?"</p>
<p>"Got to be more specific."</p>
<p>"The old Ten Pines Mall, someone else bought it and then went bankrupt before they could do anything with it. But whatever work they did has meant that the adverts in that room above the freeway are back."</p>
<p>When Hilda decided to buy the bar instead of the mall, the next highest bidder was a private prison company who thought the remote location could work to their favour. They put a sturdy wall around the perimeter then did not get the contract they wanted to actually house prisoners. With the building resecured all Hilda needed to do was take a hacksaw to the police door locks and she was able to restart the old business of renting the ad room for fun and profit.</p>
<p>"What do you think? Should I put another banner up there?" Derek joshed.</p>
<p>"You'd have to wait in line. I got a special advert planned for the bar that I'm sure the person in charge will want to put up."</p>
<p>"Looking forward to it. I was thinking we could have another bet, after all..." Derek's thought was interrupted as a blaring siren went off above the till. A biker looked confused for a moment then a big smile crossed his face as he realised the siren meant he was the 10,000th customer. Hilda broke away from Derek without a word to talk to the lucky winner.</p>
<p>"Congratulations, you are our 10,000th customer. Please step forward to spin the owner wheel." Hilda announced, moving the man over to the wheel that had made this bar famous. She gave him a kiss on the cheek, then stood back and watched as the wheel spun.</p>
<p>This moment; the blur of colours and the rapid clicks of the pointer echoing through her mind, the tingle of excitement in her belly as she awaited her fate, the overwhelming sensory overload of imminent humiliation, this was all Hilda Grimsdottir lived for now.</p>
